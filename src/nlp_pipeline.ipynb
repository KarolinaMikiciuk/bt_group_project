major delay bt staff not botherd and kept blaming everyone else its now the begining of december and im still waiting to be connected steer well clear of bt and its associates shocking display on how to run a company and would not reccomend them to anyone even my worst enemy', 'just read some reviews and realised that the worst service ive ever experienced is normal for bt  how can this company be so poor at delivering what they promise  organise  im going to email the ceo to see if they are interested or aware of how poor the bt company has become', 'worst internet i ever had in my 22 year life i have 2 month problem with internet speed and they just dont care worst service with everlasting response from our side all is well', 'never again  so bad that i raised and held an ombusdman complaint against bt', 'just tried to call and speak to bt about scammers pretending to be them  i had numbers etc for them on the 2 occasions i got through to bt they both hung up  not interested at allgood luck to anyone ever dealing with bt  dreadful customer service', 'i would not recommend bt to anyone what should have been a simple and easy case of transferring my existing account and service to my new address when i moved house has been an absolute nightmare they cancelled part of my order on my moving day took over two weeks to put the new order through leaving me without a working landline or internet service for a number of days  billed me for an increased tarrif at my old address account after id moved out  assured me that they wouldnt debit my account for this incorrect bill but did anyway  theyve also set my new account up on a higher tarrif then originally agreed  and have ignored my last six emails to the home moves team trying to get this all resolved whod promised me a call back two weeks ago  but who still havent called me ive also spent hours repeatedly on hold also trying to get through to someone to get it sorted im currently on the phone to bt in a queue and have already been on hold for over an hour this morning ive lodged complaints which have not been dealt with  and this is still dragging on six weeks after first advising them of my house move absolutely unacceptable way to treat their customers ill be raising this with the ombudsman if bt dont get it all sorted out soon if youre thinking of moving to bt id advise you to avoid at all costs  id really wished that id just switched to a new service provider when i moved house', 'router is excellent  full speeds on wifi upstairs i pay fot 50meg and usually get 42meg  no down time at all in last 18 months  free antivirus plus other perks etc  pricey  but you get what you pay for', 'horrible service  have paid for my contract with them  a month has passed and they still havent implemented the equipment and the wifi in my place have had 5 arranged appointments with them  and every time the engineer did not show up and did not even inform  completely unacceptable  horrible service and reliability  every time you try and contact them you have to wait for one hour  and every time someone says they will fix it and then the appointment does not got through  also  they promise to call you back  but eventually no once calls you  so you have to call them again and wait for one hour until someone replies', 'disgusted by all service with bt wont give them a rating for anything  they just fob you off when you have a problem', 'after years of sub 5 mbs speed  and waiting to be connected to fibre about 300 yards from the house  we installed 4g broadband  we now get 3035mbs download  and about 1015mbs upload  this may be pretty pathetic for city dwellers but if you live in the countryside you will appreciate that these numbers are high  so if you live in the middle nowhere  like us  it might be worth trying a 4g service  we needed an aerial on the outside of the house  but bt installed that for free  a rare example of good customer service  we pay £50 monthly and are capped at 500gb monthly  but again  having tolerated miserably bad speeds for years were quite happy at the moment', 'worst service i have ever experienced new installation  they ddnt turn up 2 times to the appointment finally intalled was working ok for a month and then they canelled it a new order had to be  made and start all over again  have been without service for more than a week now and no end in sight pathetic avoid', 'been without network connection for nearly 4 weeks now firstly i was told that it was an external problem and would be sorted within 5 days i then had a text to say the problem had been sorted it hadnt another hour long call and they arranged a house visit and i had to wait another 5 days i booked a day off work at 230 i had an email to say i needed to book an engineer to fix my problem i telephoned bt again an they said this is where the lies start an engineer had been and there was nobody at the premises the engineer then phoned my mobile and i cancelled i asked the advisor if he could confirm the number the engineer rang and the number i was given did not belong to me  or anyone in my householdanother appointment was made for the following day  guess what yes it was cancelled again  through an email telling me again that i needed to book an engineer another hour long call to bt  this time they couldnt give me a reason as to why they had cancelled i told them i wish to terminate my contract with them and they told me i had 12 months left and would have to pay the outstanding amount£460  the first oppertunity i get to leave this supplier i will they said openreach was the problem and they they do all the broadband regardless of my supplier i said that bt are the company i pay and its up to them to provide the service i pay a lot for', 'most days at some point  i get the message your computer is not connected   i have breeze block walls the signal only had to travel 3 to 5 metres ', 'our experience with bt is absolutely horrible we signed up with them only because they were the only provider offering over 100mb speed at our current address they booked us an engineer visit on two occasions which theyve missed both  then 3rd time lucky  but leaving us without internet for 5 weeks now we are moving home and they can only offer us 30mb to 60mb at the new address they wanted us to sign a fresh new contract on 30mb for a further 24months of course  we want out of our contract since they cannot honor their part of the deal  virigin can offer us up to 500mb they are not allowing us to leave without a buyout fee which is ridiculous since they want us to go on a fresh contract  it only shows that the old one does not stand  absolutely horrible', 'internet down for 2 weeks now from first day promised will come back in 24 hrs  never did  both my wife and i opened complaints and got assigned case owner  never heard back  not even an email nor phone call   and now my complaint marked off as completed and resolved without any feedback or progress  openreach staff told me outside on main road it was their fault as they mixed cables  transferring greenboxes on the first day of internet loss  i wish i could mark no stars on this  but trustpilot only allows me to mark lowest 1 star  absolute appalling  both of us rely on the internet at home for income  during covid  if my phone signal was good enough in area or if i had an alternative option  i would have swapped already ', 'an absolute joke of a company in terms of service and looking after your new customers we were due internet on friday and one and a half weeks later were still speaking to support to even get an engineer sent out the initial engineer wasnt able to complete work outside the flat due to requiring a hoist to get up the pole  however he just left and never told us even though we were just across the road had to phone back  get another engineer booked for wednesday  never showed up had to book a new one for friday  now there was an error in their booking system and so never showed up  booked again for the following monday  and yet again the same system error meant that no engineer showed up on the day we only find this out after each of the noshows and not in advance now weve been told that the error is meant to be fixed by tuesday and only then can we book an engineer again which will likely be at least another few days to a week  all in all we set up to become a customer over a month ago to be live 2 weeks ago  seems that planning ahead means absolutely nothing the empty promises and poor service is endless  and at this point any trust in the company is completely gone', 'i wanted to post this as a complaint on their site but before i had finished posting it  it was already closed showing they clearly care about your feedback i cant be bothered to change this text so thats its not directly addressing them but i want to post this to get this off my chest so keep that in mindmy situation was this  i am currently using bt in my apartment and have been doing so for a year and a half recently  i bought a new house and the keys to the house would be handed to me on the 19th october in anticipation for this day  i went to the bt website on the 6th of october and had ordered for new broadband to be set up for the 22nd in this new house on the 13th  the week before  i received an email saying that this order had been cancelled confused  i called in to bt to try and understand the situation i explained my circumstance to the person on the phone and asked him what could have been the reason for the cancellation  and he said he did not know i then asked him if it was possible that the people who were currently staying in the house who were about to move out  were the ones who cancelled it and he said it was possible okay i said  i could see how if the previous tenants got a call saying that their internet was going to be changed granted that it was going to be taken over on a date where they would not be in the house then i could see how a mix up could occur i asked the man on the phone if it would be possible to make the order again and which time it would be best to do so he said that it would be alright to make the order right away if i knew i was definitely going to be at the house by the 19th i said i was sure i would be in the house by then  but i wanted him to be sure that i could make this order and this would not happen again he assured me that it would be fine we make the order again and i can see that it was made for the 27th of october this is a lot far down than i would like it to be but i thought it was fine if this is the best time they could do and i know things are stressful at the moment so i dont want to push anything a week passes and the weekend before the 27th comes around and i receive no notice of bt making their order which i thought was odd as i thought bt would always give me small reminders that they were coming especially when you compare it to all the process of all furniture shops and gadget shops that ive been seeking patronage from for this new house as this is the standard process for all of themthe 26th comes around and the delivery of my equipment has not been made yet i track my order online and above it says that my order is cancelled but below it looks as if my order is still on track for my house confused  i call into the bt help desk to ask them what the true status of my order is the guy checks my order and says he noticed the cancellation that was made before but that this current order is still on track but there were just some delays he said that it should really arrive the next day or the day after i feel relieved as he has reassured me that the order was still on track and happy that i could finally set up my internet so that i could move in and get my house together while working from homethe next day comes and nothing arrives  and no email or text message arrives telling me they are still making the delivery i decide to call in again to reconfirm that the order is definitely on its way only to be told that this new order was actually cancelled by the previous people again and it was done on the 15th now i am seriously confused and frustrated and extremely disappointed i tell the assistant i had not received any message indicating that this had happened and that someone had told me yesterday that the order was on its way she apologizes profusely and says theres nothing she can do except make the order for me again and that it should come on the 10th of november i ask her if there is any way she can move it up and she says no i feel really dejected at this point so the lady encourages me to call in until someone makes a cancellation and i can take their spot i felt a bit better after hearing this and decided that i would trynow today comes which is the 28th of october  and i decide to call in to first check the status of my order to confirm it is definitely on its way and to see if there were any cancellations the man that answered assured me that the order is on its way but told me there was no way for me to take the spot of cancellations and move up my date i told him this was not what was told to me the day before and he tells me that the lady must have been wrong again  i feel dejected again and he apologizes by giving my £10 credit for my phone which i wont use and that he will lodge a complaint for me but frankly  both things dont make me feel better about the situation now i completely acknowledge my fault in trying to order the internet before i had fully moved into my new house i should not have assumed that because i had paid for the house  had a date set for when we would exchange keys and know that the tenants were definitely moving out that the process would have been smooth and without hiccups however  i wish to address the parts that were lacking on the bt side and were improvement could be added1communication  the first problem stems from the fact that i did not receive an email or text message or a phone call or anything letting me know of the second cancellation had i been allowed to know immediately after  i would have waited for the 19th to come  knowing we had full rights to the house so there should be no reason for a new cancellation  and made a new order where it wouldnt take so much time for my internet to be installed2staff collectively and consistently knowing the process  as i stated above  i talked to several people within bt in order to sort this out and i was given very different information from all of them if it was a situation where i stayed quiet and just accepted everything at face value  then i wouldnt make such a fuss for this point but that was not the case  i constantly asked questions in order to reassure or reconfirm my suspicions i asked the first guy if it were possible that the order could be cancelled again  and he said it would not i asked the second guy if the order was still on track and he said that it was i asked the third lady if i could call back and move up my installation date  if there was a cancellation and she said that i could  only to be told by the 4th guy that i cant what is going to happen if i call the 5th time what is going to be contradicted now this is the genuine paranoia that i have been left with and it will not fade until i am sure there is internet in my house i understand staff having flexibility to appease their customers but knowing what limits can and cannot be set should be understood by all in order to not create any confusion3lastly  making the process faster  i am not going to lie  this point comes from a more selfish request  but i still want to be able to voice it i understand that fulfilling orders can be hard especially in a time where we are in lockdown and we are supposed to be appeasing to social distancing rules but i find it so frustrating when i have ordered something and it is consistently pushed back more and more and more i made this order early because i wanted to make sure everything could be organised if there is internet not only could i start living in the new house and effectively put furniture together  but i could start working properly from home for the new job that i just acquired i would not have to spend money on bus tickets or expensive taxis so that i can be there in time for furniture orders just to go back through the same method to my apartment for work i would not have to spend exorbitant amounts of energy going from my apartment to my house and back again just to sort things out i wanted to sort out my apartment so that it could be left in good condition and i could get my full deposit back i most importantly i wanted my house to be sorted out before my family came for the holidaysoverall  i think that bt internet has been exceptionally good however you have issues when it comes to first delivering that service to people i have lived in different places for work and education and this issue with delivery is not the first time ive experienced this there was even a time where i ordered for your broadband service and it did not start working until after about 2 months and a half and this was mainly due to the fact the house was not suited for the broadband that i wanted  so someone had to come in and physically install it waiting at this point was not an issue because i had access to the bt public wifi  so i was able to do the things i needed to do and the situation wasnt so dire however  at this new house the signal is so bad that i cannot connect to anything and therefore i cant do anything this issue where the house is not suited for the broadband that i want  could happen again but i would not know until i try to get the internet started and that would lead to more waiting which again will just make me more frustrated i am not expecting any improvements on my situation to be made i just wanted to voice my frustrations in the hope that in the future  me or anyone else do not have to go through this', 'broadband keeps cutting out had more serious outages in 3 months with bt than 10 years with virgin bt can only book engineers a week ahead  and even then they arent guaranteed to show up even when they did turn up they sent someone to fix the phone rather than the broadband avoid at all

ever had would not recommend to my worst enemy', 'hindsight  they say is a wonderful thing had i read the reviews before deciding to try bt i would never have agreed to a contract at the moment i am two weeks without internet thanks to a neighbour im using their internet if possible i would give zero stars to all of the above i spent over an hour on the phone trying to speak to someone on wednesday and when i did get through i was told i would be getting a call back on sunday  thats tomorrow for an update when i contacted them over two weeks ago about an engineer calling to investigate the problem i was sent a confirmation email from bt but two minutes later a second email was sent telling me that there was a delay so they couldnt give me a time when it would be addressed i wont say fixed because i cant see that happening i may just have to cut my losses and ask for a disconnection ill probably pay through the nose for it but at least i can try another broadband company maybe someone more reliable i see positive review here but to be honest i think they must be from bt staff either that or someone who is being paid to write imaginary reviews', 'terrible customer service up

'drops in speed all the time zoom calls cut off regularly in these times of home working we need a more reliable service when my contract tie in ended they quickly bumped me up to £40 month even

they are doing no broadband now for 3 months cant get out of contract until they say so   shambles passed onto 8 different operators to sort   worst service ever', 'if youre thinking about switching to bt broadband because of the bt reward card incentive then beware they seem to be making it difficult to claim this  despite them claiming it should appear automatically on your account my own experience was that the reward card never appeared on my account after contacting live chat to enquire about this  the adviser said he could not transfer me to the relevant department and told me to phone instead this would have involved wasting more of my time because of the long waiting time on the helpline a quick google search of bt reward card  and filtering by the past month shows lots of people complaining about not receiving reward cards  showing this is a current widespread issue so unless youre prepared to waste time chasing this up  then dont expect to get the card the broadband itself has been excellent im on a fttp connection which is fast and reliable its just a shame that this experience with the reward card has soured my opinion', 'i get 73  mbps download and 18 upload

midlands got put through to the manager who said he had sorted it out he put records straight and made another appointment with outreach to come out the following monday when we had arranged to have the key from the landlord they came out the friday before when no one was at there my son was in lectures at uni this is his flat he is in his last year and needs the internet for his dissitation the engineer rang me and i told him i we had been told he would be there on monday and we had arranged for the key to wires to be there on that date monday came no engineer so we rang bt they rang outreach no appointment had been made for that date  or so they say they made another date for the following wednesday morning wednesday morning came and went no engineer so we rang again they rang outreach apparently the engineer was running late but my son had to do some shopping which i said i would do he also had to go to a meeting with university officer training corps uotc at 4pm he was fuming and quite rightly so anyway i pick up his shopping and go over to take over from him there is an outreach van there i speak to the engineer he was working at a neighbour id just missed our engineer i should ring bt and  they can ring the office to get him back my son was in the building he had the key i cant get in without it i go into the flat and ring bt the woman refused to ring

on making the order she put the phone down on me when i asked for the manager  the one who supposedly made an appointment for the previous monday i rang my other son turned up also at university with his phone so i asked him to get up my emails to get my account number and i rang them again they asked my name i told them they told me they had no account in that name so i told them my account number they said that was a false account number all their account numbers begin with gt and not bt which is what my a email said it was he then listened to my story and i asked him if he could ring outreach he told me he didnt deal with broadband only broken land lines yet it was the same number id rang before all this took an hour on the phone he said he would get me transferred to someone who could help  but he was busy so it couldnt do it for 12 hour there is about 5 min wait for me to ring so he said he would ring back i said with 5 mins he said 10mins so i waited someone rang who was prepared to ring outreach to ask why he had not rung the bell she asked for my name the address twice telephone number and my account number which suddenly was the correct one and my security question by this time my son had missed his important meeting with the utoc he will now be in trouble by this time of course it was a whole 2hrs later and getting dark of course the engineer wasnt going to

had since 2003 worst ever customer service worst ever order management worst ever technical execution worst ever liars when it comes to explanations why they did not do what they had promised to do worst ever incompetent technical staff when it comes to telephone number managements please read on for a substantiation of these statements here is my story i placed an order to bt on the phone on 14aug2016 for a telephone service  broadband  bt tv and bt sports the customer adviser promised that i would keep my existing telephone number  that the service would start in 7 to 15 days time and certainly by 30aug and that i would not be without a telephone and internet for longer than 4 hours  and at maximum only 24 hours all these promises turned out to be empty words  it is now 63 days later and i have been without internet for 35 days and of course also without bt tv and bt sports too  these were never delivered and to add insult to injury bt have changed my landline telephone number to a new random number  i had had my old number for 15 years and all my friends and relatives have that number however  bt despite actually promising to keep my number they had promised this in writing changed my landline number without any warning to me or consent on my side so  after placing the order on 14aug  nothing happened till 01sept except that bt cancelled my order without any request from me  without any warning to me or even an explanation  just an email that bt had now canceled the placed order thats it  simple and plain upon calling them on 01sept they explained that they had to canceled the order due to an internal system error in their order management system for which they had to apologize terribly and profoundly and then they promised that they would now recreate the cancelled order and start providing services by 14sept i wanted to speak to bt complaints department and explain that i had not waited for 17 days in order to be told that bt had done nothing at all for this time and that i needed again to start from zero and wait for another 14 days however  there is no complaints department in bt  a customer can only call and complain to the bt order management department  which is the same department that mismanaged my order in the first place as an additional aggravating factor  the bt order management department is located in india and there they do know a trick or two on how to deal with the customers  here is a verifiable list of such tricks i had other tricks played on me  but i do not remember all of them    a they places you on hold and then quietly hang up    b they say that they will put you through to the customer options team  but all they do is put you to the back of the calls queue to their own department the bt order management dept and you simply wait on the line for another 1525 minutes in order to speak with another adviser from the same department and be asked to explain everything again and again    c they say that they will put you through to talk to a manager  since your case is so serious and urgent  and then they simply leave you on the line to listen to a ringing tone for 20  30  40 mins or until you despair and hang up    d they say that they will need to discuss the matter with someone else  who has the authority to resolve your problems immediately  and they promise to call you back within not more than 60 minutes then they hang up and you are left waiting in vain for 60  120  180 minutes for them to call back  but they never call back  not even 2  3  4  6 days later    e they tell you that they have recorded your complaint and that a manager will call you after 7 days to discuss the complaint  they set a date and even tell you between which times the manager would call only  no manager calls on that date  nor on the following day nor in the following 3 days upon calling them again and asking them why no one called they explain that they have no record of this complaint or of the agreed callback  but that they will now log this second complaint and a manager will call you in another 7 days time  they set the date and tell you the times you know the story by now no one calls back on this second time too  not on the third time in another 7 days  not on the fourth time in yet another 7 days this will now be 7 x 4  28 days later by 15sept nothing happened except that bt changed my landline number to a new random number despite having told me in writing that they would keep it upon calling them on 16sept and asking for an explanation they told me that this was due to a system error in their bt openreach exchange and they apologized terribly and profoundly for this and they promised to correct the error in three days time by 18sept on 18sept bt changed my landline number to a another new random number but did not give me back my old number which i had had for 15 years upon calling them they apologized terribly and profoundly  told me that this time they would correct the problem in three days time by 21sept they also explained that my old number had not been restored because the first customer adviser did not know and did not follow the correct procedure for requesting the restoration of the number  but that this time they knew the procedure and they would follow it faithfully three days later  on 21sept bt gave me yet a third random number but not my old number when i called them they apologized terribly and profoundly and told me that they would correct the problem in another three days time by 24sept they also explained that the second customer adviser did not know and did not follow the correct procedure for requesting the restoration of my number  but that on this third time they knew the procedure and they would follow it faithfully another three days later on 24sept bt gave me yet another new random number but did not restore my old number i called them again and they again apologized terribly and profoundly and promised well  by now you know the story  it was repeated no less than three more times before bt at long last managed to restore my old number which i had had for 15 years and which they had changed without my consent long story short  today is 18oct2016 and i still do not have any internet  neither bt tv nor bt sports they are now promising that they would start providing services soon should i believe them i should i call and tell them that i want to leave bt on grounds that for 63 days bt managed only to change my landline number to several random numbers but have not managed to start

online bt live chat where i had been talking to technicians about my issues  and how to solve them the problem was  the technicians were constantly closing the chat and ending the conversation before i got anywhere eventually i get through to someone decent and have an engineer booked for the 22nd  which is great but the engineer comes out and finds nothing wrong with the internet in the house  and tells us to ring up bt and tell them this we report this to bt and they tell us they will have higherups look at the problem to try sort it out  after waiting two days they tell us when they are going to ring  but it is a time we cannot do but we cannot rearrange the call because texting is going to charge us money so  we try to be free around the time  but cannot get to the phone after they ring twice and tell us they will ring the next day this time we can be at the phone  so on the call  he tells us that the technicians are still looking into the problem eventually  they agree to send out another technician and on the 30th of may  from 1pm  6pm they completely just miss this appointment and do not inform us of why we then get a ring the next day to rebook the appointment on the 2nd of june  the engineer then comes in and finds three different faults with the hardware in the home which i dont know how the first engineer didnt findso  after this terrible experience for a service we are currently paying for £70 a month for  and it not being usable for more than half the month  bt ring up to discuss compensation and offer £14 for the fault and another £5 on top as a goodwill

the broadband and i had to keep my old hub which is 5 years old caller seemed to think the cost compared with plusnet was down to spead so if you have to wait a couple of seconds more for a £12 saving thats no problem plus some benifits including a price freeze over the term of the contract surly if you are in contract thats the price you pay over the term of the contract obviously not as i was

for what i thought was a better deal and had a 3 month nightmare as the connection failed every few days for 1 or more days and i spent hours on the phone while they tested the line only to conclude every time that there was a problem at my property and they would have to send an engineer out when the engineer came he could find no problem  but more often than not the service resumed again and they said there was a problem at the exchange which they had just fixed they sent me a new router after one call saying the problem was with that but it was not meantime when the service was working the download speed was always abysmal  which they said was because it was over the phone line and 3 miles from the exchange  but i countered that with sky i had 2 years of good bandwidth as well as zero service interruption after 3 months i got them to agree that the service was inadequate and i am currently exiting the 2 year £30 per month contract with them to go back to sky  which will cost me £35 for broadband and tv interestingly bt are also playing a game in these contracts where they say up to a certain speed but when the service is crap they say that contractually there is no minimum bandwidth agreement they could have held me to contract on that basis but as it happened i also had the zero service days  which they couldnt duck out of in my opinion you should avoid bt  and in my case it was only the hotspot nearby that kept me connected most of the time at all  though that service itself would come and go luckily i was not working from home otherwise it would have been very difficult and i would have spent a lot of money getting data through my mobile provider bt never again thanks', 'hi everyone  i signed up to bt fibre broadband in august 2017 in what otherwise seemed a smooth transfer which took just over 2 weeks to complete  a very good sign youd say within two weeks after the service started  i started experiencing drops in connection every evening with router blinking amber  fluctuating connection speed and juddering videogaming so i reported my fault with bt helpline which is based overseas  so often understanding them was an issue in itself and the saga began instead of calling an engineer  bt kept resetting my router and sending me helpful tips how to make my broadband better  which worked for probably 30 mins  sometimes even less having called them for approximately 20 times and each call was taking no less than 30 minutes  i finally managed to convince the customer service representative to call the engineer  guess what  she never called one in  although it was promised later on  i was promised a wifi booster and a 15m cable to rectify the issues  they have never been sent to me i was also promised that i will receive refund for these months when i had no quality connection finally  in the end dec 2017  fed up with nonexistent quality and constantly dropping connection i threatened to leave  at which point bt customer service managed to call the engineer in who came in around 7th of january and identified the problem with the bt exchange  after which the connection was okay  albeit not perfect a couple of days ago i called bt and asked whether they refunded me for three months of no connection and my pain and time spent on the phone with them  i reckon about 25 hours by that time in response  i was told that they could give me £10 as a goodwill gesture as they apparently cannot refund monthly fees past 120 days over past 10 years or so ive been a customer of o2  sky and plusnet  but at no point i had such a dreadful combination of poor connection  incompetent customer service and false promises i will be taking this to the ombudsman to make sure this experience is heard and appropriate action is taken my takeaway is  if you keen to spend hours of your precious time on the phone and get no result  sign up to bt broadband otherwise steer clear', 'i have to re start several times each day as the system cuts outstreaming services are often a challenge  the picture either freezes or cuts outas an old loyal customer i cannot access the cheaper offers aimed at new customersif i want to alter my

related to money they over charge their customer without letting them know  they should understand people are not free to phone them up frequently asking foe explanations and reporting problems last week i phoned them many times reporting problems and overcharging they are a big lair  they told me that the engineer will come on saturday to fix the problem  i was waiting him all the day  but he did not come  when i phoned them  they said he came on friday and he fixed the problem  but actually i have not noticed any improvement  i gave them few weeks time  but it still as it was  when i

for 5 years their service was alright as long as you paid them when i tried leaving them they threatened me with a £400 fine i pleaded with them saying that the only reason i am leaving them is because their internet broadband is very slow in my new property after i moved house they refused to listen they constantly threaten over the phone i have now opened a case with the ombudsman i have learnt that it takes 8 weeks before ombudsman opens a case against bt so i am patiently waiting without giving up i have since moved to virgin and their internet connection is so fast wish i had moved

called bt i get a foreign call centre and have a lot of trouble understanding what they are saying they take me through troubleshooting steps  which i know and memorised when they get to the end of the steps they advise me about sending an engineer out at a cost of around £100 if the fault is that of my own i have since started a new broadband contract with sky who i know arent the greatest  but surely cannot be worse i have managed to reduce my monthly combined bill of tvbroadband by almost £50 per month i am so fed up of bt overpriced  overhyped and just plain thieves', 'bt fitted a new

fine apparently is sudden 8mb drop on my connection 30% of my total speed is normal and is possibly down to  and i quote more people connecting now my old connection had a slightly better ping and would sync at 25mb ive moved to bt and everything is worse i couldnt recommend against them enough', 'good but now flawed i like bt and have had much better speeds than when i was with sky however  recently when ive needed help i have been treated very badly by customer services i dont like being spoken to as though i was an idiot when my contract runs out i will be looking to change providers', 'with a speed of 048mbps how can this be viewed as broadband   i was achieving similar speed using dial up many years ago but am now charged significantly more   the use of the term up to speed is a con   the only comment i can make on reliability is that the lights on the hub flash regularly and i lose my connection  such as it is  so at least bt should be able to claim that that at least is reliable', 'failed promises from day one i was told my servcies was going to start 3rd of december then they kept pushing it back uptill 15th of december as a new customer its impossible to speak to any one so cancelled afer reading preious reviews', 'this is the worst provider ive ever been with  and ive been with aol  they promise me 7meg and im getting just about 2 not worth £30pm', 'just poor on all counts  £50 cancellation fee even though out of contract', 'bt are shocking no two ways about it i have used them in multiple contexts and now i have myself a dilemma ive moved house temporarily and work from home routinely the area i am in is not a virgin media one  who frankly were incredibly good relative to the rest of the market all in i am stuck with basically two suppliers that ill consider  plusnet and bt  bt  when it works  works thats all i have to say on that out of the fibre providers who are not virgin media the service is often faultless  but not often enough the thing that is stopping me signing up personally again is that i know that if something goes wrong  there will be absolutely no way of fixing it  i dont know what dimension bt work in  but their customer services couldnt be more useless additionally  logging a ticket just means the ticket disappears altogether you will never get a resolution to any issue that you find and youll not be able to cancel so imaging signing up to an 18 month contract and 20 days in  find it stopped working as the traffic has reshaped so that you are now not getting the 76mbps but nearer  say  3mbps youre basically done for  you cant cool off the cool off period for bt seems to be different to everyone else  since they cant seemingly install inside that 14 day time period and with shaping  it takes time to get to your final speed potentially more than 14 days so what you pay for  you wont get and unlike other providers out there  there will be no resolution for it  other than to go to the communications ombudsman or make a complaint to ofcom  tickets getting lost has happened to me in commercial environments so id be loathed to take a hit personally on this i was previously with virgin media relative to the rest of the market  virgin media are head and shoulders above the rest i cant describe how much i miss that service now bear in mind the rest of the providers on the market run on bts network  even if theyve been sold some percentage of racks in an exchange  its still bts infrastructure this is one of the reasons that they are also poor in a way some of it is entirely out of their control the question then becomes how well other providers can make their value adds work', 'bt were a good company 10 years ago now they cut you off at random as a result of not carrying out work they promise has been done if you try to speak to someone presumably to save money at no interest to their customers you wait on automatic answerphones for 20 minutes  to get disgruntled staff who keep you waiting 20 minutes sorting the problem out  just co cut you off do you have to start again etc etc you can never get continuity with one contact  and none of them seem to have any clue what their colleagues have said or done without doubt the worst communications organisation i have come across they cant even communicate with themselves to big   absolutely disinterested in their customers total lack of management organisation their adverts of how good they are and how they care about customers are perhaps the greatest work of fiction ever created', 'looks at the stars enough said ', 'where to start i joined bt from sky around 2 months ago due to my mum having infinity and her speeds being great first when the broadband is working its good not great but good my room and the kids room get very poor strength which wasnt a problem when i was with sky now the big problem the reliability of the connection despite having their latest hub the 5 my broadband drops around 1015 times a day which when your sons are gaming and your tv service is dependant on the internet is a huge problem so far apart from being spoken to like a simpleton schoolboy theyve done nothing to address the issue so after reading all these other terrible reviews ive decided to try virgin they can simply chase me for what theyll say i owe im not paying for a service that is of a far below par qualityso after writing this ill contact virgin and see if they can offer a more reliable service avoid bt at all costs', 'i was charged £130 for a new line even though i had an active line their

however my biggest gripe is with their reliability of both the broadband service and their router hardware the homehub 3 is a shocker it basically loses connected devices  causes resolving host issues constantly and needs restarting more frquently than a delorean then you try customer service and they want to sell you a new oneto replace the naff one they provided added to which  they want to send an engineer over who is basically there to find any reason he can to say its not their fault and charge £80 for the pleasure of doing you over really bad really really bad', 'i have been with bt for over 3 years went with them because they claim to have the most reliable internet connection this is not the case they have one of  if not the worst internet reliabity i have ever experienced what annoys me more is the speed and the price there lack of customer service to long standing existing customers is disgusting i have rang them on numerous times to discuss this but they just fob you off and dont even seemed bothered and now they have stooped to new low we have decided to give another provider ago and since our new provider contacted bt to arrange swapping the line etc the internet as become even more slow i am without doubt sure they have slowed my internet further has fingers up to me leaving them how can company the size of bt not be concerned with losing customers who are spending over £500 a year if only i could run my business like that anyway if i was you i would try another provider', 'i dont leave reviews as a rule but have had enough of this terrible service my

weve had broadband that is slow  unreliable and always drops out our previous supplier never had these issues bt are a disgrace avoid at all costs', 'ive been with bt broadband paying for their best  braodband option available infinity 2 its rubbish the smartly advertised speed called up to  explains it all its almost never there customer service is also a joke and process of leaving bt too  it is also a pain in the a they will tray to charge you £30 just for leaving them even if you have served your full contract term they will charge you for everything even for payment processing pretty much like ryanair does  on the top of that i think that bt should be reported to the watch dog and office of fair trading for dishonest advertising  they are advertising that their infinity 2 broadband is a fibre optic broadband which is not truth as its only half fibre optic broadband the only fibre optic cable there is the one that runs from local bt exchange box into your house but all cables running to that local bt exchange box are old copper cables the only uk 100% fibre optic braodband is from virgin bt no thank you ', 'after agreeing that a bt engineer would install a new line and telephone box into my house as part of me joining bt the bt engineer never turned up and i was emailed to say that my service was switched on via an old bt line i had years earlier used for business in my house i contacted bt so they could correct their mistake they denied all knowledge of the agreement  stated tc about general installation and said that to move a box would cost me from £130 £200 the figure varied depending on which department i spoke with not one department could arrange for an engineer to correct their mistake an engineer explained that as they were a different part of bt they couldnt correct faults of other parts of bt in the end i was advised to try again tomorrow when maybe there might be someone who could take responsibility thankfully im still within my 14 day period my advice dont trust them', 'ive used more swear words since using bt moving house service  than ever beforejust when you think they cant get any worse they suprise youthey are very good at charging you for services you didnt have  or didnt want  then charge you again for cancelling them', 'terrible broadband   terrible customer service  do not touch bt they are a disgrace', 'having been with another company for over 25 years i transferred to bt broadband  before doing so i asked and was told that i could ask  if it ever became necessary  to speak to someone whose first language was english  no need to say anymore about that and i have no prejudices its just that im not a qualified english teacher  so after three different contracts i eventually got my equipment  bt admin is a total disaster  things have been going along reasonably smoothly  apart from when they tried to blackmail me into signing up again for 12 months in order to get bt sport  but finally  for some unknown reason i recently received my latest email bill from bt  when i tried to have a look at this  instead of the usual pages coming up i was informed that i would have to register with a new bt id  now my troubles really started  i spent 1 hour and 20 minutes trying to explain to a person whose first language was not english that i was quite content with the system that i had been using for the past 25 years ie outlook express  i asked to speak to the line manager but he was too busy so it was arranged that a person from the next level up would phone me to resolve my problem  this was done and the level 2 agent spent over 20 minutes with the system so that i would continue getting my email via microsoft outlook express  needless to say this hasnt happened  now i can only get my email through the bt server  using a bt email system and already i am getting spam that ive avoided for over 20 years and  into the bargain  im also now getting bt ads for other companies that presumably pay bt for the privilege  bt are a crowd of money making gangsters  dont ever sign up to them', 'i live in weston subedge chipping campden  a relatively affluent cotswold village where the clock has been retarded to victorian times by bt the phone and broadband services  patchy at the best of times  have  since last monday disappeared with no update as to when they will be fixed local businesses  medicalservice dependent pensioners and gcse students cant access vital services there has been no black friday or cyber monday in weston subedge several hundred homes are affected i hear on the jungle drums that bt is unable to fix the problem until 20th december  almost a month without service  today they put bt line rental bills up classic monopoly with rubbish customer service how can we affect their nps affecting their bonuses may be the only way to get them to listen', 'i have bts best for around here  80 mbps  im lucky to be very near the cabinet and i actually get close to that speed  74 to be picky  i did however have some problems in the months following its installation  with speed it would drop by 50% or more every 34 days and required a reset of the router to fix iti noticed that it never dropped below that speed i got fed up and suspected that bt were taking the michael charging me for 80 and supplying 35 lets face it most people wouldnt notice i complained about this and got a phone call telling me the line was fine and the problem was static electricity build up on the router and that i would have to continue to do a reset when speed dropped what sort of modern equipment would be susceptible to that i guess he was reading from a crib sheet however since my complaint a strange thing has happened  not once since  and its more than 6 weeks now  has the speed dropped not once static build up my derriere', 'i have been on bt broadband since 2001 they are now the worst i have had since broadband started today email is down when email is up you have 15 minutes before it times out and you have to re log on i asked the help desk somewhere in england and they said thats it thats how it is going to be at my job we are going to drop bt that includes phone lines i am sure they left yahoo to save money big mistake i would have paid more to stay in it', 'i signed up to bt and i can honestly say i found them a very reputable company there customer service was excellent  very open to reason when it came to a complaint i only left because i found a cheaper package which sadly bt couldnt match at the time sadly not long after i left bt they rang  offered me a cheaper deal than what i was originally paying but i had already paid my up front line rental with my new provider  im hoping the isp im with now will live up to its expectations if not i would gladly return to bt even though it ment i was paying a little more ive read some of the bad reviews bt have received but i can only go on my experience with them  i would personally   recommend them', 'absolutely pathetic the broadband here was never going to be quick but they way the village is treated is unbelievable bt infinity has been put through the village so that the town next to us could use it  but they didnt let us now all of a sudden my internet has dropped down to 130kbs thats disgusting  and bt will do sweet f a about it disgusting company who genuinely dont care as long as they are making a profit', 'appalling i live in a small cottage and cannot get a signal have to reboot on average 6 times per day only been with them since september  biggest mistake cannot leave and change providers as they want to charge me £295 termination fee  even though they are not providing the service i am paying forshocking', 'i have been using bt infinity for a year and a half when i had to move houses i called bt to cancel my contract  the person i talked to told me that there would be a £37 cancellation charge on top of my regular monthly bill after that it all went wrong and bt kept emailing of outstanding bills that kept changing and no one was able to give me an explanation i am overall very disappointed at the end of the day i had to pay what they asked in order for my account to close as it affected my credit score i was harassed to pay a bill that made no sense because i had no choice would definitely not recommend  there are other companies out there that might have problems too but at least half as expensive on the monthly bills', 'have had bt infinity 1 fibre optic broadband for a while now and never had any problems with it  speeds i am getting are comparable with virgin and wifi has been more reliable customer service has been good too when ive had need to raise a query', 'i recently took out bt infinity and although the speed test connections say im getting 35mpd all my devices struggle to open any web pages and streaming is almost impossible i contacted bt about this and they was next to no use telling me that im getting the download speed they say im very disappointed with infinity and will be going back to my standard connection as soon as i can as i found the connection far quicker i would defiantly not recommend bt infinity to anyone', 'the worst company ive had to deal with terrible customer service  terrible broadband speed  terrible reliability  terrible hardware hub 3 router how this monopoly is allowed to get away with this is amazing not only that but they lie almost once a year the phone line  broadband goes down usually for at least a week its always for the same reason crumbling wiring  switchgear in the road outside their own engineers have told me that the repeated problems are because bt wont spend the money to upgrade the 1970s aluminium cabling etc not even copper a few weeks ago it was down for 2 weeks i received almost no information or updates when i repeatedly complained that there was no evidence in the area of any work being done to repair it i was told that the fault was a major problem at the exchange  was affecting a large area  was taking longer to sort out sure enough a van appeared in the road outside our house on the 14th day  within 3 hours it was fixed when i asked about the major problem at the exchange the engineer said he nothing about that  he was just sent to fix a problem in the road outside', 'broadband speed is very slow wanted to upgrade to infinity and ordered and then bt has cancelled my order saying that it is not available in my area then  bt called me again and said infinity is available and i ordered again guess what they cancelled again when i check on their website with my phone number and postcode it says infinity is available as i live in a new development area i had to use this terrible service for ages', 'after recently moving house ive ended up with bt broadband they sent me a home hub which is a dreadful bit of rubbish  have recently reverted back to my old netgear router one of the issues i had with the bt hub is that bt seem to mysteriously do stuff to it remotely  and there is a distinct lack of user configuration tools  unlike the netgear which the user has complete control of  have had major issues with their parental controls stuff i have not enabled this  but every so often a message pops up advising me to switch it on  with no way of dismissing the message and getting back to the site i was accessing i eventually phoned their help desk in india and was treated like an idiot i said i wanted nothing to do with parental controls as there are no children in the house but was told its a government order that all users will be hassled to switch the stuff on in 2014 bt service levels are practically nonexistent with the indian call centres a total joke i keep getting letters from them advising me to move to infinity broadband for more speed but im connected to the rose street exchange which is not fibre enabled  and bt have no plans to do so as they say its not economical for that exchange so in conclusion would avoid bt if that is possible if this parental control issues is not sorted soon im going to ditch bt broadband but either way im stuck with them as they own the copper lines from the exchange sooner or later the government is going to have to bite the bullet and fund a project to rewire the uk and provide fibre to every house', 'absolutely appalling customer service  had ongoing broadband problem for months was told a manager would call me back on 3 different occasions waited in specially only to receive no phone call as promised this is after spending a ridiculous number of hours on the phone to bt and getting absolutely nowhere fed up of their ridiculous repetitive scripts  complete lack of knowledge and utter lack of decent customer service finally taking my business elsewhere', 'bt hate customers spent 3 weeks trying to get an engineer out when i managed to book one he did not turn up waited another week and had a visit and was told it was fixed in this time internet dropping out for days at a time or so slow unusable still not fixed rang call centre again who refused to request another engineer to visit as we were long line ie rural had broadband for many years at this address so why cant they sort it now they dont listen to what you say  just keep repeating the same thing also they gave us the option of cancelling the service without penalty how generous or carry on paying for the few minutes we manage to connect as they are the only providers in the area we have no option but to continue paying a premium price for an appalling service also our neighbours who presumably have the same length of line are able to get reasonable broadband', 'as of today if i do not get any satisfaction from bt i will throw they equipment out of my house below is some of the dealings i had with bt staff from england  scotland  ireland and india and still nothing sorted i would like to invite you to a problem i am having british telecom on the 11 july i place an order for bt to install telephone line  broadband and tv package included with the package i would receive £60 of sainsburys vouchers as i had completed my order on line i then contacted one bt staff on telephone number 0800800150 to confirm my order and told the young man that i wanted to bring my telephone number from virgin media  with me to which he agree i could do that he also said that i did not need to do anything as bt would contact virgin media to close my account and at the same time get the telephone number over from them  he also confirm that there was a bt line at my property and a date was agreed for installation on the 24 july 2014    on the 24th july 2014 two work men arrived and spent sometime trying to find a line into the building eventually their left and said someone would contact  but no one contacted me so i call them a couple of days later ended up speaking to number of people in india who did not have a clue what was going so having made several more calls later i eventually spoke to someone by the name of lauren atkinson in sunderland who was very apologetic and eventually she told me that she would arrange an engineer to come out to me on 31 july 2014 she also promise that she would then call me back in the afternoon of 31 july 2014 to check everything was going alright i also made her aware that i would like to make a formal complaint about the service i was receiving and the cost of many calls i was having to keep to contacting bt on my mobile phone she also agree that i had made several very long calls to each time to india and i would be given back that money  i never got that call she promised  so i rang again and asked for her and excuses were made that she would call me which did not happen  an engineer suddenly turn up on the  30 july 20014 and found the line to the building then left after saying someone will come to run the line into my property another engineer arrived the following week and connect the line in my property and after lots of calls to india once again i finally got my internet connected but it did work for several days and the phone connected on the 10 august 2014  but no email address and i still do not have an email address at the time of writing this email to you on 13 august 2014 i spoke to kiera from scotland who said she was sorry  but no one had contact virginmedia about closing the  account or transfer my telephone number and i would have to do this myself so the following day  i contacted virginmedia who confirm no one has contacted them form bt and that i would have to give 30 days notice kiera did say i could send the bill from virginmedia to bt for them to pay it on saturday  23 august 2014 i rang bt and spoke to alex i explain that i wanted to cancel the order due to it taking so long to complete   but he was very rude and aggressive and said if i cancel i would be made to pay for the full 18 months contract  over the period of time trying to get bt to install all these items in my property i have made hundreds of calls to various people and not one of them have follow through or sorted out the installation or even calling me back when their said there would and you ask for them their never available to speak with me there and always some body new to speak  and the same old apology im sorry im sorry but nothing ever got done i even try telling them their were doing a great job just to get proper service i also was told that i cannot receive my £60 sainsburys voucher or any of my sports apps because i do not have a email address on the 27 august 2014 i rang bt again and spoke to a female who told me her name was colin  customer service from aberdeen she admitted after reading some of my notes that i have been treated pretty badly  but could not tell when i would get my email address she also said i could not cancel on my bases that i believe bt has breach its own contract with me by not completing its installation agreement on the date 24 july 2014 or even now with me it also seems to me that much of bt staff are reading from scripts as every one them will say sorry over 20 times during the conversations  but it means nothing if you are not getting the service you are paying for bt has even have the cheek to start taking payment from account  here are a list of some of the other bt staff

to different people who then give me conflicting diagnosis and advice i would encourage everyone who has similar experience to make a formal complaint  get the reference number and fill in

my computer to them and they ended up telling me exactly what i told them within the first minute i am now paying for a service that i am not getting and bt really dont care i have written a letter to them and still noone has the decency to call me or sort out my problem  absolutely avoid', 'this service is an absolute disgrace customer services  technical faults mislead and lie to you the broadband speed is no way near what was promised and constantly cuts out complete and utter waste of money and they will not even release me from the contract despite not providing what i asked for

boost the line well  i ran all the speed tests and used an ethernet cable for my broad band direct from the socket with a new filter as requested still rubbish they therefore reset the line then it still didnt work i raised it with them on the phone and they advised i wait 20 days still nothing then a call  they blamed it on a wireless problem inspite of the tests showing that that it wasnt  they wen reset the line they then stated they couldnt guarantee wireless speed i raised it with other representatives via twitter and got the same answer in a long and pointless email  the broadband never goes above 35 mbps and is often much less the line constantly drops out watching films and multimedia without interruption is a pipe dream i was promised about 10mbps yesterday my partner was told that nothing was guaranteed and that i had no right to cancel she was told to consult the small print the sooner the ofcom changes come into place allowing me to quit the better i cannot dissuade

them and the line was awesome', 'after waiting in for three seperate engineer appointments i still havent seen an engineer  each missed appointment resulted in me phoning bt to be told a different lie

what the problem was he asked me to monitor the usage for the next couple of days  and advised me how to change my wireless password  which i had long since forgotten then sent me a text message and said to reply to it with a time they could call me if the usage was still high on the monday it had gone up to 2573gb so i sent a text  and someone called me back within 15 mins he said there had been several complaints from customers about higher than usual usage and they were working on a solution he assured me i wouldnt be charged for the excess usage  and sure enough when my bill came yesterday

helfpfulness was mt', 'customer service is shocking  it took four months to finally fix a fault slow service  buffering  losing connection during that time i had to deal with some very rude people who kept talking over me and no compensation when it was finally resolved  the broadband can be excellent but its not worth using because of the hassle if you have to use customer services', 'struggling to describe the quality of bt fibre broadband without the use of swear words total dog crap springs to mind the reliability and speed is shocking  almost from day one i have experienced regular outages in service cant wait for my current contract to end i will never buy into a bt broadband package again', 'just switched to bt broadband few days ago and found that the braoddband speed very slow at times and connection unreliable by replacing the bt home hub router with my netgear dualband router solved all the problems', 'not one day goes buy without having problems with connectivity it takes an age to get speaking to someone and they then get you to test the speed wired  despite repeatedly telling them its with wifi the problem is they told me the equipment i have is no longer used as it is out of date but they wont supply a new hub we have the tv package as well  apart from bt sport its crap had to get netflix not a patch on sky tv', 'initially went on a 9month unlimited broadband package  however the bills always kept coming higher than the set contract price after 9 months  when i called to cancel  i was told that the 9 month contract was only for internet so we had to pay extra cancellation fees for the landline to make matters worse  after cancelling their services they supposedly took 2 weeks to process the cancellation during which i ceased using their services as i had already moved out of the flat yet they sent me a bill charging me for an extra month when i called to investigate  customer services were rude and patronising they said theyd refund me the money by deducting them from my cancellation fee and so the matter was dismissed a week later  when my cancellation bill came through  i found that they had only deducted  £120 from it appalling to say the least i will never be returning to bt again  it was a waste of money and time', 'supper crab service  worst ever we ordered the internet in last february  and got installation until april after many calls when we moved house at the beginning of october  bt changed us 200 pounds for moving  and again took another one and half months for the reinstallation now we can not tolerate the slow speed  and wanted to cancel it  100 pounds for penalty', 'my broadband speed was really poor but when i reported this to bt they sent out an engineer within 2 days and fixed the problem  this was only a few days ago and so i cant really comment on the long term but so far so good  their customer service was excellent', 'broadband very slow to nothing weekends and evenings help line in india also very little help as they seem to read from check list which has nothing to do with this issue', 'i have been with bt for 6 years and i am moving home at the end of june and i read on the internet about giving notice to bt one month before when moving to avoid extra charges on the 9th of june i phoned bt asking to stop my contract at the end of the month i confimed twice with the customer service saying i was moving out on the 30th and i needed the landline till that day  he assured it was ok and i wrote everything down i immediately received an email saying i was getting disconnected the day after so i promptly called back saying i didnt want to be disconnected the day after  they said there was nothing to do and the disconnection was on the way and there was nothing to do about iti begged to keep my connection as i need internet for work they ammitted their fault but they said there was nothing they could do the day after i got disconnected by bt and that was my landline and broadband gone i called bt several times and they said i would have been reconnected the day after  3 different people assured me i was going to be reconnected  but nothing happened after 2 days i called back and they told me i would have to wait for the following week to be reconnectedafter that call i received an email saying i was subscribing a new 12 months contract and the reconnection fee was 50 pounds  i never asked any of that when the week after i finally got reconnected the internet wasnt working and i put up with being with no internet for 20 days waiting to move out i just gave up talking to them a special mention goes to the customer service department  all they do is asking your details asking to hold on while they check transferring your call to someone else asking your details again since the new speaker doesnt know anything about you asking you to hold on again while they check transferring you again or lying and saying everything is ok they have been lying to me so much about everything  the timing  fees  procedures  speaking to customer service is pointless or actually bad for you because they create troubles instead of sorting them out conclusion if you speak to bt the only communication you should aknowledge is the written one you receive by post or emaileverything said on the phone is unreliable if you want to cancel bt  just tell them the day before  they dont need any notice  they will charge you anyway 43 pounds for the disconnection  unless you cancel at the end of your 12 months contract if you can  avoid bt at all costs', 'my review of bt is that bt is the worst internet weve ever had at my home i got told that ill be happy with this internet speed so i can still be happy in making my games with a fast

to get a phone call from the engineer saying he was on his way apparently the lines coming into my house were the wrong type for infinity 2 once he sorted the setup  the internet speed hadnt improved  so after visiting the junction box  he informed me that there were manhole repairs to be performed ive had my bt contract for over 6 months and paying for the infinity 2 service  but didnt have the correct setup coming into my house i keep getting passed from pillar to post the customer services staff agree with all you say  but nothing actually gets done to solve the problem im getting to the point i want to wring someones neck  but there is no one there with responsibility i am sooooo frustrated', 'we changed from sky to bt biggest mistake half the equipt didnt turn up in time  so 2

least 15 minutes to get to talk to someone who doesnt know the answer to your problem  the problem is its a new built and bt provided the router system so no other providers can set up the broadband

connection would drop and not connect again i had to get 3 bt engineers out which all said there was nothing wrong even when they saw the problem happening this resulted in my diagnosing the issue myself and actually fixing it myself the came a time which now my bt vision box doesnt work  my recordings fail or my chanels get pixelated broadband and aerial are fine which all points to the box bt would not swap this out for me but sent an engineer out who was 2 hours late and all he did was a rest on the box the following dady i checked and it still wasnt working so going back to bt they not expect me to run all these checks again the customer service and engineers are useless so dont waste your money on this company go for a better one where you will get the service you pay for', 'as a

is based when i informed them of my lack of service they informed me it would be fixed within 48 hours now 72 hours later i rang them back where i was told it will not be fixed for another 4 days this means from initially starting my contract with bt it will of been 3 weeks before i have the chance of internet the customer service is shoddy and british telecom seem to have no interest in the british customer appaling', 'dont use this company miss selling is rife think of the worst double glazing company and x it by 10 we were missed sold the package by a telephone sales rep he promised 4 times faster connection then our existing sky broadband  and that we could connect 7 wireless devices well we are sitting here with less then 1 meg and unable to connect any devices wirelessly it took over 1 hour to down load a film on sky bt take no responsibility for the false promises made and completely disregard the fact that there representative lied and missed sold we are now left stuck in

past 2 months the amount of dropping out that is going on is so bad that i am now losing money because of the constant unreliability issues of bt infinity i have had an engineer visit my property on 3 occasions in the past month only to tell me i have nothing wrong with my internet connection  etc  etc however  the person i am dealing with at bt agrees that i have issues as he has been monitoring it  but apparently he unable to advice on whether i can get out of my contract in order to go to sky fibre without a massive charge from bt for the remainder of my contract  even though that bt are in breach of their own terms  i am unable to get out of the contract  even if the person at bt who has been monitoring the issues agrees that i have issues with my broadband  but they are unable to rectify those issues by simply allowing me to get out of my contract so he admits i have these problems and they are not honoring their own service contract  but i am unable to get out of it  ha ha  awful company that insults my intelligence and i am sure many other peoples intelligence  they are a joke of a communications company  and my telephone and broadband spend is annually around £2000  well they can f off because that business on the two lines i have in my house  including my home office and broadband are all going to sky as soon as i can get away from bt the way they have handled this problem has been just utterly stressful and inept the loss of money i have had due to one specific day where the router crashed 14 times  yes 14 times in an afternoon was just stressful and completely unacceptable  i am going to seek legal advice on how to force bt to let me out of the contract and also seek substantial damages for the loss of £ due to the unreliability of their inept infinity service   i will also add  that bt throttle the network everyone i know this from a friend of mine who just happens to be a bt engineer who has worked for bt for 20 years  has basically spilled the beans as to why i really have issues with my broadband and why so many bt customers have issues  it is because they throttle the network to boost other areas of the network obviously this is completely illegal and bt are walking on really thin ice i have had enough of bt  the stress of dealing with them  they are the most inept company that i have ever dealt with i am going to sue them for damages and i am going to go public with my findings about how they throttle the network  bt made the wrong move by aggravating me  now it is my turn to cause them stress and embarrassment along the way 110 for bt in general sky offer a far superior service  they may not be the fastest  but they are more reliable and far cheaper to use virgin like bt are inept as well from what i understand  and they too have been from what i hear been throttling the network  completely illegal  and i hope they get massively fined for it one day and taught a lesson', 'speed to low   lost conection every day   not happy   they dont do anythinghard to talk long waiting time    when talk nothing happens ', 'the great bt con we went with bt because they promised a reliable service oh what a mistake 6 mths down the line we find ourselves trapped with a shambolic result promised with a minimum of 3mb  which is still pathetic and a promise of a get out if it fails our average for the past month is 79 yet because it reaches 3 at least once a week they want £ 180 to terminate the contract  con being the operative par our neighbour has managed to sort them out but only after legal action and we dont have that sort of cash to throw away meanwhile we are stuck with helplines that dont speak english and a useless service warning stay away from bt', 'save your moneyfor a communications company they

requested a landline and internet installation at our houseboat  thats a whole other sorry talethe speeds are rubbish  the connection constantly drops out and streaming is uselessaccording to bt there is no problem  and they have suggested lots of technical things we could do to try to improve connection and speeds  as well as things like not having more than 1 device connected  moving the modem

knowledgeable nor are we engineers  so the technical suggestions they have made might as well have been in chinese  all we want is to be able to switch on  watch to moviessports and check e nails browse the web and download books and music  i dont believe any of these things place huge demand on the poor old broadband  but it seems they completely overtax it i have moved all electrical apparatus away although the tv is kind of integral to the package i draw the line at knocking down walls  and majority of the time im sat no more than 10 feet from the router i had the installation done by their engineers  but despite this its still rubbishwish we could get virgin in our area  but for now looks like i will have to go back to sky and their slow expensive but reliable service

is the norm and a bloke answered  kept me on hold for 10 mins to speak to someone who may help me but put me through to another department without saying anything  guess what another 10 mins on hold then a very unhelpful lady from india said the reason i had not got the broadband was the order i put in hadnt gone through and that it was my fault   so i queried why i had been given a date and why someone had called me to check the line number was correct to which she said i have cancelled your order and you will have to go back on again and carry out another order so i replied you have been most unhelpful  thank you very much for cancelling the order you have saved me some time goodbye', 'we moved over to bt infinity having been promised wonderful connection throughout the house  they lied  we can only get broadband in the room where the hub is situated   i caught my husband sobbing when he realised that if i wanted to be on the computer in the study then he couldnt watch tv

as the external work hasnt been done bt customer services said they would still be cutting me off tomorrow for an undetermined length of time the engineer would give a report within 2 weeks i told them i am a gp and work from home out of hours telephone triage for emergencies they said it made no difference i said it was entirely their error why cant they stop the cut off  they said its at the stage of no retur i asked to speak to a manager and am awaiting the call back i am gobsmacked at the appauling service entirely their error but absolutley no acknowlegement and no concern for my livelihood nor patients lives plus they have taken £7411 out of my account without having provided the service and still want to cut me off i phoned fleur telecom who were brilliant as usual they have put a stop on any hand over to bt for tomorrow so hopefully that will work i will be cancelling the fibre broadband package with bt even though its over the cooling off period so no doubt they will

apologetic i genuinely believe they are  but as for the company  they dont give a monkeys every time it rains the service disconnects  you cannot imagine the frustration experienced when i lose my work online or my children lose their homework and have to complete again as the the internet cuts out with such regularity in may this year i made yet another complaint and was advised to upgrade to

big communication barrier no pun intended being scottish and hearing impaired it was and is very difficult to communicate in ordinary conversation  add someone from bangladesh and you have yourself a

the exchange  and so i began taking screenshots to prove that bt knew they were selling me services they could not provide two weeks ago i wrote to the ombudsman  i provided them a brief history of my experience and the continued issues and they agreed to look into it i have heard every excuse in the book but when ollie called me this week from bts british complaint resolution department he told me that the reason for my connection problems was because of my tv ariel to say i was flabbergasted is an understatement  i asked ollie if he was having a laugh  obviously not i then told him i have not got a tv and havent had one for 14 years and that my ariel was cut prior to my moving into my home  7 years ago nonetheless he sent an engineer out for three days later  and when i relayed what ollie stated he burst out laughing  told me that he was taking the pi and he set about installation of a new line and made sure in was connected prior to leaving  low and behold  i still have a poor to non existing connection  best part is ollie telling me he would recommend an ariel installation company for me free of charge today i received a message from the telecommunications ombudsman to say they are doing a thorough investigation into bt and my complaints and will update me as soon as they have completed it nonetheless btbare still charging me despite agreeing to stop taking money from my

me in tears at the lack of understanding  the sheer frustration at giving them almost two years of time to find a resolution and it has been to my detriment on the plus side there is a service checker

chat and was told that my services would activate in 24 hours it did not i contacted their online chat again and was told it would definitely activate by 311 needless to say  i contacted them on the day to make sure the lady on the phone was called sonia it was lucky i called as was told if i hadnt it was unlikely anything would have been done that day either she escalated my complaint for me and made sure they activated my phone line for me that day the broadband activated the following day i would really like to thank sonia as without her  i would probably still be without phone or broadband

had to chase them every step of the way to find out what was happening with my order  i did not like that they would call me for two seconds and hang up before i could pick up just so that they can put down that they tried to call me but could not i did not like that they kept giving me a date then changing it further and further into the future there are some very dishonest people working there  letting down the company and the people who actually work hard there bt comes across as a very disorganised company to me their broadband seems ok right now  but i am dreading having any problems in

despite emails from bt for our new system saying an engineer will arrive to set us and and hsow us how it all works we have never seen an engineer  and we dont work  i should have checked the reviews before  moving  but then the other providers out source to bt anyway  so a hopeless situation  be warned keep to a mobile if your not a business and keep well away from bt if you are  they are too big

as a landline for 30 years never had an issue and always sang their praises to all my friends  etc but when they sent me the hub5  they asked me to return the hub3 to them for recycling  which i then did but after about 3 months orso  the hub started doing random things  such as switching off randomly and more than anything  giving me the worst wifi signal ever so i called bt and said here must be a fault with my service so they ran tests  i checked all my settings and everything from my side was all ok  so they sent me another hub5 and i sent the old one back i received the new hub5  but pretty much had wifi issues since day1 i cant get signal in the next room and its a normal house with normal walls i live in if im on my phone and walk to the kitchen  the signal drops and im stuck on 4g i thought it might be my phone  but its doing the same on my wifes phone and my work mobile  all 3 mobiles are on different providers my laptop and tablet do the same  they drop signal if i move away from the room where the router is i again checked everything in my house  but i dont have any interferences  as i dont have a wireless landline  i dont have any blockers anywhere near my rooms ie microwave or special remote controls etc so i bought a bt wifi extender for the other side of my house  but it never gets connection as it just cannot find the router at all  i know if works as it works fine when plugged into the main room with the router so i contacted bt and told the hub5 they sent me also doesnt work and i asked if they can just not send me the hub6  as my friends use it and they and me when i visit have amazing signal even long into their garden bt then literally told me they wont do anything as i should not be using wifi enabled items as they will never offer assistance with wifi  the lady even told me that their adverts are rubbish and lie i recorded the call so i said could they send me he hub6 because all the issues ive had and ive been with them for such a long time and they said  not a chance if i wanted it  i could buy it but they wouldnt help me their actual words so i feel disgusted by their services and just plain rudeness of their staff im still contracted with them for another 5 months  but really dont want to keep paying for a service i cannot use as its bleep and a drain on my money and resources in the house i would get another router  but bt have made it so difficult for this to happen  as they lock a lot of features to prevent this i know its only the internet  but i make my living from it and cannot do my job correctly without it and its stressing me out  ive already lost a customer because of lack of service ive been able to test a friends hub6 while they were on holiday and the signal was amazing throughout my house and into my garden so this proves that the issue is 100% the hub5 and not my house or area itself but bt are basicly calling me liar and do not care about us at all my contract doesnt finish until the 5th of april so i have to endur this rubbish for a while yet i have raised a claim with the ombudsman for help  as its ridiculous im so unhappy with bt', 'if youre looking to sign up to bt infinity  dont waste your time or money it is absolutely shocking how poor the connections actually are i get better results from my mobile data which is pretty shabby in itself all the new customer deals that they keep chucking out there seem very tempting but save yourself the soul crushing frustration and run  run far away from the decision to enter into a contract which the devil himself must have drawn up because being tied to bt is purely torturous i can honestly say  dial up was betterif i could give 0 stars  i would', 'avoid bt like the plague and certainly do not upgrade to infinity this is the first time i have been compelled to write  review i am shocked and deeply concerned by the number of bad reviews bt are receiving at the moment  it doesnt give me hope my problems are going to be solved anytime soon we were on the dialup broadband for 18months  then decided to upgrade to infinity 1 with a special extra £1 offer however i wish i could turn back the clock and return to my old hub and package we never had any problems before  speeds were ok and it never lost connection infinity 1 has been problems from day one speeds are shocklingly bad it is constantly throwing us off the first month the speeds never got past 4mbps  and were 02mbps past 7pm at night i complained and they found a fault with the exchange the speeds improved temporarily and could reach 2530mbps should be getting at least 46mbps mindhowever 3 weeks on it is repeatly disconnecting us we are forever restarting the hub or disconnecting reconnecting to the wifi on the laptop just done a speed test and it was 8mbps 805pm at night it is so frustrating the customer service is pretty shocking too  and it takes 10mins just to find a contact number on their website in the first instance if you are not a bt customer  do not become one', 'i never normally leave reviews but thought i must this time to warn everyone do not buy bt broadband or tv i have never dealt with people that are so uneducated and basically do not have a clue what products they sell broadband has not work properly since we have had it installed  they tell you that you have a 14 day cooling off period where you can cancel your package if you are not happy what they do not tell you is that this 14 days starts from when you place your order so in my case it took them 3 weeks for an engineer to come out and get it all set up on which case my right to cancel no longer exhausts and want £900 to get me out of my 12 month contact after spending hours and hours getting through to someone on their customer services department i get through to india where they are reading from a screen and dont understand your problem  computer says nooooo i actually emailed them and now have a dedicated person who likes to call every week to see how we are getting on but not actually solving our problemthey have determined that my broadband doesnt work correctly because of where the engineer has set it up  basically on my tv stand they have said connection problems is our fault and nothing they can do  but the broadband needs to be by our tv as it needs to be connected to our youview box funny how sky do not have the same problems as bt but dont worry they are refunding me £1160 as a good will gesture my direct debit is now cancelled see how far they can take it for me to pay my bill when they have falsely advertised their services and have not resolved my problem if you buy something from the shop that is broken you expect a full refund something bt do not understand', 'money grabbing is all they are good for poor speed  connection always disconnecting and tv programs buffer due to premium programs coming through the internet at poor speeds to top it off when my contract finished and told them i was going to

sending the engineer round to install the broadband and tv on the wrong date on 3 separate occasions when they finally got the date correct the engineer wasnt given the correct equipment to install the service i had ordered this was topped off by them charging me for the 3 months between when i put the order in for the service and when it was finally installed and i was able to use it this is something others i have spoken with have also been a victim of so be aware they should only be charging you for the time in which you have use of the services once up and running the internet was slow and this also impacted their tv service as most of this runs off the internet i was paying for infinity 2 which they say will be up to 75mbps and a minimum of 35mbps in my area  however when i finally got round to testing the speed i was receiving 1mbps this has now finally been fixed after a month with many  many calls to their customer service line and two engineer visits  one of which was sent on the wrong day again luckily i was in on this occasion the engineers are great and the second one has fixed the problem and it is now working correctly however the people in the call centre never call back when they say they will and when you call them they tell you you have to wait for a call back from the person dealing with your complaint so they just book in another time slot for them not to call you back in again  be careful to make a note of any calls you make and any engineer appointments you make and keep it as when i spoke with them about compensation the date they gave for the fault being resolved was 10 days before the engineer had been round to fix the problem after all of this they said that if i wanted to leave the contract i would have to buy myself out even though they havent provided the service i had signed up for  i will never be using bt again and i would strongly recommend you consider another provider', 'phoned to cancel old contract the sales guys crib

month late after having to call them on a daily basis to follow up call backs that never happened  after a month and 15 hrs plus on the phone they managed to fix the issue a few weeks later i recieved my first bill which should have just been the delivery charge fr the router  instead i was charged £81 my plan is only meant to be £30 because another mistake that they have made i am still in the process of chasing my money after this horrible experience i will be leaving as soon as my contract ends and not coming back', 'i wouldnt even give a star for the overall service i have been with bt since beginning of september it was the worst mistake going with this provider i tried to save a little money as sky was out my price range for the speed i needed i have the 52 mbs but the actual top speed i can get is 33 mbs being told this from the bt technician that came to my home since my package started i have not had a fully functioning service for longer than 3 days they still have not fixed my problem as i believe they do not know what it actually is with a technician testing everything within my house i and every thing is fine and working other than the service bt provide each time i have phoned bt around 15 times no matter the time of the day i have an average wait time of about 40 mins and when i do speak to someone i believe there is a culture clash as there is no empathy or even a generally recognition of social companionship i have tried to leave the contract due to their speed guarantee but they have fobbed me off with so much and it seems i am stuck in the contract as i can not deal with the extreme hassle of fighting them please do not make the mistake and be wise', 'worst broadband company ever  internet constantly have issues with speed dropping and no service at all sometimes  phone customer service only for them to lie to you and say they will send someone to fix the problem only for noone to turn up i would not be renewing my contract and the only recommendation i would give is avoid at all costs', 'i was told my broadband would be on on the 21st of october it never happened phoned on monday to say it was cancelled  and was told thursday thursday came no broadband phoned again was told the 8th of november so told them to cancel then after much persistent promises to put it on next day i said ok only for next day to be told no its 8th of november so after been put through to the complaints dept twice and cut off i cancelled i was promised compensation but no one phoned regarding this which was told they would i have lost loads of

changed£63 for the month i never even had any internet or tv wouldnt recommend to anybody they are a joke and i wont be staying with them tryed to charge me saying it was a fault in my property when in actual fact it was poorly connected at the main box  they did nothing to try to resolve the situation and later basically called me a liar saying i had not called as it wasnt on there system worst company i have ever been with', 'a four day customer please excuse the saracsim  its a healthier way to express my anger than shouting at their disinterested staff this is an email i have just sent there complaint department not holding my breath please send this to the relevant manager that manager until someone notices how the company operates with a four day customer and can come together with a resolution and a way of insuring this no longer happens with any of your new customers  good afternoon    i decided to become a bt customer regarding bt infinity broadband a few weeks ago my activation date was the 25th october 2016 the day before bt sent me an sms message advising me  my service will start tomorrow 25102016 anytime up until midnight  upon returning home from work  my bt home hub 6 was there and i decided to set it up in case i was already activated seeing there was a solid orange light connection issue i thought i would leave it however i did notice my internet with ee had already finished as i thought would happen  come midnight it was still solid orange  i disconnected the home hub  left it 10 minutes  and reconnected it unfortunately with the same result solid orange light i thought since it was now early hours of the morning i would sleep and see if i was connected in the morning  when waking on the 26th october it was still solid orange  i disconnected the device including the adsl and reconnected after a few minutes  solid orange still coming back from work it was still solid orange in colour  so i decided to run a diagnostic test via my pc it advised me after there was a connection issue and to call your service  after multiple calls your phone back service doesnt like my mobile number and a 36 minute wait i managed to reach an advisor i explained the above issue and provided my details they placed me on hold so they could speak to the order management team i agreed to wait 14 minutes i spoke to a gentleman no name provided presumably from order management team who confirmed my go live date of 25th october 2016 and then asked if he could place me on hold 5 mins he came back to me to advise he needed to speak to bt open reach and asks if i was ok to wait again 3 minutes he came to advise he was talking to open reach and will call me with 5 to 10 minutes call length 1 hour 17 minutes he called me back within 3 minutes the advisor told me that due to a disagreement between bt yourselves and bt open reach a separate contractor now  no engineer had come to my area at all to connect the internet as well as this they would not be able to provide me a timescale in which this would be happening and a service could start we agreed on compensating me for the delivery charge of the home hub as right now its a plastic box with some lighting and a bunch of wires with no other use  plus no charges for the days i did not receive the service understandably im not paying for something i am not receiving we also agreed i would receive a call back the next day between 0800 and 1800  as well as notes being added to the account regarding the above issues within your company causing a delay in a new customer receiving a service  the next day came 27th october 2016  and i received no phone call so come 1810 i called yourselves i requested a call back it still does not like my number  so i put down my partners i received a call back 1 hour later i spoke to a very helpful gentleman called corey i advised him at the beginning of the call i wasnt happy and told him that in a sec i will rant about the service i have received i surprisingly did not swear he was ok with this and during my rant could hear him taking notes made me feel i was being listened too he advised me he has requested a call back to me by 2100 that evening but in case they didnt call  supplied a 5 digit text which i could text if i didnt get a call so they could chase this up  unfortunately again  i did not receive a call back that night  the next day 28th october i text coreys team as advised and i received a call within an hour  the call advisor told me that they have looked into the problem du to an issue with bt open reach i was not going to receive my service until at least the 1st november i advised your college that in the last 48 hours  i have spent 3 hours on the phone  including 1 hour listening to hold music and an automated message its worse than what i imagine water torture to be like and a further 26 hours waiting for a call back your company name is bt  british telecoms  and you cant even provide a call back  thats either disgraceful or a serious problem you need to fix i asked to speak with a manager  the advisor agreed to this and placed me on hold again whilst on hold please get more than one song and mix up your automated ladies voice for a bit of variation  maybe jigsaw from the horror franchise saw for accuracy reflecting your ability to help your customers and then they just hung up on me  i instantly text coreys team advising all this and received a text to say they are speaking to engineering and would call me within 10 minutes it took 4 hours and 30 minutes  to receive a text saying a new department would call me within 45 days and they had closed my case naturally i responded asking for a manager from a relevant department to call me and that i was disgusted at the service i received a call back from a call advisor to tell me they were transferring me to a new department connection department who would transfer me to a manager when i got through i was told i would now not receive an update until the 2nd november  within 10 minutes another day had been added i asked to speak to a manager and was flat out refused i then demanded a call back from a manager  the regulator details for yourselves  and an email address so i could send this message i was advised they couldnt tell me who the regulator was  they couldnt give me an email address but should go to btcom for an email dont think thats going to help and finally i would receive a call back within 23 hours however the fact in 24 hours ive been promised 4 call backs i think its 5 but im too disgusted with this service now to count  and finally when i said i wanted to speak to the manager the advisor disconnected the call a i wasnt even given a warning again for a second disconnection b i wasnt abusive  swearing  personal or direct with my understandable and justifiable anger  also when i asked to speak to your complaints department your colleague refused saying there was no need as there is an open complaint and just kept refusing what is that about please can someone from a managerial position contact me before you close today from a relevant department to discuss and rectify this matter with a professional reason  such as an actual reason  not supplier bt open reach difficulties i have now been more than patient with the level of service or none not coreys team  who have been fantastic if that manager cannot be bothered to deal with me regarding this issue then by veto i want it raised to there manager and so forth until this issue has been fully rectified and i have been compensated for the above issues  an exceptionally disgusted and outraged i dont even know if im even being considered a customercustomer', 'utterly useless for over a year weve been getting in touch with bt to

to do is move our account across because we still have time on the contract so until that point we cant switch to another provider but trying to get bt to do this has been an absolute farce when we finally got a date just to have the line connected and booked time off work to do this they then changed the date to a later date this means we have to rearrange with work and also means well be

that i was paying £40 a month for an adsl line on a separate bill i was being charged £240 a year for the line rental meanwhile my internet connection kept dropping off  so i decided to take the plunge an upgrade to bts superfast fibre you would think that as an exiting customer with a working bt landline that might be a simple enough process ring up  choose a package  pay for ityou must be joking i was on the phone to bt for a total of 99 minutes that dayafter some discussion as to what i wanted and selecting the package and agreeing the price £3999 a month i was told by the salesman that because i had just consolidated two accounts he couldnt process the order for 48 hours we arranged a time 2 days later when he would call me to process the order needless to say he didnt call and after sending him an email a colleague of his rangthe colleague then told me that he needed to transfer me to a different department as i was a business customer i then began the whole process again with a woman who told me that the price offered to me and which i could see onlinewas only available to new customers so for being a bt customer for 33 years i have to pay moreeventually when i told her that i was not prepared to pay £50 a month and had already agreed £3999 she said that she would process the order at that pricethen she told me that there was a problem processing the order she needed to place it with the back room team who were not available as it was a saturdayi was told that they would email me confirmation of the order no earlier than monday of the following weekby wednesday i had heard nothing so i rung bt and had two calls each over 40 minutes having again agreed the package and the price i was put on hold minutes passed and whilst idling on the phone i started looking at other providers and discovered that zen offered a faster fibre bb at the same price with a guarantee of no increase at the end of the contractso when the bt salesman finally returned to me to say that he was ready to place the order  i told him that i was sorry but had had enough of bt and would be going elsewhere no order was placed and i bid bt farewell  or so i thoughtafter placing the order with zen i was told by them that there was an open order on my line that was a week ago since then ive been batted back and forth between zen and bt  the former saying they cant process my order because of the open order on the line  bt denying that any such order exists last week  in one such call  i was transferred to kevin in the loyalty section of bt who told me that he was able to offer me the same package at £2999i told him that it was too late for that  id had my fill of bt ive had several conversations with bt over the last few days all insisting there is no impediment on the line that would stop the transfer meanwhile i have had a letter and an email from bt thanking me advising me that my new fibre broadband is on its way from them when i ring to ask what these messages are about  they say its just a computer generated letter  and again swear blind that no order exists its impossible to find out who is at fault here  but i can see no reason why zen would be giving me false information  whereas i am getting every indication from bt that they are frustrating the process of transfer as best they can i havent gone into the detail of some of the utter stupidity of what they are telling me  the fact that you can never speak to the same person twice  the fact that they cannot transfer calls internally  that they cannot send you an email on an address that can be replied to the fact they they sign emails with a name that is not in fact their name eg mike lincoln is mike who works in lincoln all of this designed to make sure that you can never get back to the person who had assured you that they were on your case just a horrible sick joke of a company', 'promised fibre broadband was available in our new home however bt engineers say

procedures to reset the connection and after a few attempts the fault reemerged connection failed  i contacted world pay card machine provider and over the few months they changed the card machine twice in an attempt to see if its their machines are faulty this was not the case and world pay kept asking me to contact my internet provider bt i had enough of this constant issue that i decided to change internet provider and giving bt a months notice to terminate my contract i was furious when i received my final bill payment and bt charging me an extra month for leaving  when i contacted bt about this they said theres nothing they can do as they dont have any record of any previous complaints after wasting so much of time and effort to try to resolve the issue and to remain with bt this is what i get offered a £30 reduction  its an insult to all i have been through  i have never experienced such a bad level of service and this is a warning to all and specially businesses to keep their distance from bt i find it an irony that when one calls bt one is constantly reminded that the phone calls could be recorded for customer service', 'terrible experience  we received our router and set it up but the service didnt start on the date promised many calls later we were told that they forgot to add our address to the system  they cancelled our order and said that they would add it

been charged £12175 so if want a guaranteed price every month dont get a contract with bt we have also been charged for a engineer to come out even though they said we wouldnt have to because it wasnt our fault the wifi was broken it was the council so if you want a trustworthy broadband and a bill the same price every month dont go with bt there is not good customer service they never communicate

cancelled my phone and broadband with sky on my behalf they sent me several emails stating a date when my router would arrive and the date when my broadband be started the day came i set it all up and

after waiting for 15 minutes for them to answer the phone was told that there wasnt a portal for them to connect us to so the order had been cancelled yet no one had contacted me i was told that i would have to wait 24 hours then ring back again to re order so i did just that to be told on this occasion that i could only have the copper connection and had to go on a waiting list for the fibre connection and there was no time frame i had to wait for someone to cancel theirs and then take my place in the queue also that i could not have my google home as agreed on my previous deal as it wasnt on this copper one maybe when i finally got onto the fibre they would see what they could do i cant believe that a big company like bt couldnt still give me the gift as some sort of compensation for all the inconvenience that was caused by them i am absolutely disgusted by them do not go with them their deals are a scam as they dont know until the date of connection if theres an available portal all to late as your previous supplier will have been cancelled', 'what disgusting company they transfer you to operators 5 time before anyone can help when you constantly repeating yourself i had problems with my broadband for over a year every month was calling bt to fix it am paying for a service they can provide and they make up lies saying theres no information about the faults would

of buffering  internet channels unavailable and with the broadband dropping intermittently we frequently cant find the broadband to connect to even on devices which have been logged in constantly when

have a suspicion theyre messing around with our broadband to force us to upgrade to their new product  for which there would have been no need as apart from the broadband dropping out when the phone rings  was fine  coverage in every room was not a problem until very recently i smell a big bt rat', 'horrible service  on the phone they claimed i would not need to pay for an old contract if i get a new more expensive one i specifically asked if upgrading meant paying for the old and the new contract and the rep said they would leave a note on my account for this conversation of course they sent a £200 bill for the old contract  on top of paying for their superfast fibre 2 when i called they said no note could be found on my account and i should wait for the charge to come through and speak

put fibre opic in the area we were super excited but all they did was slowed all our wifis down to crawling speed and the only way to speed it up to what it used to be is by buying fibre opic which is

sending us bills for i couldnt believe the incompetence and sheer cheek they apologised and said that they would reimburse us and sort out accounts so that there was only one a week laterwe received

following day  however the 3rd came and went and still had no connection  i phoned bt on the 4th to ask if there was a problem to be told that they had had a fault on their system and it would now be a further 5 working days until we would be connected  i wasnt over the moon about it but im a reasonable person and understand that mistakes are made and they were going to sort it as quickly as possible  the staff at this point were very apologetic and assured me that we would be connected in the 5 working days  11 days past and we still had no connection so once again i phoned bt to see what the problem was this time i was past around from department to department all in a non uk call centre where all my questions were answered from a well read script  i felt like i was speaking to a politition every time as my question was never actually answered  after asking to speak to a manager i was told that a new connection date had been set for the 25th of the month to which i said was completely out of the question and asked again what the problem was  this seems to be a question nobody in a bt call centre can actually answer  after a lengthy conversation that was clearly going nowhere i said i wanted to be connected that day or not at all and there the conversation ended and a phone back was guaranteed  thus being the second phone back i was promised  the first one never came i did however get a call back at half 5 that evening to be told that all they could assure me of is that the 25th would definatly be our connection date but they could review it on the 17th  after having enough i went ahead and cancelled the order and phoned virgin to be told they can have me connected in 3 days  we are now happily connected with virgin and now all that remains is a

is always dropping and the speed is rubbish bt it has sent me 7 internet hubs and open reach engineers to try and resolve the problem customer services officers in dakata are very rude and unprofessional sent email to complaint to bt over a week ago  a lady called pooja ring me from india asking me for my full name address  telephone without introducing herself  i have to forced her name out of her mouth bt has refused to compensate me for the inconvenience and time taking off work  i will never recommend bt to anyone', 'worst internet provider ive ever seen  very poor service in addition to a total absence of customer service i think i cant find a worse service provider', 'shocking cuts off every other second avoid at all costs', 'disgusting service and quality as ours was a temporary move i was assured it would be easy to move back and quick 6 months on we tried to do this and were told it would be approx a week then the fun begins the service was switched off 5 days early when i contacted bt i was told nothing they could do and it would take nearly 3 weeks to reconnect i escalated the complaint and was ring back by a very rude and intimidating lady again i escaped the complaint and said i wanted to cancel and was told some one would ring me within 24 hours one week later someone rings no resolution just had the phibe put down on me  i have just rang cancellations to check whether it has been done and been told i have to ring again tomorrow as they cant cancel within 24 hrs of the order been cancelled i have now wasted countless hours talking to no one that seems to be able to do anything i am disgusted with the conduct and manner of this company and will be going down the communication ombudsmen route as no joy with bt i wish i had never joined this company and will make sure i never do again', 'my elderly parents live in a remote house on an island in orkney  scotland they have been through a tortuous year with bt as their service provider  they have now been completely without a landline or internet for 11 weeks  let alone any chance of broadband my father has been building a new house over the past few years next to the original croft cottage he owns in november 2016 he contacted bt to ask them to move the line from the old house to the new house and was told this could not be done until february 2017 the phone line then developed a fault around december 2016january 2017 time and an engineer was not sent out until february the engineer repaired the fault but would not move the phone line my father phoned bt again to be told that the line would be moved on the 19th may at this point  the executive complaints department took over following a complaint bt then came back saying that my parents would need to register the new house as a different address  despite it being literally next door to the original house cutting this part of the story short  the planning department at the council agreed that this was not necessary the bt engineer failed to turn up on the 19th may  and my parents landline and internet were both completely cut off by bt on this date since then  there have been 4 more arranged dates on which engineers were supposed to turn up but have not done so  with no notice or explaination  11 weeks after the phone was cut off and the best part of year since my father asked bt to move the line and he is no closer to getting it sorted the executive complaints department has been phoning my father on his mobile regularly but is unable to tell him why the engineers have not kept to their appointments or when they will actually turn up to fix the problem my parents have also been in touch with the ombudsmen  the local mp and the local newspaper and are no closer to getting a resolution  which is why i am posting on here on their behalf they have no internet to do so themselves bt has a universal service obligation to provide all households in the uk with a landline  even in remote parts of the country  and they are certainly not fulfilling this  to have a working phone is a lifeline on a remote island as the mobile signal is not always great my father is in his 70s and my mother  her late 60s and are currently without any reliable way to contact the emergency services should the need arise', 'worst internet provider i have ever experienced  internet has been down over 1 month  bt has skipped 3 appointments schedualed to fix the internet', 'such a shame bt sell you a product then tell you two years later that you do not even receive the minimum speed because you do the speed checker and they tell you there is a fault to add insult to injury they take from february until july after a second complaint made to get someone who speaks english to call you no compensation a 12 month offer on a lower speed  because they cant supply the one they sold you in the first place and when you call to cancel the bt sports which was free to begin with they make another offer which is good but no can do as we have already chosen to leave you a big fat con feel really cheated out of lots of money avoid', 'lack of customer regard or care would not recommend to anyone wanting a land line andor internetrecently  i got a letter from bt about our service  and when reading i found out that my mothers name was still on the bill  something i have trying to sort out for years  clearly with no progress however two weeks ago something must have changed as when i woke on friday 4th august  i found out i had lost all internet as a business owner hotel and restaurant this is a major problem as i lost connection to all social media advertisement  but even more worryingly  all online bookings resulting in me having to stop taking online bookings  a majority of my bookings customers and residents expect internet as it is advertised  so we had to apologise saying i will try and sort it out on monday with bt being closed after 5pm friday until monday things went from bad to worse when my son informed me that he couldnt phone us up when enquiring further  i discovered that our phone number no longer worked for no explained reason i later found out the bt had changed our number without informing me i was no a business owner with no way of taking bookings without internet  there is no way i can update my website or social media to my new unwanted number  and all my business cards have the incorrect number on i had to last the weekend without any phone or internet connection unable to take any bookings or get in contact with us for enquiries or reservation hoping that it would be sorted by someone at bt on monday on monday  i got in contact with a woman at bt and asked her to fix the change i spent hours on the phone and made no progress the next day i tried to get in contact with the same woman but it just rang through  noone picking up as though she was ignoring me as a result  i had to start the whole process again with another member of the bt staff once again  i spent hours on the phone from 10 until 1230 and made no progress my wife then got in contact with someone else at bt  who promised to sort it out  yet we havent heard back from him i then recalled someone at bt and get through to another member of staff this gentleman seemed to get really annoyed with me and was not polite at all he told me that he would sort out the internet and phone problem in 24 working hours it had now been 5 days without phone or internet  and was going to be a further 2 days any l business owner would tell you problems like this can put immense pain and stress on a business financially  and emotionally i waited 24 working hours  and still  no improvement i recalled bt and when through the hours long process again  only to get told at the end that they would not be able to correct the phoneline and internet for at least a few weeks this is outrageous no small business can last weeks with no bookings  no reservations  and no enquiries with a lack of customer service  or care and noone from bt feeling any remorse  and worst of all  no apology for changing the phoneline and removing the internet with no warning  i would not recommend bt to anyone', 'look at all the negative reviews all these people cant be wrong and they arent avoid bt i have been trying to correct an overcharging error on my account

bt again and this time were told could not book engineer appointment as it was an external fault  however when i told them they had already supposedly fixed the external problem they suddenly could book an engineer  finally we thought the problem is going to get fixed  how wrong we were today 090817 we recieved a text message from bt with links so that we can check the equipment for ourselves and if bt send an engineer and find the fault is not there equipment then we will have to pay them £12999 for the engineers visit surely this is what you pay your line rental and bills for  its called

dates and when you come to the end of your contract they add charges to change provider all of this i have documented proof of i would never recommend bt to anyone and will never use them again for any services', 'i changed to bt from sky in the knowledge that bt are the leaders in broadband technology what a mistake that was  my internet is so bad that it took me 1 hour to lodge a complaint on the bt website was contacted by staff who assured me my internet speed is good and the fact that i cannot stream a movie while sitting 10 foot away from the router is down to interference told me to get an ethernet cable and plug it into my ipad i questioned why i never suffered from interference while with sky and had perfect connection staff proceeded to try and upsell me further products in order to receive a satisfactory broadband service i stated i would not be paying more money and i felt like bt were conning customers and extorting money from them by providing a poor service in order to upsell the staff members manager was supposed to call me back but didntthe bt website is not user friendly for making a complaint and i believe bt are being dishonest with the service they offer

it was literally unusable  but their customer service was so bad it took many hours and phone calls before they actually did it at first they just tried to tell us it was impossible', 'abysmal 3 months currently stuck with bt at the moment was unfortunately lulled into a false sense of trust and security by one smooth experience with them in the past this seems like a distant memory now after 3 months of beyond the worst imaginable customer service to elaborate on this just a little our original order for tv and broadband was mysteriously cancelled by one of bts own staff members and the same individual brazenly called us and suggested we had cancelled it until we were eventually told it was due to a supplier issue and reorderd the package for us there has been later suggestion that the offshore workers cancel orders and put new ones through in order to earn commission and simulate a sale that they have made only they did not put through a replica of the deal that we ordered it was put through with none of the add ons  with 3 mysterious connection charges adding up to 16999 £100 more than the original order  a lower broadband speed than was offered at the time of the original order and at a higher rate of expense the cancellation meant we had to wait longer for our internet services to be switched on and a lot longer for the tv package to be fixed three months down the line we further still dont have the free upgrade to the higher speed broadband package that was on offer when we placed the original order  we have now been declined cashback through a third party because the original order was cancelled and therefore not tracked this is something that is no fault of our own but sees us £90 down  an incentive behind our choice taken away from us all this doesnt even take into account the time that my partner and i have had to waste talking to bt representatives  incredibly disruptive to both work and free time representatives that call randomly instead of ant previously agreed times and make it incredibly difficult to get back in touch with them i dont think any of them read the notes  we were constantly having to spend time reexplaining the complete mess they had made of it very few positives to be said for the process and absolutely no sign of an apology our open complaint seems to have now disappeared for a second time and there seems to be no level of accountability being taken  its as if we are wasting their time to top this off  our broadband stopped working 6 days ago we logged the issue with them and there was supposed to be a three day turnaround what actually appears to have happened is they have closed the initial log as complete pretending they met their sla and then relogged the issue themselves at a later date 6 days on we are still waiting with no internet and no contact from bt this really is only the key points and i think i could now spend weeks writing a book on the failings of bt  i cant recommend due to their inability to provide a reliable service or react with any level of problem solving ability and customer care when things do go wrong we still live in hope that they show us some respect and somehow turn it around', 'terrible  terrible and worse than terrible  i moved to the uk from the us prior tenants had used bt fibre broadband and tv so i contacted them and requested same plus phone

why he was sent to check my perfectly operating phone line  multiple broken promises and lies in several different accents  no email updates or any kind of return communications from bt including a bt rep who scheduled a day and time to call me and never did and their inability to set up my tv whilst the broadband wasnt connected  i gave up  bt is probably the worst company i have ever had the displeasure of trying to work with  british radio is wonderful  but three weeks disconnected from the outside world was too much fortunately  sky for tv was an absolute joy to work with and zen for

up massively and dont tell you  when you come to renew they dont give you the same deal as a new customer can get on their website  they expect you to pay more  absolutely no loyalty  and when you say you want to cancel and go with another company they make it really difficult and put you through to these people who have a really bad attitudes and speak to you like your stupid  trying to negotiate with the price when all i want to do is leave them and not get messed about  and then they charge you for ending the contract even though its out of contract  awful experience  i will never go with bt

handle the bandwidth of everybody at peak times  i contacted them a few weeks ago and they said they would monitor the connection 8 router resets later over 4 days they claimed it had not dropped in the 4 days they was monitoring clearly they cant admit to the real issue  they also told us that in their tcs it states that the connection can drop up to 5 times a day so tough luck i signed up for 2

weekend i get up to 8mg yet i still pay the price for up to 32mg i then get emails asking me to take the higher broadband higher price and supposedly higher speeds yet bts own engineers state i could never get over 32mg with the line i have now but still they push me into getting the higher broadband just so i have to pay more for the same as i get now something should be done about bt and there practises', 'it was reported that bt loses broadband customers over other providers the financial times and here is why  i am a psychologist and normally i use large quantity of data to conduct analyses and draw conclusions very cautiously in this case however  i have a definite answer to the question why bt loses customer because i am one or rather i was one until a moment ago  reason 1 speed does not matter  we signed up to a plan that was up to 76 mbps but we suffer from slow connection and constant internet dropoffs it turned out that we received on average a 30 mbps broadband according to the engineer bt sent to our house  in the course of checking the problem we thought it was not what we signed up to but bt insisted that they had provided satisfactory service  we were told that a contract of up to 76 mbps means a service of 176 mbps and the guaranteed speed was determined by a rather mysterious equation that the bt server decided upon running a couple of weeks after the customer registered many factors could influence the guaranteed speed such as the service to a nearby household therefore  each line could be different and in our case the number was 17 therefore  we received a service of 30 which was faster than what we should receive so bt could not admit they did not deliver a service they had promised despite we had been paying for a plan of 76mbps excuse me  up to 76  reason 2 wifi is not their problem but mine  the customers we were unable to watch a movie by streaming neither from apple tv nor fire tv because it would be constantly loading when i mentioned this as an evidence of poor broadband service i was told that bt only guaranteed a wired connection and wifi signals depended on too many factors that they could give no answer to a wifi problem as we already received faster speed than we should not what we paid for though the wifi connectivity issue had nothing to do with their business one of the technical support advisers was kind enough to suggest me to use a portable radio detector to look for the potential object that could significantly interfere with our wifi signal in our house  but again  that was not what bt should be concerned about  as a matter of fact  bt provided a signal extender to plug in beside the tv and for the tv box actually we constantly lost signal of tv channels too the channels through the box not the antenna  which indicated they were not so innocent an noninvolvement of the wifi problem after all they knew a signal extender was necessary although it did not work  reason 3 tick the box and kick the ball  as described above  the conflict between bt and us the customer was quite difficult to solve even for a psychologist who studies problem solving on the one hand bt thought they provided a satisfactory service above 17 on the other hand we felt let down and not given what we paid for there was a huge discrepancy between 30 and 76 after all  when we started expressing our dissatisfaction and suggested we would leave bt as a result of this dissatisfaction  we were forced to speak to different persons from different teams  including customer service  technical support  and different levels of managers  at least 10 of them all of them suggested something but could not improve our satisfaction which was a matter of fact why see reason 1 and reason 2 because speed does not matter to them and wifi is not their problem  in this dilemma  bt did employ the best strategy which was to tick the box and kick the ball each of the personnel said what they could not doing anything please keep in mind they merely talked over the phone except for sending a person who confirmed that we did receive a speed of 30mbps and then passed us to another person i felt like i was talking to many tape recorders as they repeated the same things  such as you have received a faster speed than you should  so many times  the end or never end we paid a penalty to leave bt we are celebrating because if there has to be a cost of breaking free  we were happy to pay for it what matters here was to stop losing and suffering any longer  hooray bt should celebrate

test it and they refused spoke with one young lady who to be fair was very helpful and she got us to press the reset button on the rear of the hub that sorted the problem in the short term but we are

speed with download limits than continue with such a horrible service  but unfortunately  they want me to pay a discontinuation fee of some sort i think i might take this to court since there are many

over and i had no internet so after 30min they opened a case to escalate to the 2nd line team  witch called in the morning so was fast  the guy called me today to check if there was still no internet

that i have been with bt ive had a number of problems with both internet speed  connectivity and rude staff when i first got bt installed i had no problems at all then  after about a month  my internet speed plummeted and was barely usable on one occasion it took 52 hours to download a 20gb file for a ps3 game that i was trying to play on many other occasions i was left in a mess when my internet connection was so bad i could not even submit essays for university when i first moved house  i was told that my bt services would be transferred and available to use by a particular date on this date  i waited until 10pm for my phoneline to be connected but did not have a broadband connection i waited until the following day  thinking maybe there was some kind of delay three days later  i still had no broadband connection so made a phonecall to see what was happening at first i was told that i did not have a broadband deal associated with my account i told the operator that there must have been some kind of mistake  explained the situation and was told it would be dealt with within 48 hours after 48 hours i still had no broadband and was relying on mobile internet in a very poor coverage area to sendreceive emails i contacted bt again and was told that there was no record of my broadband service i explained the situation and  again  was promised action within 48 hours another 48 hours passed and no broadband connection appeared i rang to complain again and ask what was happening  this time to be told that when i changed address i had removed the broadband option from my account this was not the case  why would i get rid of my broadband at this point i was told that a bt operative would look into the matter and get back to me when i received a phonecall the following day  i was told that my broadband service was still active at my old address and had not been moved to the new address with my phoneline i was confused and angry at this point and demanded something be done i was told that the only course of action was to place a new broadband order which could take up to 14 days to put into place i had no choice but to accept and waited for my order due to an unknown problem  it took 21 days for my connection to be installed and  once it was installed  it did not work i had no broadband connection at all during one of these phonecalls  after being on hold for 18 minutes  i was talking to an adviser when she put the phone down for no reason and i was forced to ring back and wait in a queue for a further 25 minutes i made over 20 phonecalls to bt to get this sorted and  after nearly another week  my broadband connection was working for the next few months i had a slow internet connection  sometimes slower than dialup  and was told by friends and family that they could not get through to my landline number at times eight months later  i moved house again i was told that my broadband and phone service could be transferred to the new address without a problem however  after going through the process  i was given an engineering appointment that was two weeks after i moved in realising there was nothing i could do about this  i waited for the appointment i then received an email stating that it was going to cost £130 on top of my normal bill to get my services transferred to the new address this brought my bill for that month up to £210 another obvious problem here was the cost of my bill before service charges for the last year i have not received a bt bill for an amount less than £60 when it should only be £40 ive questioned this and was told it was because of my phone usage i should get free evening and weekend calls but  as i can see clearly on my bill  i have been charged many times for evening calls sometimes up to £3 per call now  after nearly a month of living at my new address i have found that the slow broadband problem has followed me some days i get a solid 19mb connection  other days im lucky if i get a 1mb connection for the past three days i have noticed my broadband connection has been particularly slow so slow  in fact  that it takes roughly 20 seconds for a website to load and i have to let youtube videos buffer for 510 minutes before i can play them overall  bt have been a totally useless  terrible internet service provider with bad customer service the only reason i am still with them is because every time you move address your contract is automatically renewed for 12 months as soon as my contract has ended i will be looking for a new isp and warning everyone i know to avoid bt in the future', 'worse company to ever have any service from had to check my bill monthly as i was being over charged customer service was awful would not recommend anyone to choose bt', 'broadband stopped working  took 2 months and lots of wasted time to get an engineer out  despite them admitting it was their fault having fixed it they then  without notifying  added £130 charge on to next bill for line improvements they did remove it once i wasted more time going through their awful contact system but whole process felt like corporate sharp practice and that they had put an awful lot of time into trying to design a system so they dont provide customer service if at all possible', 'bt is great i keep finding my self coming back to bt over and over again the indian call

year i suffered the slowest possible speed of any broadband ever i contacted bt on numerous times and asked for a partial refund which they politely refused eventually they sent out an engineer to solve the problem so once my speed improved i decided to stay with them for another year and give them benefit of my doubt well from bad to absolutely awful  early september this year i decided to leave this so called organisation i cancelled and got a mac code to give to my new provider only to discover 1 month on bt are still charging me for something i do not receive despite numerous calls this continues so the ombudsman it isbt have given me the worst customer service i have ever received and they blame this on my new provider apparently they never informed bt utter crap bt id give you a zero if it were possible', 'bad customer service  i have been tied into contracts with them for the last 4 years due to house moves and them renewing my contract every time i move at one point they wrote to me asking if they minded if they cancelled my contract because someone else wanted to use the same number as me and when i called them and said i was happy for them to cancel the contract they then threatened to charge me a penalty of hundreds of pounds because cancellation of the contract would be my fault  i am now desperate to leave them and literally halve my bills for broadband and phone and they wont give me a mac code to move my broadband  even requesting a mac code from them takes ages as they are aggressive when you ask for it and you have to keep repeating please give me a mac code for 20 minutes before they will even put in the request  i am three days away from reporting them to ofcom  i will never use bt again', 'absolutly disgusted with bt im a new broadband

cancelling my contract that hasnt even started you have been warned', 'i have no other option but to get in touch with of ofcom  bt should not be allowed to carry on like this  endless phone calls to

problem bangs on his keyboard for couple of mins then says give it 48 hours and it should be back to how it was  48 hours later still the same so i get back in touch with them another guy goes through the same dummy steps and says that hes put it on record and they will look into it  week later still the same so ring them again and explain it woman says it could be the hub so she will send one out could take 3 days to come  3 days later no hub so get in touch with them again have to go through all the problems again with them even tho it was supposed to be on record so i wouldnt have to explain anyway woman from bt says there is nothing down saying a hub was sent out and she is processing it now to get one out asap so couple days later hub arrives set it up try speed tests and its the same  so ring bt back up fella tells me that my speed is just over the minimum 46mb that was agreed with the contract  i try telling him that for all these years it was at max so we got the more expensive fibre 2 package now over time its gone down to a speed where a cheaper package would of right for us  but i hate the fact that over these years the internet price has gone up but the speed has gone down  he blamed my neighbors or closer to the exchange etc even openreach were to blame owned by bt i may add  anyway we agreed to it in contract so its tough poo shocking company avoid peeps', 'bt

collection agency and added 25% so it is now £56566 i told them numerous times on the phone the service was unusable to me because the ip address was not static if they had made this clear upfront i would never have ordered but doing so would probably mean less customers so the details were hidden away i sent all the equipment back with 7 days but they then added an equipment charge on top i used the broadband to set up 1 pc and never used the phone line at all how can such a company that prides itself on being a family operator be such an aggressive  venal predator at some point there will be

stated something completely different we called bt and were told it needed to be investigated and the original phone call listed to if we were right they would honor what was originally said for the same price they then said the process would take until the 4th jan we know we were right so agreed to wait with the knowing it would be resolved i stayed home all day yesterday the 4th waiting for my

rings  low and behold its her sam then goes on to ask me again to tell her the situation as she still needs to listen to the call hang on a minute why have we waited 2 weeks then we then had to wait a further 45 mins for her to call back and tell us that we were right however the best they can do is reduce it by £6 which is not what we were promised sam willis was rude and ignorant and clearly didnt care about keeping or losing our custom so after all that waiting they couldnt honor what we were told if we had known that we would of cancelled 2 weeks ago instead of living with pretty much 0

in april the tv has never worked and we just use the broadband to stream from the internet and even the internet just mysteriously drops out fairly regularly ive spent hours and hours  waiting and on hold over the months passed from person to person  told someone will call me in a 2 hour window on 3 seoerate icassilns and just wasted my time as no one called weve completely given up and resigned ourselves to the fact that bt was a complete waste of time and a massive inconvenience weve been in contact with the ombudsman but their investigation said that we should be given a £75 goodwill gesture  whilst in the mean time we still pay more than hat per month whilst we count down the time until we can leave our contract the bodies that look over companies such as bt need to wake up and read he 1000s upon 1000s of reviews in line and give bt an ultimatum to sort themselves out if you do decide to go with bt after reading all of these reviews then you deserve the next 12 months of anger  frustration and wasted money', 'customer service team very unhelpful  everytime i call them to complain about the net not working or the hub not working they just send new hubs so since the past 3 months ive had 5 hubs all faulty big mistake joining bt', 'joining bt is one of the worst decisions i have ever made  in the three months since joining i have had two faulty hubs and have been waiting for my third for over a month now ive been fed a pack of lies about when this will arrive i have spent hours literally on the phone or  more accurately  on hold to their call centres i have now had to explain the situation an impressive 10 times to various people  who clearly cant help me i have logged complaints and heard nothing back from them despite requesting someone contacts me if i was charging an hourly rate for my time id have been on a nice little earner oh and another joy was having to verify my identity every time i spoke to a different person as i had been entered as mr that was enjoyable and not at all irritating however  one thing bt do very well and should pride themselves on is taking my money every month without fail  on the dot no reflection in the charges of the fact that ive been without the internet for roughly a third of the time ive been a customer mind you  so as i would warn off someone from dating a deadbeat ex  i feel i must do the same with bt im in it up to my neck  for the next 9months at least but you still have a chance to avoid it', 'when broadband works its ok but when it goes wrong  good luck horrific sums it upcant believe this is able

the problem persisted but then vodafone agreed to send out a technician who found and fixed the problem in one afternoon the technician martin allison was outstanding both in attitude and skills well done bt and well done martin', 'i have rated them 1 stat as i couldnt put 0 this was my the worst ever customer service experience i was moving my house and need to change my phone and broadband provider bt had promised me to connect the service on the 12th december then i was called that theres a delay and phone line will be connected on the 20th december and on the 21 i will be called when internet will be provided there was no signal on the 20th and on the 21 i called the lairs from customer service and i was told that there was an error and i need to cancel my order and tomorrow they will placed a new order i called bt on the next day 22nd and i was told the same they need to cancel my order and tomorrow they replace a new order on the next day 23rdi called bt to ask for a day of connection and i was told that due to an error they need to cancel my order then christmas came after christmas 27th i called them to ask when and i was told that due to an error they need to cancel my order so guess what is going to happen tomorrow nothing was true what i was told if you have an option to choose a different broadband provider please do it as bt will lay to you and never keep the promise', 'i couldnt agree more with all the negative reviews of the bt broadband service recently installed new customer after leaving sky with near perfect service other reasons for leaving i followed the instructions for maximising wifi signal but was only getting 1mbps thought i should leave the router plugged in for 10 days to allow for the line to settle as advised and retest  it was even worse  literally less than half a mbps called bt and was told the service is known to be unreliable and have i considered infinity  at the first call i said i used bts chose the right package for me and unlimited broadband was what was recommended the agent could see i was getting next to nothing so put me through to the outsourced tech team who were completely useless and after 60mins simply hung up i called back and was told the problem was solved and the case was closed  couldnt be further from the truth this went on for a week and spent endless hours on the phone being told to do the same thing over and over again i had no issues with sky but was told it must be my wifi devices causing the problem and if an engineer was sent and found this to be the case i would be billed for £129 nothing has changed since sky so that cannot be the cause but i declined an engineer due to a complete lack of faith in bt to be honest and not screw me to put a very long story short apparently bt dont do wifi and there are no guarantees however with some key phrases  mention of dsr  foi  ombudsman and some choice posts to social media i was called back this week and released from the contract i cannot state strongly enough  please please please avoid at all costs bt staff are obviously exasperated at the number of calls due to the poor broadband service and that shows in their lack of empathy or drive to put anything right', 'i would give a zero star if i could our  internet connection has been playing up for 4 months weve tried 3 bt routers and a third party router weve had 10 engineer visits despite this we have anything between 4 to 14 hours of no internet every day now bt case management team have stopped replying to my calls and messages i rang customer service and suggested that we mutually agree to terminate the contract early as the problem remains and the trust levels have gone down the drain i was told that i need to pay a cancellation fee as the engineers are still working on it and i refuse to allow them time they have had four and half months to sort it out i cannot wait for the contract to end', 'i had the worst experience possible with btafter ordering the broadband online  bt scheduled the visit of an engineer at my home to connect me to the broadband which is in central london  so it shouldnt be a big deal i was told the visit would take 40 minutes it ended up taking 5 hours and a half  and the engineer didnt manage to finish in the end  leaving me without internet on that day bt scheduled a second visit 2 weeks later but the guy never showed up they explained the appointment didnt go through their system and i should book another appointment 2 weeks later 2 weeks later  exactly the same story that the booking didnt go through they system  hence i should wait another 2 weeks the third time  an engineer came for a 3 hours visit and he also didnt manage to connect me to the broadband bt advised i schedule another visit with another engineer  after 2 months and a half of this situation  i eventually cancelled everything to take sky instead of bt bt told me that because the broadband wasnt delivered  i could cancel everything free of charge  about one month later  i got charged 91 gbp by bt  stay away from bt ', 'i switched to bt because they own the copper wire from my home to the fibre dist box thinking one

was promised on many occasions that someone would phone me back with progress and diagnostic report they never did  as a retired engineer i am appalled at bts abysmal customer support i would not recommend them', 'in my view bt  preparetoloseyourwilltoliveover the years i have had two experiences with bt as a new customer  both of them were ok apart from the waiting time for the bt engineer

as bt did not disconnect the line on the date agreed new tenant made international call which appeared on my bill and now it looks like i have to pay the bill and only after the bill is paid  make another contact with bt to claim it backanother issue was when they promised me new bt hub  at first attempt they sent me some sort of plastic connector instead on second attempt they sent bt hub to an old address third time after i realised their mistake with the address  they cancelled the previous order and made a new oneit turned out it was going to go to my old address as well a fourth time i have lost it  and by the time i called them the hub was already despatched and it was too late to cancel it during that call an advisor tried to talk me out of reordering hub 6 the new one as apparently there is not much difference to hub 5  oh and that if i was going to go ahead with hub 6 i would have to pay for it i have informed the person that the hub 6 was offered to me and i never asked for it  but since it was offered to me i got used to an idea of having better hub after that hub 6 was delivered to my correct address free of charge and 2 days after  we realised that bt sport channels in hd do not work our subscription is in place but for some reason it is not being recognised  this happened after house move so i started a chat with a person  they called me on my phone instead  transferred the call to another adviser who then transferred the call to another team i think technical it took 10min to talk to the first two people and i was on hold for the third transfer for almost 15h no one picked up and i have finally given up', 'im absolutely appalled with bt i would never recommend them for anything absolutely shocking service  disgusting customer services i phoned to dispute a bill and they hung up on me after arguing with me now they have cancelled my account when i didnt want it cancelled  now charging me almost £700 absolutely disgusting', 'if you are thinking of joining bt for their tv and phone services let me warn you that you will be wasting your time and money as their service is the pits of any provider in the country and even talk talk is a better optionlousiest broadband bandwith  cant even print wirelessly cant receive any advertised channels  hd quality is a joke  exorbitant telephony charges  rubbish customer service with useless remote call centre service  to name a few of the reasons you should steer clear of bt', 'im disgusted with bt at the moment my overall satisfaction is making me want to move to a different broadband  as soon as i possibly can my bill is only supposed to be 4300 and has gone up to 6700  however i did go over the time limit on the phone though this does not amount to the amount of money i have to pay this has gave me much trouble and instead of my bills being 5000 they have now gone up to 6000  im not prepared to pay this amount of money anymore', 'pay for up to 76mb get average of 2mb  yes only 2mb thats at different times and days bt looked into it and stated that i had a good service', 'bt has become a worse provider now a days my internet has been doped more than a week now reported

engineer will visit didnt go for work waiting for the engineer in the morning i called bt to ensure that he is coming or not he said yes yes before 1 pm no one came till 130 called again they said it is next tuesday imagine  this is 11th days  i have no internet they have suggested bt fon  open network which is rubbish so next appointment gave is for coming thursday afternoon let us see dear all

pay the same monthly rental as everyone', 'we have recently had issues with broadband  so contacted the call centre to report a fault worst after sales i have ever encountered the fault was reported over a week ago to which after a 1hr telephone call they appointed an engineer he visited 3 days ago unsure why he was there as the 1hr call i had was not enough time to make any notes whatsoever still no broadband  no promised returned calls on the further two contacts made the second contact consisted of a 40 minute call to establish my name  address   only this a complete joke will be

date either after much complaining i was assigned a case officer who told me system had messed up and only way to get internet was to cancel order and start again should be sorted by monday 15th another call on monday to apologise again but not sorted and they cant give me a date when it will more complaining and started asking advisor about their adr and had to be escalated to his manager as was out of depth i have had to keep phoning for an update because no one bothers to call me just been told i have a marker on my line which will take another 5 days to remove so that my order can be placed again order was placed again and i eventually got internet 4 weeks late on 1st june bt are a joke  never switch to them i have seen numerous other similar complaint', 'worst service ever  after almost two weeks with a fault still waiting for some assistancewill never recommend it to anyone', 'really surprised with the quality of service provided by bt broadband  as a first time customer when i was joining bt  i was promised a lot of things but when it came to delivery  they dropped the penny broadband speed which i receive from bt is less than 1mb per second when i called up customer care to complain they said the lowest ever speed will be 512kb per sec i was better of using a phone line modem to connect to internet instead of using bt then will not recommend bt i was charged from the time when bt had not even setup the connection and then going through customer care to explain it back to them was another step so all in all not at all a great experience will not want to recommend bt based on my experience', 'weve been with bt for more than four years now  in the last year our broadband has started to simply stop working at random times this is not convenient for me as i often have to conduct online meetings with overseas offices from home it came to the point where i have now moved to ee however  in the last month of their service  once i had informed them that i would not renew the contract  the broadband simply stopped working for good  with the hub constantly flashing orange it seems as if bt cut my broadband off before the end of the contract because i had upset them this means i have had to pay more than £50 for broadband that i didnt receive this month beware of bt they will not play by the rules', 'the internet itself is amazing the customer service stinks once you are a customer very helpful when you want to sign up but but once you are a customer they dont want to help you', 'the bt internet is the worse i ever had i will never recomend itevery 10

can we do take what we are given i suppose', 'i signed because of 100 pounds prepaid mastercard  which i have never received  when i tried to contact the customer service by email they said that they couldnt help and i need to call to the customer service so i called  i waited 20 minutes to get to somebody just to be put on hold for another 10 minutes and then picked up by another member of staff that also put me on hold for 10 minutes i waited 40 minutes to find out that my prepaid mastercard was not claimed and that they send me an email with instructions on how to claim it that i have never received i am really dissatisfied with their attitude towards customers never again', 'terrible  switched over to bt from sky hoping for fast and reliable internet but reliable is not what i have got my bt hub keeps going into oranger flashing lights at random times  stopping me from watching something other doing my work which is extremely annoying its just a pile of rubbish and am getting very annoyed by it bt need to fix up', 'dont get it the speeds terrible  i cant watch vides on my facebook because its so slow  i cant have more than two tabs open because it makes it too slow to use at all theyve ramped my bill right up to 40 pounds per month and that is not fibre optic no phone landline used to make calls either so to have to pay that amount for the diabolical speed and service i am getting is completely unacceptable', 'infinity 2 capped by bt at less than their guaranteed speed foreign people on chat have no idea and send engineers to check internal wiring when they say it is external fault price is 50% dearer than some other providers and as a loyalty offer they want to charge £5 more than i am already paying', 'previously with talk talk  after having my bank details leaked by them and the shocking customer service i decided to switch to bt fibre  called up and ordered  they cancelled my contract with talktalk on my behalf and even paid off the rest of my contract engineer visit took almost 2 weeks to come out but apparently i lived in a high workload area which is fair enough  the speeds i get are brilliant  i get 71mbs with a cable and right now im sitting in the garden 3 rooms away and getting 51mbs wireless speed  i did have an issue with my phone line and when i called up  they found the issue straight away after a couple tests and sent an engineer to fix it  i couldnt recommend bt highly enough  theyve been great', 'cant wait for my contract to end customer service is so bad im paying for the fibre but not getting the guaranteed speed if i was to cancel early then i would have to pay no one knows what they are talking about and either pass me on to a different department who then hangs up or tries to call me back on the home number during working times  even though i asked them to make a note to ring on my mobile after 6pm  do not recommend bt at all', 'its hard to know where to begin summarising the standard of service ive received from bt recently it seems like ive been battling their total lack of competence since the dawn of time but ill try and cast my mind back to what was a much simpler time in order to recount the full sordid story to begin with i received a bill which charged me an extra £66 for excess broadband usage i called to query this and was informed by a delightfully self righteous woman that this couldnt be a mistake i wish i could track her down now to point out the irony of this statement and that there was no way of removing it from my bill not to be off put  i cancelled my standing order and raised a complaint in which i challenged the charge and asked for it to be removed a week passed  no response i called and was told somebody would be in touch another week passed by  the silence remained but alas my services did not they were disconnected and ran headlong into the abyss from which they are yet to emerge eventually i received a missed call from bt while i was at work but no voicemail with a number to ring back on the same thing happened the next day and then despite numerous phone calls to the main customer service line on my part i couldnt get through to speak to the complaint handler  who remained as elusive as ronnie briggs in the 80s 2 months into this fiasco i was informed that the complaint had been closed  bt in their infinite wisdom clearly believing that when i stated their customer service was worse than being homeless what i actually meant was i am happy for this to be withdrawn without compensation or resumption of services im sure we can all spot the similarities between the two comments finally  a week later  and with my desire for a move to a pre technological village in the amazon rainforest growing stronger by the minute  bt accepted liability for the mistake and agreed to waive the outstanding balance on my account remarkably  the bt customer care machine now went into reverse and having excelled at providing a level of service even the mass murdering general pinochet would have found disrespectful  they started falling over themselves to make it even worse first i was told my services had not been disconnected but cancelled outright which meant i would have to be treated as a new customer and would be charged a £40 installation fee on top of waiting a week to be connected likening this charge to an assault victim being head butted at his own compensation review meeting i succeeded in having it removed i stopped short of throwing a celebratory street party i was then sent a hub the hub was in fact the wrong kind i was then sent another hub the new and improved model did not work eager to play my part in resolving this omnishambles i took a day off work in order to wait around for an engineer to come and identify the problem but in a rare moment of oversight on bts part the appointment couldnt go ahead due to insufficient resources and a heavy workload in a display of gratitude which touched my weary soul they decided to inform me of this 30 minutes after the 5 hour window for the engineers arrival had elapsed and so here we are im now told another appointment cant be scheduled until next week and just so i was in no doubt about my own role in this farce  ive just been reminded by text that if the internet fault turns out to be the result of the wiring or phone socket in my house then i will owe bt £129 to cover the cost of the  as yet untraceable  engineer fair enough id say given the way theyve nurtured me through this difficult period with the care and attention of a first time mother i may one day be connected to the internet again or maybe by that time the internet age will have passed us by either way  bt are a joke avoid them at all costs', 'sometime is goodbut normally very slow  very very slow and unstable', 'quite frankly  a very poor overall service with support staff unable to answer the most basic of questions fault response  expect 24hour delays even when dealing with business accounts its honestly disgraceful how bt can monopolise the internet hardline service with no real comeback on poor service', 'i hate the fact that you enter into a 12 month contract with them at a fixed price and they unilaterally decide to increase your bills by 10% because you are in a contract with them there is nothing you can do to get out of it other than paying the excessive early cancellation penalties i cant even cancel after 12 months as they say you need to give them 30 days notice but that if you give it to them before the end of your contract they count this as your cancellation date and charge you for the equipment under early cancellation effectively holding you hostage bunch of thieves', 'avoid  terrible router terrible customer service i have a faulty bt home hub 40 i was persuaded to switch to bt from sky by a sales person sounded great the reality is different i was sent a faulty bt hub 40  the hub they send as standard  we cant connect to it wirelessly for longer than a couple of hours it disconnects regularly and struggles to reconnect once disconnected this is when we are sat in the same room as the router the internet connection coming into the house is fine  we know this as it was a perfect service when we were with sky and they use the same broadband lines we know the internet connects with the router its the wireless part of the chain that is the issue the bt router is in exactly the same place as our sky router used to be and we are using the same devices to connect to it the only variable that could be causing the issue is the router there are thousands of complaints about fault home hub 40 routers online wish id researched before switching from sky after speaking with customer care i was told we dont guarantee a wireless service  we are an internet service which was such a kick in the teeth of course i thought i would have wireless when i agreed to switch my internet provider  our systems are showing the hub is not faulty of course from bts end everything looks fine as they know that internet is coming into the house and reaching the router its wireless part o the chain which obviously bt cant test from their office we are not getting sent a stable wireless signal from our faulty router and we cant use the service properly as a result  i asked for a replacement hub  they said no we cant send out a free router terrible response i said due to the hub 40 complaints we are completely unsatisfied avoid go with sky always', 'the upgrade that downgraded my broadbandupgraded my broadband from 13mbs to the fastest available in my area 22mbs when the switch over day came broadband down to 02mbs engineer came out to check what is wrong i have been put on an old telephone line that is 11km long  instead of the 2km one that went to a local fibre cabinet that i was using before i rang bt and they say i was always on the 11km line the engineer has tested your line and there is nothing wrong with it i could never have achieved the 12mb speeds i said i told them i had a vdsl line before and now i am switched to a adsl line they do not even know what i am talking about they said what is vdsl 5 hours on the phone and am no closer to getting their big mistake fixed wish i had not bothered trying to get an upgrade', 'ive just changed my broadband fibre package from talktalk to bt infinity  tv the change over was on the 17052017  bt kept me informed as to when the hub ect would arrive   that my landline phone would be disconnected for a while until they reconnected it i set the infinity hub

service in some ways it is interesting to find an organisation that has true contempt for their customers bt pines for the time when it was a monopoly and is genuinely bewildered by the concept of customer service it has been 58 days since i was definitely promised an engineer visit to install my bt fibretothepremises  i have been treated to 39 days of executive level complaint handling and i am absolutely no closer to receiving any service whatsoever from this organisation they just cancelled a promised engineer visit yesterday because a pole is rotten they failed to spot this when conducting a very much delayed survey a couple of times a week i will get a i am investigating what further ongoing work is required message but the only advance that occurred was when i sent them a photo of trees that had been trimmed as they are utterly unable to find this out for themselves  with executive level complaint handling i receive incompetence and unprofessionalism  it makes me wonder what you get with basic level complaint handling do they add arson', 'renewed 12month contract with bt to maintain the discount they said everything would be the same except i could expect slightly faster broadband when the new contract started the broadband stopped working and i am left with a flashing dsl led called their help desk and was told i needed to wait 48 hours before the service would start working and they were going to do nothing in those 48 hours to help children were off school for study leave had to take them to the local library so they could study i work from home and had to sit in my car at a local car park and use my phone as a hotspot so i could work as the 3g is useless where i live  after 48 hours still no broadband called the help desk it sounded like a call centre in india they said i needed to stay on the phone while they tested the line during the test the line went dead and i was left with only the dial tone  they did not call be back after hours of waiting i called again and explained what happened they looked at the notes and said i had put the phone down on the support parson during the test so thats why they did not call back they then started querying how i had my name spelling on the account name saying that is not how my name should be spelled they also had my house number wrong in the system they were now using they had everything correct except they had the wrong house number this support person was extremely rude to me it sounded like a call centre in india they tested the line and said it was fine i must have done something to stop it from working they were unable to help and were even describing the hub and open reach modem incorrectly telling me there were not the ports on it i was seeing they said they would send out an engineer to have a look the following day i looked online when i was using my phone as a hotspot and on the bt site  the fault said it was fixed i called them again and was told to stop calling them they were dealing with it i called them the following day to confirm an engineer was coming as their website said there was a fault and when i clicked on the link it said the fault was fixed  they had a look and said they could not see any appointment for an engineer i asked them were they sure i told them when the engineer was supposed to be coming and they then said they could now see the appointment  so far no broadband or engineer i have spent countless hours waiting it queues as their automated system says we are extremely bust at the moment the children have to keep going to the library to use broadband as their homeworks are posted on show my homework website i cannot do my work properly i need to keep going out in my car to find a good 3g4g hotspot i told bt i worked from home but they are doing nothing at all to help me i would advise everyone to avoid bt at all costs they are a nightmare to deal with', 'we mostly see negative remarks against bt i have

order and failed to inform me the order was cancelled only found out of the issue after calling bt to ask when will the engineer arrive  they claimed they never put it through even though they sent me

completed got a call to say its now complete and will be ready next day this went on for 4 days after which bt claim the advisors did not take correct steps as there are issues with open reach so now been told i have to sit tight and wait until someone gets back to me absolutely speechless and so frustrating  this is the second time its happened to me first time i waited 6 weeks so eventually decided to go with a different provider  this time i dont have any choice as it seems bt are the only providers for fibre', 'absolutely terrible service and the customer service is laughable actually

good offer  i have only been with bt 13 days and spent more phone time with them than i did with talk talk in 18 months  first they are denying the offers of £150  then my broad band speed is below 1 and when i try to cancel the contract they are saying that the 14 days grace are from the order date not when the equipment is installed  this does not make sense as surely one must have the 14 days trial from the installation date', 'it took us 6 plus months to get broadband then in feb 6 months later would you believe a price rise stocking  service when we called asking why every month or bill was different they said its because of your phone use well i almost wet myself as we never use the phone now the operator is stuck for words and says she will get someone to call us asap guess what  thats right no my advice is avoid at all costs', 'started a complaint over a year ago as our speeds are rubbish and connections often drop was told we needed fibre  so i went with that nothing changed

the line is not able to be taken over bt have confirmed that we are out of contract  there is no legitimate reason why anywhere else says that we cant change useless they sent me a smart hub but it makes no difference', 'very slow broadband only had bt for 2 months cost so far over £150 it is useless at night and bt blocked me twice a waste of money', 'please be careful to not be mislead by bts awful advertisement unlimited wifi minutes is not unlimited internet 5 days in and weve racked up a massive bill and apparently we are not new customers so we have the privelidge of upgrading to a

router it would only connect for 10 seconds and stop and then i would have reconnect again and ive done that ever since i got the contract which was months ago i remembered the woman offering me unlimited data for £5 a month and i rang up to enquire about the deal  the first guy had nothing on it and connected me to someone else who said to me they dont do unlimited data at all  so either he was unsure of this offer and unlimited data or i was about to get scammed even though the woman knew all about my contract with bt so in the end im stuck with this phone that runs out of data in about 34 days which connects to the router for 10 seconds each time and its a 2 year contract in the end bt offered me 15gb of data for £27 a month thats a rip off ive seen better deals on better phones for

came back with is can someone just call you tomorrow about this the result ended in me and him arguing over the chat as he would not allow me to cancel my order he said ill just call you in the

i should not have a bill  and in fact they owed me £8191 as i had been overcharged  for several months  i already knew that as my bill had gone up over several months from £4259 to £6598 but i couldnt face the trials of contacting bt  45 minute phone call with david who said he would send me several emails with all the amounts i was owed which added up to £8191 but he couldnt send immediately while i was on the phone because his computer was frozen   ok 2 hours later surprise surprise no emails and no money back  im moving and dealing with solicitors  estate agents and surveyors so didnt have time or energy to phone bt again for another week  till i spoke to rose who agreed bt owes me £8191 but i cant have it back as a refund because they dont give refunds  the maximum she said she could send was£1695 but the rest had to remain in my account in credit for when they start to bill me at my new house when i move in couldnt argue any more so left it at that   2 weeks later another email

broadband where you had to have a bt line to subscribe i took up the offer which was giving 16mps download speeds runnining 2 pcs which is faster than i have on bts adsl standard in my recent new property bt phoned me to upgrade but declined after declining  my broadband sped has dropped we could use 2 gaming consoles  a laptop and phones the same time no problem i rang them up to complain about this and told me that im on the old copper cable i pissed myself laughing asking what copper cable virgin and telewest took over ntl contracts  you cant get virgin without a bt line  so bt have owned the cables since ntl went bankrupt i told him on the phone that if he could prove to me that they can supply the whole country with broadband through a copper line at speeds of 10 to 18mbs then

spoke with michael  form the case management in liverpool that wat it says on the text send to me within an hour of my conversation which was at 820 pm  who was amazing and went above and beyond of my expectations usually  i am not happy with bt  but on this occasion  michael sorted out everting within an hour i was expecting to wait about two weeks and to make a few more calls  as usual if bt had more agents like michael  i would definitely consider moving my mobile service and my cable tv to them thank you michael ', 'our wifi hasnt been working for 3 weeks because they wired it wrong and

contacted them several times already  lets see if i will ever receive it 25 also i didnt really like that i have been charged for 2 weeks from ordering to installation 15  either installation time should be reduced or they should charge for the broadband from the day that it is actually installed overall  pretty impressed with broadband but they should manage other things better', 'never had a problem with my package fast connection  reasonable price and they have given me amazing customer service every single time', 'terrible 3 weeks into contract we havent been connected to the internet

me on infinity 2 despite only being able to get a maximum speed of 21mbps at an extortionate price which subsequently put me in a new contract on a good day the best speed achieved is 11mbps and that was at silly oclock in the morning constant buffering  umpteen faults on the line resulting in being unable to make calls or go online having extra services added that were not wanted or requested and then having a battle to get them removed passed from pilla to post with no one taking responsibility or ownership will no doubt need to take the issues to adr and ombudsmanthe tv package isnt worth

4 days first and last time im with those ', 'shocking service left me without broadband for a month never go with bt', 'in my long experience of bt i can say that bt provides an appalling broadband service although the exchange is across the road from my house the download speed is now only 023 mbps which makes broadband almost unusable there seems to be some continual problem at the exchange

line to work for 5 years and the internet also which operates spasmodically so you cant get a refund each time we are fobbed off with the it isnt us its open reach excuse if you are lucky enough to get an open reach engineer to actually come at the time stated they say not us mate problem is with  bt we are in a rural area with the new subsidised rural fibre option supplied to outside our gate

sorted on 3 different occasions  today open reach tell me it will be out for upto a month bts response is to pass me from pillar to post  ending up with paul from cardiff he read continually from his notes and kept going on mute to write more notes saying the same thing  to be honest an absolute disgrace  ive been with then for 20 odd years and they are happy for me to be without internet for a month but wont let me cancel my contract  thats how to keep customers  what a service   appalling from top to bottom', 'dear bt  wake up we are in 2015 and you are supposed to be a communications company just had 8 days of no broadband many phone calls and texts between myself and bt and the broadband is back on well done bt  however bt accepted they made a catalogue of errors inculing mis communication between internal departments and me the paying customer   they accepted the fault was at the exchange and should have been identified immediately  they accepted they failed to call me back when they called from india and the call got cut off   they accepted the bt staff except the engineer that fixed the fault needed more training and had not done their jobs correctly   they accepted that if they were in my position they would be completely dissatisfied with the service and wait for it  in lite of all this i was due some compensation  yes a whole £15 wow i said lets go and party  or i sugested the bt staff came and worked for me for 8 days for £15 and this would enable them to unerstand a customers point of view  so  bt you have a long way to go in customer service

done ', 'i recently quit my job as a customer advisor for bt  the worst job ive ever had getting shouted at by customers for the failures of engineering company openreach because they are utterly incompetent having to phone their indian call centre everyday for useless updates to pass on to understandably angry customers quite often they will not turn up for appointments because of lack of resource ie not bothering to send engineers out and not letting anybody know  try telling that to customers who are on their 3rd missed appointment also the fact that we are allowed no more than 900 seconds for each call and have near impossible targets  they just want advisors to get them off the phones without too much hassle joke', 'read this guys i never write these but ive had enough now im having to do this on my mobile because my internet has crashed again and india who cant understand me at all or are aware of the details on my account at all decided that its the line which was tested

losing my job and having to move back home it took me 4 months to finally give in and think why not im still paying for it i might as well get internet installed till the end of the year  i asked the guy on the phone for bt if my grandad could keep his home number and i have a seperate one for my internet  the landline was provided by talk talk they said that was fine oh was i mislead when the engineer installed the hub he gave me a new number and everything was working fine then i got a call from bt to confirm my number transfer and once again i asked them if my grandad would keep his number they said yes long story short they cancelled my deal with talk talk stole my grandads number and used it for my broadband so now my grandad has to be calmed down each morning before i go to work because he cant ring my mum to let her know hes ok the phone line has been cut off by talk talk he has alzheimers for god sake you sick people bt just because you cant listen  4 weeks he hasnt had a landline now my internet has stopped working again i want to take this to court and make them pay for this  to fix the whole problem they tried to charge me 50 quid im stuck in limbo now with no

i didnt expect that my bill would go up from £20 to £40within a year and all that time i havent been able to watch full programmes on many tv channels as my tv has pixelated since going with bt never had that problem before real shame because i really like the tv package but it would be as cheap to go with sky or virgin going to change asap wish i had never bothered with what i thought was a good

to unscrew boxes on the wall and expose wires i am still without wifi after all this and no sign of an engineeri  have been asked to buy new equipment and renew my contract before they will help me  even though my contract has another 9 months to run i warn anyone thinking of taking an account with bt not to they have no concept of customer service and i am at my wits end i think i will cancel my

not know what the issue is and cannot be truthful about anything', 'just moved from bt to sky  as my broadband kept dropping every couple of minutes had reported this issue many times but never got it

i was persuaded as itd be cheaper   now here in lies a snag  you only get 14days from the request to get a bt account  even though you may have been an existing customer  to ditch it  not 14 days from when the account commences or the standard 28days you get from the majority of servicesproducts you purchase   bt said i would have service on the 2nd  then the 4th  then 6th  then 9th  this meant a full 7days without bb  with the phone link kicking in on the evening of the 6th  the phone line was noisy for 5days  every time i received or made a call the bb cut out  it did restart but was frustrating  so i need an engineer  to add insult to injury  i get read out a standard if your equipment is at fault you will be fined £120  when i complained and requested compensation  well guess what folks  they will only offer compensation after the fault has been fixed dire customers service  and i mean the uk call centres  awful   as soon as im can afford to i will be ditching bt', 'we have recently moved house and i requested bt to continue providing service to our new place i was absolutely shocked and disappointed how awful bt after care service isfor the past 6 weeks i have made numerous phone calls with regards to connection drop outs wireless failure some how any technical complaints ends up in india those bt indian staff members are bunch of lyers  they will make false promises yet fail to deliver they are very good at apologising but fail to take any positive action i was so saddened and disappointed the way bt have treat me after six weeks i am still having problems with my broadband and bt refuses to terminate my contract without charging silly money i would never recommend bt to any one after the latest experience please think carefully before you sign on a dotted line with bt in my experience once they have got you signed in and got your money they dont want to know your problems', 'worst experience ive ever had with broadband and ive used many other isps  bt are perhaps the most incompetent company that ive ever come in contact with  and i would not wish being exposed to their services upon my worst enemies main points from our experience after being given an activation date that was pushed back twice  it was then pushed back another three times each time adding an extra week after 5 weeks we still had no service and tried to cancel it completely  a bt engineer turned up at our property completely uninvited after we had cancelled the account i let him in anyway to see what he thought  he confirmed that everything wed been told on the phone from the faults team was completely false they told us it was an exchange problem  which he said if true would mean the whole village would be without broadband  which wasnt the case  after 5 weeks of no internet or any service i tried to cancel the account and bt tried to impose a £270 cessation charge  despite themselves breaking the contract by not providing any service  when i tried to cancel the account  instead of actually cancelling it  they just raised a complaint  gave me an incorrect reference number meaning i had to go through the whole process again  which delayed the whole process of cancelling the account  generally  it seems that no one on the end of a bt phone number has much authority to do anything  nor the ability to accurately diagnose or solve likely problems  by contrast  after cancelling bt we went for ee  who had us up and running straight away with no hassle whats amusing is that they obviously use bt engineers and the bt lines for their service which shows just how incompetent and useless ordering through bt is having spoken to several other bt customers  it doesnt seem like our issue was isolated our neighbours use bt infinity and they said theyre just waiting for their contract to expire as the service is awful  if you were considering using bt infinity  id strongly recommend going elsewhere  even if it means paying more  itll save you from hours of phone calls with useless bt staff and spending weeks trying to configure a service that will probably never end up working', 'bt infinity  as i write this im getting ping response times in the many thousands of ms from googlecom and download speed of less than 1 mb  i believe im paying for 36 mb ish', 'this has to be the worst broadband i have ever had i operate on a

system simply will not allow my mac laptops yes plural  there are three in the house  to hook up to the internet i have complained to bt three times and they access the system remotely but deny there is an issue  sometimes i can get access to the www but this is quite rare i spoke with bt today and they insisted it was  a problem with my mac systems and not their equipment i asked them to prove this was the case and they were unable to  instead insisting that their equipment was 100 secure and working im left with no option other than  to sue to breach of contract do not up grade to infinity

there were no issues in my area so i should log on to an email address then it hung up with me not being able to log on as i had no internet i eventually contacted bt after a week  and was told there was a computer glitch and my order had been overlooked i was promised on a number of occassions that i would be contacted none of which happened  so i had to keep ringing back to be told i would have to wait yet another week for my activation date as i write this i am stillwaiting to be connected  so i hope when this happens it is a good service', 'bt ask us to change to infinity we agreed had always had evening and weekend calls for years and asked for it with the new package we were sold the new package with just weekend calls and all our evening calls for 18 months were being charged

controls are useless the customer service is awful i ahve called about the security issue i was first told repeatedly that my account was not with bt and that i was wrong i provided all my details  eventually they found my account from all the correct information i had provided  no appology was given the opperator was short and rude  to resolve the security issuee i was told to put the router in a wooden box you can buy routers that do not have this issue overall the service with bt is awful i have had problems in the past and avoided bt for this reason i had heard they were better they are not', 'extremely disappointed in the service provided by bt  the new email system is a bit of a joke  i feel that the customer service that is provided is just there to frustrate you and make you give

appalling', 'the most atrocious  frustrating  pointless customer service i have ever had to deal with  hours of my life wasted trying to get them to answer simple questions  navigating through their

all costs', 'we asked for a good speed internet as we have a few devices and what not thatll be on the net at the same time theyve given us crap that can just about have one device using it at a time

only use one device at a time youd think itd be pretty quick but no ive never had broadband this bad in my life', 'wifi on home hub 3 stopped working and advice from customer services was to buy a new hub from another manufacturer since bt do not support wifi and will not replace defective hub netgear hub works perfectly  but after about a week speed dropped from 3mb to 2mb so suspect bt have reduced since i am no longer able to support fon usersdreadful customer support and will probably change in jan 16 when contract expires', 'i decided to go over from virgin as bt were cheaper the

would be coming to the village when bt brought it to our local exchange  but 2 years on we are told they arent  this is unacceptable in 21st century in england  time bt monopoly was stopped  we pay a lot for a poor service  worst of all is that letters to bt never get answers and one can never identify who makes the decisions do something about it', 'be advised dont go with bt they are dearer

so high for 10 days service i rang and argued it and had an extension agreed to april to allow time to contest such a high bill just come home and found out they have disconnected me again they refuse to put you through to a manager theyve promise to escalate my case to a special team then i end up back in the loop of customer services who have no authority to help never had such terrible service

being passed about   with employees just hanging up  because they can not check out any problems you have   they are not allowed to look up your order  your account  they can not give you an email to write to  can not accept any scanned documents from you showing your order  is this for real  bt is the worse service in the world  with out prejudice in my opinion   its a joke    the saying   goes i am trying my best to help you  a statement all the operators use and then finally just i will pass you on to another department   they will help you  and guess what  back in a queue for another 30 minutes  and the same all over again   the call centres can treat the customers any way they like  i t is actually  because they can not help you as the service bt provides is disgustingly atrocious  the call centre personnel  really can not do anything to help anyway   so they just give up and drop the call   how many people have experienced this  what can be done about it   as bt just ignores the state of play the company is in    so so so badly organised and managed   i would not work for a company like that    if the centres where all in britain  this would not be happening as the managers would have it running better    the mistakes just keep going on and on    just a monster of  the worst communication provider in the world  they can not sort problems out  they would not know where to begin  our problems are on going and after the initial order was signed we are still waiting for the full order with phone still not here  part of the order was for a cloud phone  they cancelled their visit 5 times since 6 january  changed the phone no 3 times and its still not happened   i dont need to tell you every annoying phone call   as i am sure if you are reading this    you have been there also    i will say i have came across 3 uk personnel at the call centres with excellent customer service  but they are unable to fix problems also   and try and retrieve a password for an old email address   which they sent the order to  and we can not access that either  its just a monster of a company that out of control   but we are stuck with them   is there any better options

problem when i wanted to add a new device to my broadband  partly my own fault as i lost my password however trying to get a reset is absolutely impossible  the internet page is completely useless and

and the so called technical centre in india  who to be fair at the time did at least call back  even though they couldnt fix the problem of a stuck order the whole thing had to be cancelled at started over again and still there were delays and letters asking me to return equipment which didnt need to be returned eventually it was  all sorted   but it took around  4 weeks to get everything working properly anfd hours frustration on the phone to polite but useless people who didnt or couldnt keep their   promises or  who couldnt understand  the issues  since then the broadband and tv service has been fine  with speeds as promised of 38mb prices have however risen considerably over time  recently  they wrote to me putting up the charges saying if i didnt take out another contract with them they were going to charge me around £7 more and would  no longer get sport lite  which i dont watch anyway  i called bt  after getting quotes from  other suppliers and they kindly  agreed to offer me the current service plus bt sport for considerably less than talk talk  or sky   i was happy again or so i thought  then the problems began   the bt sport duly arrived the next day   and i called their sales team to ask if i could have the hd channel bolt on  you would have though this simple request but no  this was agreed and an order submitted told it would take probably a couple of hrs but at worst it would be 24 max no hd channelled 24 hrs later  nada called 150  long wait and user automated system  with a scottish lady telling me how important my call was and would  i like to use their web site which proudly announced sorry for the delay and gave information none of which was relevant or did not solve the issue   on getting through to the oders team or tech dept or who ever they were  the saga with their indian call centre began 150 answered and after a further  interminable wait to muzak was put through the   i  have called them 5 times and on each occasion i have been assured the service will start and on two occasions  would be called back as they were personally  monitoring my order  i have to say no such calls were  ever received and  i am still without the hd version of the channels  at one pointi even   lost the exisitng  internet  non hd channels but miraculously they were restored 6 hours later  i have had to spend hours on the phone waiting and explaining to some very polite but disingenuous and ineffective staff who have basically fobbed e off with a load of old tripe and unfulfilled promises  lies i suppose  even one of the women at the call centre told me she had been cut off by the orders dept every time   you must speak to a different person and they all parott  the same script but despite promises  they dont solve your problem  which in my case  where is my order  in frustration i googled the  bts ceo e mail adress    gaivn patterson   and wrote to him  this at least resulted in  a prompt reply although i suspect it was probably computer generated since it arrived about 9pm in the evening  but was singed from gavin all very mately  i suppose he can afford to be but since iv e never met him and hes not my friend  ifound this a rather superficial and dare i say it american overly familiar way  to sign off to  a customer and shareholder  why i am seriously asking the question   i have now been passed to the executive support team  whoever they are   to claim to be taking ownership of the problem  and not to contact any else in bt as they might get confused   from my experience that would be a racing certainly the  claim they will get back soon  we will see  i pointed out mr patterson that  surveys by which  and others  show bt a the t bottom of the league for customer service and that  now i had experienced the reality  of bt i was in full agreement  i have  also loolked  at heir website on quality issues and they have all the  mamagmetn speak  and about stuff programmes to improve service   quaky assurance   iso9001 in my epxpereicne the assurance rating is  useless since basically bt set the standard they want to meet      one it seems that is not very challenging   and then  they get accredited because they can meet it tere was aloud off giiif about customer care building shareholder value  to persuade gullible  persons to invest with what is basically the  a privatised  po telephones service monopoly  writ large and with a similar level of service to boot  whilst i have been happy wth the broadband which has lived up to expectations i cannot sy the same for their  customer service  problem solving  and their call centres  which are  the worst ive ever experienced  although vodafone on occasions have  come  a close second    i would be loath to recommend bt to anyone they are simply too large  nb 17 years ago my pc got infected with an autodialler virus and bt allowed my quarterly phone bill to get to neatly £500  it was normally about £40   before someone contacted  me  they had already paid the fraudsters in vanuatu for frusdent calls i hadnt made and refused refund  me anything  ofcom were useless  too   although i later discovered i could have sued bt to get the money back  i left them immediately and swore id never go back i should have stuck with virgin or gone to sky  the only reason i went back to bt was  because  wanted improved   tv and broadband and didnt want   a sky dish on my house  however that would  have been be a small price to pay given the problems ive had with thier call centres why do these companies think outsourcing to india or wherever will improve their service  i suspect it is all  about saving money of course and not as they claim building shareholder value  i am sure there are plenty of location in england who would welcome bt establishing a call centre there  it is british telecom after all  and not asian telecom   dont bother with bt if you have an alternative   if you have problem they are simply dreadful and their cal centre  staff even lie to you very politely but lie is still a lie    anything to get you to hang up   awful  and i have shares in this company must be mad    they are soon to be sold ', 'absolutely appalling service  still not connected after 1 week of trying  tried to call to sort out and was put in a queue for over 1 hr on the phone  the worst service i have ever

complete failure to take any payment in january  2016 the company sent me an email just after christmas telling me they were going to put up my direct debit payment  they didnt taken any payment in january so i was surprised to get another email telling me my new direct debit would be for less  the logic of this must be that if we dont pay  bt wont charge us  i have spent what seems like half of my life trying  and failing  to resolve this matter by phone  email and online chat bts preferred option staff  both in the uk and in india  are rude  aggressive and not above lying if they think it necessary there is no concept of customer service  and the technical aspects of bts provision leave much to be desired my broadband speed is well below the minimum advertised speed  as soon as my

get through to a good person they are not empowered to help you and watch out for random charges on your bill i have had ot have items removed several times before paying it they also add extra charges to your contract over and above what was initially agreed without telling you if you read the small print it says they can raise prices at any time and youre stuck with it the contract only works one way if you decided to lower the amount you want to pay that wouldnt work i also had a faulty plug on my hub i called up to ask for a replacement and spent about 2 hours on the phone  you cant have a new one  ok can i use the plug i have from something else  no thats not safe  ok can i have a new plug  no  can i speak to your manager  how can i help can i have a new plug and so on i

told to phone their helpline however it was constantly engaged throughout the afternoon   finally after 35 hours when i had just managed to get an answer on their helpline the broadband worked with no explanation  never actually spoke to an engineer just heard another automated message saying we are having problems and for me to leave my name and number for a customer survey i did then get a phone

this message regarding bt support is consistent with how they are respondingtake no blame to their service shockingly i am supposed to provide dates and times when it drops a ridiculous request  since

fighting with bt  to leave a full detailed review just trust me and all the other many unhappy bt customers out there  that this company is best left well alone and i hope it will eventually die the horrible death it deserves the customer service is the worst i have ever experienced  the so called fibre optic broadband is slower that my old normal broadband was  and most of the staff i spoke to were impossible to understand at best and mostly dishonest dont bother going to the ombudsman about them either  they clearly work on behalf of bt and are as useless as a chocolate fire guard beware

and was a long customer they promised me a 60 mbps speed and instead all i received was just about 2 mbps absolutely horrible customer service was finally able to leave and switched to we save who

have put in every month since april last year to get them to stop illegally stealing money from me is beyond words  i would honestly punch the ceo repeatedly in the face if i was ever to see him every month  hours of my time wasted on the phone to some other country  the promises that it is sorted i hear every time and nothing changes  the bills keep on coming if i could ask the police to go and arrest the boss of bt for stealing my money every month i would the customer service is outrageously poor in every respect  from understanding the problem to downright lies about how it will be sorted how a company can get away with this time and time again is beyond me bt steals my money and when they are caught they wont pay it back  even when they say they will  not a penny received  not a

needed it with pc  no probs at all since i moved back to mac has been excellent despite being abroad  the advisors were helpful  knew their stuff  sorted the issues  rang back later to check all was

itself due to the user unfriendly drop down box which doesnt always respond when clicking on a item then you will know where this review is heading worse still my outlookcom email client will not work

miraculously worked the engineer had confirmed that he didnt know the reason behind the loss of broadband or its sudden return  and the only explanation he could give me that it might have been enabled from outside a few days later  the internet was back to its former useless state this had confirmed my suspicions that bt themselves had interrupted my services as a technique to force me to call so that i get hassled about renewing my contract  so  i made it clear to everyone that i was not staying with them only less than a month after the expiry of my contract  i tried to leave but i was told that my contract was renewed i launched a complaint and was given so far three different deadlines they couldnt keep  to investigate how i was tied in a contract without my consent each time i called  they lied to their teeth about staff and theyre messing me around however  they are not giving me any feedback about the investigation and theyre playing the silent game  this is unethical  fraudulent but more importantly stupid by using this technique  bt might be securing an extension of a contract for a while  but they are also making that client so bitter with them to the point of no return i know that bt is a big fish and wont go down easily  but even sharks get caught eventually although i feel for individual employees as theyre just you and me  the organization as a whole had

that a there would have been no need to physically disconnect the previously installed connection  but nonetheless it had been disconnected manually by a bt subcontracted engineer not him though and b he thought there might be some damage to the connection which could have been cause by the previous bt engineer ripping out the connection obviously i cant verify this because this relates to the

said they can sort it i replied with this isnt going to tie me into anything is it  ive been stung before got a no and then found out today it did bt found my call proving this was said by me but after the person recited there speel at the end of the call and i said yes to it  i was saying yes to tying myself in couldnt make this stuff up  what is disgraceful is i have no option to take this

informed me that the operator was not authorised to send me out the new equipment and he would call me back to explain within the hour no call back so next day rang them again 50 min trying to get to speak to them they then said the operator had tried to call me back on three occasions but my line was engaged i dont use the land line for making calls i was then told they would send me out the new equipment  and i was given an order number no new equipment arrives speak to them again and they say they have no routers in stock but will call me once they have them available still waiting for the

engineer whilst he was out and if i remember correctly had around £80 added to his talk talk bill they told him it was up to him to contact bt he just could not be bothered which made me a little cross at the time  but its his moneyhence ive decided to stay put at least i know i just have bt to deal with i cant substantiate this but i would assume that in cases like my friends situation bt

on the wifi which is exactly the same as when we started off so the sent a wifi booster so we can hard wire the ps4 which by the way seems a bit weird in how its set up we set it up and ps4 doesnt work hard wired plus the box then turns amber and doesnt budge and then my partner rings up about 7 times and the whole time they keep hanging up on him then we manage to get someone to stay on the

called them and after two hours on the phone i got the sports and hd stopped and refunded they said they could not listen to calls that were longer than six months ago that they refunded me as a gesture of goodwill but i am still tied into a contract for another year i will then leave as i find this kind of sales tactic unacceptable i got the impression they are well aware of their dodgy

broadband speed  what really pisses me off about bt is how often theres a problem and we just lose internet all together im a student and i have a whole lot of my work online  i rely on the wifi heavily  so when theres an error on the line so it just doesnt work and i cant do anything its bloody inconvenient inconvenient doesnt even describe it and i would be a lot more vivid if i could if i could i would give it 0 in broadband reliability and overall satisfaction our wifi has stopped working altogether multiple times and each time they  around for a while saying that an engineers coming and then that there was an error and they cant so its delayed and i end up going weeks paying for extra data and piggybacking off the school wifi and my friends hotspot which costs me money and isnt good for anyone on top of this because of where we live i dont have service anyway so im not contactable for a while and cant do anything the only reason i wouldnt give customer service 0 is because i have pity for the poor  who work for this company we pay £30 or something a month for this and honestly i think we should be paid for the torture which is using btnever use bt  its hell especially if you live in the countryside', 'speed of super fast business broadband paid extra money for it  been waiting nearly 3 weeks ping 656  download 051 mbs  upload 023 mbs  tested on 3 different websites if

and we thought it would be a straight forward swap to our name this was not the case  we had an order for the phone line and internet to be changed into our name which apparently you need an engineer to come out 2 weeks later to do when this was done  we recieved a new number we requested from day one to keep the previous number as we were running a business and that was the number our customers where familiar with we were informed that as soon as the order was completed we can ring up to confirm the number change  so we did we were then informed that the number would be changed within 24 hours  24 hours later the number was still not changed after ringing back the following day we were then informed that there was another order on the account that had to be completed before the number could be changed as we had not placed an order they cancelled the order and told us it would be another 24 hours before the order would be cancelled and then to ring back for the number to be changed so as you can guess we rang back 24 hours later to change the number to then be told someone didnt cancel the order so they would cancel it and it would take another 24 hours  why it takes 24 hours to press the cancel order button i do not know  since receiving our bt order on 5th november we are still waiting to have the number changed back to the original number after being on the phone many days and many hours i was finally passed to a supervisor who informed me that if i was to pay for the business account i would receive a better service which we were told at the beginning it will be easier to stay as a personal customer for now as that is what the previous tenant was and that it would be easy enough to change at a later date after speaking to this supervisor i was informed that he would cancel the order and he would call me back to re arrange the phone number change between 11001300  did i recieve a phone call  no i did not i rand up at 1302 to find out why i hadnt recieved my phone call and the lady on the phone said she had passed the message on for me to get my phone call the next day i recieved a call which was not from a supervisor and was informed there is nothing they could do as im not named on the account even though they have been speaking to me everyday since getting bt and everyday they recieved permission to talk to me and permission to change the number all we want to do is have the original number back on the landline which has took 8 days so far and still counting ', 'worst internet ever ive tried many different service providers but this is the icing

refund would be in my account in 10 working days  obviously didnt happen my 9 months pregnant wife is trying to contact them  and after 25 minutes waiting on the line which is normal they answer her

rather patronising customer service advisor  goes from the date of the email received on 8th feb apparantly i am tied in to a 24 month contract which still has another 11 months to run i can honestly say i would have never agreed to this length contract as i am well aware deals change quickly along with better prices the customer service advisor within the cancellation team  5th person i got

arguing with them and waiting for engineers not turning up  and my contract was gonna end in october 2018 when it came close to the time they told me im in contract till february 2020 so i took on the fibre package and im only getting speeds of 015mbps i now want to cancel and they wont let me cause they said i have to pay the old services fees  load of rubbish they are and cant wait to get rid of them', 'i have gone to the bt web site entered my postcode and ordered the fastest broadbandtv package available the technician has visited in 4 days to install this is unbelievable right 4 days only what an improvement he told me that the line cant support such high speeds so i need to cancel the order and get another package i have called bt support  it took 23 days to cancel the existing package and they told me that they will order internally for the new one they ordered the same old package with activation date 15 days ahead guys are this a joke compared to international standards i can get a broadband in 1 day in any country other than europe this is not only silly  it is a rotten service standard why the hell everyone has to wait for lazy open reach bustards for 15 days to get a connection get lost', 'i moved into a brand new development mid july and received confirmation that i could place an order for broadband on the 31st july i called as soon as i had the confirmation to place the order the same day i was assured that once the hub had arrived  i needed to follow the instructions and that i should have a full working service by 3rd august the 3rd august comes around and the hub had a steady amber light which indicates an internet problem i followed the troubleshooting instructions which sent a signal to bt telling them there was an issue i received a text message the next day 4th august telling me they needed to book an engineer to attend the property and the earliest time they could do this was the 15th august due to the nature of my job  i am unable to take time off for scenarios like these and therefore my mother attended the property for me the gentlemen told my mother that he couldnt fix the problem and gave us a code which i had to relay to the bt complaints team it turns out that openreach had wired up the lines externally incorrectly and another engineer needed to attend to fix the lines the earliest they could do it was exactly a week later wednesday comes around  the day the engineer is coming to repair the lines and the day i was promised for the 3rd time that id have a working connection  i receive a telephone call to say unfortunately they were unable to carry out the works and they cant give me an indication of when it will be fixed during this period  id racked up a large mobile phone bill due to data upgrades that i really needed as i was exchanging emails from the site team of the development regarding to snagging lists and meetings as well as trying to set up the other utility bills in the house i expressed to bt that id had to add on this extra data due to the circumstances i have noted above a gentlemen told me not to worry and that i would be refunded and all i needed to do was send them a copy of my mobile phone invoice i called the day before the engineer was supposed to arrive the first time just to double check the times and also to reconfirm what was said to me regarding the data refund the women had no idea what i was talking about and said that bt do not under any circumstances offer this kind of compensation she opened a complaint and told me that they would look back through the prerecorded telephone conversation and would get someone from the complaints team to call me back with a resolution to this problem this did not happen i was not actually offered any kind of compensation until the phone call i received from the young lad who had to tell me the engineers couldnt fix the telephone lines even then  all i was offered was £5000 credit on our account which didnt even cover the cost of the data upgrades anyway any how  i get home the night of the telephone line scenario and the broadband was working i sat there confused as to why they phoned me to tell me that the service wasnt fixed and wouldnt be for some time i tried to call to let them know the service was fixed but i never managed to get through to anybody i had a holiday booked for the 27th august which they was aware of whilst i was away  i was inundated with emails telling me i still had no broadband and they didnt know when it would be fixed i decided to ignore these numerous messages as i was on my holiday when i returned the broadband was working so i made another 2 phone calls and an email to tell them the service is working a week later at 730am i received a phone call from an engineer who was outside my property telling me he was here to install my broadband i had absolutely no knowledge that any visit was booked to install any broadband id called them a week earlier and told them it was working i had to turn the engineer away and filed another complaint for the lack of communication i come home today and the broadband hub is a steady amber light meaning theres a problem with the connection just when i finally thought that the situation had been put to bed  the monster comes out the closet and here we are again waiting for an engineer to come to my property and tell me they cant fix it again and they dont know when it will be fixed heres to another racked up phone bill which i will have to pay and a sky cinema package which is totally useless heres to more emails between myself and bt and more broken promises if i had the choice to take my service elsewhere  i would but unfortunately due to the type of internet that i can have in my property due to an arrangement between bt and the building company  i have no choice but to hand money over to company that cannot even provide a service nothing but stress and aggravation since the day i placed the

42mbs  whats that all about if you look at the value of this service that i am paying for then i am paying twice as much for just on half the speed from my original contract i have raised this issue

problem is  all that matters is im not receiving the service i should be to which they respond with their final word on the matter after long debates and endless transferring from department to department that my internet has only ever dropped connection twice during the last year and has always been provided otherwise and its the problem with my landline that causes the problem with the internet connection at my end  and therefor  because theyve continued to provide broadband at the speed contractually agreed upon from their end  i am not free to leave without paying the rest of my

contract yet but it gets better  i was told that bt was sorry that i was leaving i was back on the phone trying to work out how my service came to be cancelled nobody could explain other than a new provider was taking over my broadband  the obvious question was who was taking it over sorry we dont know i was told and we cannot stop it now so you will have a new activation date  saturday 8th october next daytuesday a hub arrived  in the meantime i purchased mobile broadband to see me through well bt informed me via the same email on monday that i will have to pay £65 because i came out of my contract earlier than the 12 months agreed i tried to find out how my service got cancelled but at the time of writing no one knows anyway  saturday morning bright and early i was back on the phone to check it was happening the first person i spoke to told me call back in 3 hours  after a few minutes i thought sod it they are incompetent  let me call again and make sure  it is saturday after all it may well not happen next person on the phone said   sorry we do not do activations on saturday  it will have t be monday at this point i was beyond angry and asked to speak to an english person  well a few minutes later a young man was on the phone with more bad news sorry there was a problem with your initial contract  we need to stop the service and start again i thought  well if that makes it easier lets do it  so off we went  a new plan  new credit search and a new activation date and oh a new telephone number he very politely told me  ring back on tuesday  speak to connections and we will get the date brought forward so tuesday i was back on the phone  again and again more hassle this time i was told the order did not go through  give us 24 hours and call again  so i did  just to be told the same so i thought   ley me leave them till thursday so today i called them again and again the same thing  sorry there is a problem with your order  we need to place a new order  man  i had enough please put me through to cancellations  this was done  phone rang and rand and rang and eventually went dead yep it did  guess what  later i got a call from bt  thought ok maybe now i will get a result sir  she said we need to place you a new order for a new line as a line test showed no phone line at your house  it will cost you £130i almost fainted out of frustration guess what  this

were lucky to get 20  good enough for what we need  but not as good as advertised  and not likely to be good enough moving forward with the increasing demand for bandwidth the price has also risen

time with them  but of their current price and what we get for it', 'i had been with bt over 3 year and i actually was puying more then a any new customer you will get notting for been loyal with bt

ever received  i was initially sold a package which was at a great price and thought this would be a simple and successful purchase i was informed it could take a week to install the broadband  which was not an major issue then i started receiving calls and messages daily from a call centre that barely talked a word of english  and after 9 days realised they were trying to tell me they had to cancel the order and start again this frustrated me but i allowed it to happen  as i had little choice to cut a long story short after 23 weeks i was told this had to happen again and it could take up to 3 months for the service to be installed i simply told them to cancel and i would go elsewhere this is not acceptable for this day of age  and i will never attempt to go with bt again', 'absolutely appalling service from bt waited 8 weeks to get broadband and tv services  engineers not coming to appointments  no one telling me when engineers due to visit  booked time off work and no one even

script  but the issue was not resolved and i was cut off from chat mid sentence bt has been charging for a service it has not been able to provide for several months now due to a faulty hub which their own engineer identified and refuses to replace it without going through yet more test on the line  which is fine as the fault is not with the line  but the hub still not happy and no chance of repair the customer i am representing has dementia and alzheimers  so you would think that they would prioritise essential services for folk with disabilities  but  nope they will not even discuss a refund for the months wasted trying to get the service up and running', 'never had any problems with bts broadband services and the smart hub range is outstanding i dont get any buffering and the additional free services such as the free wifi hotspots are really helpful bt can be a more expensive service but value for money especially in terms of the added free services wifi hotspots  cloud storage and virus protect and the broadbands performance alone makes it worth the couple of quid more you pay overall great experience i think a lot of people forget how much they use their broadband and dont give much thought to it other than getting the cheapest deal available when youve got a household all using the broadband 247 and youve decided to pay the least you can for your internet its not surprising when you dont get a quality service', 'pretty slow service and high cost  very bad customer service but generally ok will switch in the future', 'sometimes it seems like these review forums are just opportunities for people to complain and hardly anyone leaves positive reviews well  here is one for a change weve been with bt for some years now and  in the past couple of years  our village has been upgraded to fibre it is disgusting that this has taken so long  compared to other countries like canada which laid down fibre even to outlying townships a decade ago  but there you are since the fibre upgrade and  obviously  the delivery of a new router  broadband has improved dramatically best of all is the responsiveness of the bt helpline you now get to talk to people in the uk or ireland and theyre pretty knowledgeable whenever weve had broadband dropouts a quick call has restored and speeded up the service whats more our contract is now coming to an end and i found this site because i was looking for a cheaper deal it looked like sse is the only reliable and recommended alternative to bt and i could make a £20 saving monthly by switching i rang bt just to find out when my contract was ending and got talking about deals and managed to make that £20 saving by staying with them for another 18 months ive also saved another £15 a month by switching my mobile account

and did not show up for 2 appointments they showed up for 2 appointments and were unable to do the job because they are just dump and pathetic  i have probably spent over 50 hours speaking to them on the phone in the last 4 months all the bt customer annoyance service assistants on the phone do their utmost best to annoy the  out of you avoid this company at any cost', 'do not touch bt with a barge pole they have been happy for me to pay well over the odds fo a long time £35 over the odds per month to be exact guess thats what happens when you dont keep eagle eyes clamped on these comanies all the time lesson learned', 'would have given no stars but there wasnt an option for thatgood enough to take your money off you every month because i was in a contract but paid for 11 month of no phone and broadband but wont give me any compensation because there pathetic excuse was i wasnt phoning them all the time to report iti would advise to steer clear of bt dont want to know when you complain steer clear of them better providers out there who are cheaper and have better customer services bts customer services is appalling', 'just the worst internet we ever had avoid avoid avoid',

the survey reference number  finally got a date for installation  the engineer turned up after the allocated time 8am1pm and said he couldnt do it  spoke to 8 different people in less than 24 hours  each one telling me something different still no broadband', 'i have landline and fibre broadband with bt bts customer and technical service is all mostly handled via overseas call centres  and they just seem to read scenarios off rote  so dont really listen  if they understand your problem at all  so its a terribly frustrating experience bt left me without a landline on and off for several months when i moved to a new place until they finally admitted the fault was with them  and eventually rectified it it took many calls until the problem was taken seriously broadband fibre speeds were nowhere near what was advertised  and the service cut out quite often once an openreach engineer came and noticed the wiring on the street was pretty precarious which explained why there had been so many issues on top of all that  their service is not value for money i was on a deal originally but i was unwell over a period during which the deal contract came to an end they dont notify you and then started charging a hefty amount monthly as per their standard tariff  so i ended up overpaying a few hundred pounds  so keep note of your contract periods i just swallowed it as i knew i would be moving in a few more months so kept things the same as i didnt want to pay an early exit fee if i started another contract of course  dont be completely fooled by no exit fee either on a standard tariff  as they will want 30 days notice  which is effectively a hidden  fee there are lots of better and cheaper providers out there with much better customer service bt have lost touch and are sadly not a good provider  consistently i wont be using them again', 'youll need a good 4g service with bt as the broadband is not very good bt customer service pointed out that the fast speeds were only for people in the bigger cities in other areas  we should expect a worse service', 'my broadband speed is approx 15mbp  its terrrible the connection drops out and most of the time we cant get online were stuck with them for another 12 months  and it doesnt look like anything is about to change wished id never signed up with bt as they arent interested in fixing this connection', 'unreliablewhen it works  its ok  but sometimes it dies right at the time you need it and its very annoyingits still better than sky but nowhere as good as bt was also  another problem with the internet is that when someone uploads a file  internet in whole house becomes unusable  so we have to use 3g internet for it instead not only does upload make the internet unusable  but its also very slow and even not very big files take ages to upload', 'joined bt back in november my live date was the 30th  broadband and landline was dead rang bt and they too me it was a fault on the line i got told numoures dates to go live it didnt happens no end of phone calls complaints still nothing done then friday 28th dec and bt customer services rang me admitting their was no fault it was the local supplier for the area who hadnt done the work in the beginning they told me i couldnt switch provider as the fault would still be there ive spoken to no end of call handlers and each one lie threw their teeth this company has the worst customer services ive ever dealt with every time i ring i get told 2 days one week and so on a outside company needs to go in and sort them out do not change to bt', 'i get bt broadband for free and i still dont want it giving one star is to much bt have the cheek to portray that the average customer rating is three star i dont think so one star is more like it keep well away from any bt service unless you want to throw money away and go back to the 1980s', 'my issue was overcharging  i agreed a price for a 12 month contract but was overcharged and the refund was agreed but i never received the refund bt signed me up to another contract charged me £80 in equipment fees and wasnt willing to reimburse me very bad experience', 'been with bt for many years now  consequently

constantly turns off wont connect me and they dont offer fiber in my area depriving hundreds of people internet a really poor service', 'after getting well and truly sick of bt saying there is nothing wrong our end when failing miserabely to resolve the uks worst broadband ever  i feel this statement really means we are still stealing a lot of money out of your bank account and giving you next to nothing in return despite knowing we are breaking our contract our bb keeps dropping every few minutes  can barely stream anything of which in this day and age is a crime given the legitimate streaming services we pay a lot of money for yesterday i did a speed test getting 07mb but they are charging me for 50mb nothing wrong our end then eh after several phone calls and endless tech walkthroughs they literally said there is nothing more they can do and i have their refuse package until july 2019 it sickens me to the core we have brand new laptops and phones etc and they all drop bb frequently but nothing wrong our end they even suggested putting a bb signal booster between the bb router and our laptops of which is approximately 5 feet away in direct view they even suggested

think a potato is more reliable back to their support  i contacted them multiple times regarding an issue with the bt app the first person took 20mins without answering a single question thrn directed me to an expert thr expert then didnt have a clue and when i asked a question he couldnt answer  the chat was disconnected their customer service is non existant and if the answer isnt on their script they say they will send an engineer out and then say you may be charged if the fault is our end last i checked this would still be their issue as they installed exerything  avoid  avoid  avoid at all

more and more each time we have complained  by telling us to upgrade to this and that  and im sure we are not alone did this ever happen to you we had an openreach engineer sent out to our home to fix the fault by bt great he found out what was wrong  fixed the problem all good then no the engineer went out to his openreach vehicle and filled in his report stating no problems found why because

fee of £75 is that the same trusted engineer from openreach sent out by bt yes it isive spoken to bt today asking them to change over my account to my wifes name as my health is deteriorating and it

your query and raise a complaint saying  somebody will call us to resolve the issue a couple of daysweeks later someone will call us and give some pennys compensation and do nothing about the issue a

call  the customer service executive said that i have to do the recontract for 18 months again originally my contract was 18 months at the same price as before else i have to pay £120 i was happy to recontract at same price rather than paying £120 i received a mail with the new contract terms wich saying like this package  broadband and callsbecause youre moving home  your line rental contract will be renewed for 12 months  starting when your phone service starts at your new address unless weve agreed otherwise  any other contracts you have will continue until their original end dates i called customer service again and reconfirmed about the contract length 18 months however  on the day of the move 29th july 2019 received a text message stating that there are some technical issues  the services move will be delayed on 5th aug 2019  i was back on broadband fast forward to april 2020  bt started charging me more than my contract price from march 2020 bill i called customer service and got to know my contract is expired i was on call for 15 hours trying to explain my contract was not expired stating to the mail i received during the home move if i was recontracted for 12 months or 18 months  i will still be in the contract considering my services at the new home started on 5th aug 2019 its been 9 months from the move no matter however i try to explain to him  he is in no mood to listen to my explanation he said bt will consider the time i spent at the old address into 18 months contract i was referring to the mail i received during the move but he replied they cant listen to the calls recorded during the move considering very old he insisted to do recontract to avoid extra charges i declined and ended the contract i felt like i have been cheated', 'useless

only to be told that there was a problem with my existing phone line which was being seized by my current provider this meant an engineer that was due to call on at the end of the month wouldnt now call while my services with my current provider are due to cease next week and yet noone from bt contacted me to advise of this i was then tersely told by the bt advisor to contact my current provider to inform them that i wont be moving to bt so ensure my line will be released and yet i already informed my current provider over a month ago that i was ceasing with their services  would be having my direct debit cancelled after the 28th and have also had my last payment with them adjust accordingly to reflect the termination of my contract with them and yet bt are asking me to contact them to restore my line because of bts incompetence and worse is that i had a conversation with bt 2 weeks ago to inform them that my current provider wouldnt release the line which meant i couldnt keep my telephone number but i was told by the rather cocky advisor that everything would be fine inc being issued with a new number and that my order would go through and that my bt services would commence at the end of this month it was also during this conversation that i was informed that my previous order with bt  placed online  would be cancelled and replaced by a new order which result in further savings for me compared to my previous online order so  im not even a customer and im already experiencing problems with bt which doesnt bode well for the future i should have heeded the warnings from

alone why our order had been cancelled after speaking to about 6 different people and a week later we found out that an engineer would not need to visit after all although the 5 people prior said they did  which would have meant another wasted day off work  when the broadband was set up but would need to go to the local exchange  however bt were stating that open reach kept cancelling the order every time they tried to replace the order we still dont have broadband but apparently they are still trying i would avoid bt broadband at all costs as have never had this trouble with any other providers it is clear that their systems do not work and their staff training would appear to be terrible with people not understanding the basics of how their service works if anyone from bt reads this  your live chat is also awful it can say that you have 8 minutes waiting time until the next agent but it regularly reaches the end of the countdown but still  spends ages  searching for an agent

cables etc  which i know nothing about i have dyspraxia and im not good with anything practical at the best of times when i rang bt again  they told me to get my screwdriver and unscrew the phone socket box when i told the guy i didnt own a screwdriver as i cant use one  he got very annoyed and told me to out and buy one he kept ringing me every day for several days but i couldnt answer my phone as i was at work  like most people between 95 when he finally got hold of me  again  he was very rude and told me he had been trying me all day i told him i was at work and he had the cheek to

unethical and unprofessional for an organisation of your calibre they finally cancelled my service  what i will say is ive been with sky for several years and never had a problem with customer service

left waiting for him at home like a mug having taken a day off work for it2 they tried to deny that the engineer was booked in the first place then they denied it was a free offer on the 78mbs fibre so they clearly dont know their online customer ecommerce experience3 i was passed between 4 different advisors 5 or 6 times each claiming i needed to speak to someone else before someone finally decided to take responsibility4 they offered a convoluted solution which involved me paying £130 for the engineer and then phoning them again to claim it should be free unprofessional wasting another day of my life and a potential dispute over the cost of the engineer5 the presale broadband estimated speed was dl 60mbs it is 50mbs hugely off and misleading 2nd day into bedding in youre supposed to allow 3 but i highly doubt it will go anywhere near 60 this and the free engineer socket replacement was the reason i chose bt my advice go with sky if you possibly can over bt  their bt customer service is absolutely horrific and i hope i will never have to phone them again when the contract is up next year i will definitely be switching to someone else detailed experience i wanted to go with sky as i had heard only good things about their overall service and flexibility but apparently being the responsible suppliers they are  they did not have any more fibre deals available for my exchange as they keep the numbers reasonable to reduce the contention ratio and thereby provide a better service during peak times to the sum of their customers  from the remaining suppliers i opted for bt despite the fact that i had received a number of warnings about bt broadband from friends and even my wife as well as reading reviews  but i never expected it to be this bad only two days into my service  i ordered the service online on 06112015 for my new home this was for the 7819mbs fibre service including phone line  in the ordering process i was presented with an option to book an engineer at no  extra cost £50 for lesser deals or self install the service  i chose for the engineer to come around because it included himher replacing the phone socket to a more suitable location the phone line was activated on 09112015the fibre was activated on 18112015the engineer was booked for 20112015 so here i am  taking a day off work  on the 20th sitting twiddling my thumbs waiting for the engineer to come  at around 1pm i got a little concerned and checked up on my order online and noted that the engineer appointment had magically disappeared  so i phoned bt and was fobbed off to one department after another and back again  they claimed that the engineer was not necessary but then i explained that it was part of the deal that i bought so eventually after an hour or more on the line  they offer to send an engineer but to charge me £130 for it they said that they will charge but then i phone them back and tell them that it was supposed to be free not very professional at all and to get the amount credited to my account  i asked them to send an email to confirm that the conversation but the advisor refused and said she would put a note on my account for when i called  i acquiesced to this and asked when the engineer would come and i was given a date of 1st of dec which coupled with the ordeal of having to phone them again put me off completely and i told them to forget it and i would hire an engineer myself which i have done at a cost of £120', 'well after reading all the reviews i have now decided most definatly not going to sign up with them   i find it

it  but is a pain bt have replaced the router but this hasnt fixewd the problem the technology is brilliant i get a consistent 37mb download speed  the roaming wifi service is good and has a lot of convenient access points the new router fitted through the letterbox so i didnt have to callect in 48 hours later from the sorting office if i had never had to talk to them i would think the system excellent i switched from sky who we inherited from o2 sky had excellent customer service  i only moved away because of the cost for the new year after the intro  there roaming service is also very good but the coverage is lessif i can a deal i will go back to sky', 'my change from standard broadband to infinity worked seamlessly hub delivered on time and upgrade occurred without me having to do

that handset in question  i was told till blue in the face they could not provide proof of usage strangely  witch has now caused me big issues with getting my handset replaced by insurance no proof of

them to upgrade to the newer youview box dont pay for it also check what else you have plugged into your hub it may also be affecting when updating  so not all bad but service is still shocking  and

of my questions and yet skilfully skirted around them  with well rehearsed scare tactics  suggesting that i would be charged £120  should the engineer discover that its not bts fault never got any satisfaction after a full hours frustration and aggravation eventually  having had enough  i insisted on being put through to a uk based technical team who talked me through a few checks eventually i discovered and corrected  by process of elimination and from my own skills set the fault itself it was a failed adsl filter  which costed me £199 from the local sells everything shop come on bt  you

mbps now the phone line is very crackly again  and the b t 05 wit attempts to persuade me that that my phone is to blame  and offers a new filter i install a replacement filter no improvement  the

aspect', 'weve had telephone lines and broadband installed at work bt are appalling to deal with the first engineer  a gentleman with a chinese appearance was very good  staying late into the evening to get lines connected but we needed another line installed into the building which he was not trained to do  along comes another engineer who looked at what was needed  decided in 2 minutes he could not do it  walled off and told his boss he was unable to get access to our office suita complete lie  the next didnt even knock on the office door  he just said he could not get access then we were to have 3 lines going to one phone number but at present 1 line goes to that number so if we are on the phone no one can call us  the salesman now doesnt answer emails or call  so here we are 2 months on still without the correct work and without anyone having a care about it any suggestions on how we get bt to do the job they said they could so', 'what is wrong with bt broadband customer care more appropriately  bt customer care ought to be called the bt customer barrier its primary function is to defend bt from the problems its customers may be having and its fundamental ethos is that the customer is always wrong they are the masters of the dismissive foboff this is made abundantly clear at the point of initial contact  its internet pages  where the first thing to greet you is the statement that most faults occur within the customers own infrastructure this bizarre assumption is carried right through the extensive faults procedure where each step is directed remorselessly toward persuading the customer to find and fix a fault that without further investigation is undoubtedly on their own premises and of their own making bt does not admit that faults might occur outside of customer premises or make provision for those who are competent enough to have already carried out these basic checks and want to move on neither is there a clear onward step for bt to take ownership of a reported fault after the checking procedure has been completed  again there is an assumption that all faults are the responsibility of the customer for a persistent customer it leaves the complaints procedure as the only option to progress the complaints procedure is another mechanism dominated by the customerisalwayswrong ethos the first thing a customer service operator will do is to insist a customer go through the same step by step procedure covered by its internet pages  regardless of whether or not the customer has already done this presumably the operator is trained to believe that the customer is incompetent there is a prescripted  condescending and belittling conversation that follows which often involves the customer service operator magically changing from a care representative into a sales representative  offering new packages and various pieces of equipment that he is almost sure will cure the fault the last resort  if a customer manages to stand firm and turn down all these alluring offers  is for the operator to reassure the customer that everything will be all right if they just be patient and give it a couple of weeks then its goodbye during the lifetime of a fault this procedure will repeat itself several times and each time the customer service operator will behave as if it were the first bt appears to have no method of gathering useful retrievable information about a specific complaint or sharing it between operators eventually frustration and anger from a customer will lead to elevation where the customer is promised a callback from a bt engineer callbacks from bt engineers are not lightly won  if you are lucky to be promised a callback you will be given a time slot and an automatic telephoned reminder first thing in the morning while you are still in bed a prerecorded voice message from a hugely condescending and suspiciously sceptic female will make sure you are awake and ready for your call  which may not be for several hours if you are very lucky your callback will be made  but often they are delayed or forgotten or have not been booked at all and  of course  it will be your fault i know all this because i have been through it on more than one occasion my latest battering against the bt customer barrier began four or five weeks ago after i had meticulously carried out my own checks for some months i had noticed that bt broadband was either dropping out completely or reducing strength to download speeds that were unusable  sometimes as low as 001mbps  but mostly between 1 and 2 this always seemed to coincide with peak times when my bt contract assured me my signal would not fall below 5 or 6 my own checks consisted first of looking closely at my wifi which at the time admittedly was quite weak i installed a wifi repeater which boosted the signal but did not resolve the problem so i changed my phone filters but this did not resolve the problem either i tested the line using quiet mode but there was no noise on the line  i changed my router  i repositioned my router  i changed to ethernet and used only the bt service socket cutting out all intermediate infrastructure in my home  and i tried all of the above whilst turning on and off various devices i thought might affect my broadband signal nothing solved the problem at this point i fully believed i had covered every possible selfcheck known to man  but bt felt differently and tried to make me go through them all again bt then told me it was my router  which i knew it wasnt  and that i would have to buy a new one  which i already had  so i declined then they told me that most probably there was work going on in the area that i did not know about  but neither did the operator because when i asked him about it he admitted he did not know if there was work going on in the area or not i actually admire him for making that bit up it showed a spark of spirit eventually he told me everything would be all right if i was patient and to wait a couple of weeks  and then he said goodbye everything was not all right and after two more weeks  two more emails and two more conversations that had to begin from scratch because bt had forgotten everything id said previously  i eventually won my callback from a bt engineer and an agreed time slot only it didnt happen i waited for the call but it never came a call did come  nearly an hour after the allotted time slot  but i was not there having already given up waiting for it and of course  that was my fault again so  what is wrong with bt customer care well  just about everything to be honest it is fundamentally flawed from top to bottom it has a preconceived conviction that the customer is always wrong and does nothing to hide that conviction from a customer perspective it is like trying to swim up a waterfall they make you feel so small bt customer care needs dismantling and rebuilding from scratch  it is an appalling  abhorrent and arrogant organisation that ought to be banned from having the name british in its title i am proeuropean and british  and i am ashamed that bt customer care can use the same designation  which is less confrontational than it sounds given that it is mostly located in india it has become the benchmark by which all poor customer service in britain is measured by  a level of incompetence to avoid its no coincidence that other internet service providers make a major selling point of not having the same customer service setup as bteventually my callback came after weeks of trying and bt agreed to monitor my broadband speed to see themselves what was happening  an appropriate course of action i suggested at the outset no apology because  naturally  i had been wrong to suggest it and it had only become the correct thing to do when they thought of it they agreed to monitor my broadband speed and to call me back after three days after only one day i received an email saying that i should monitor my own speed and send them the results i pointed out that i had already done so  several weeks earlier i sent them new results in all the speed test results sent to bt a clear pattern of dropout and poor signal strength at regular times during the day were obvious bt then took to calling me back at times when they knew my signal would not be dropping and asking me to run a speed test  thereby proving i was wrong about having a fault on my line fault or no fault  bt broadband remains unusable for around two hours per day when this current contract ends i shall be looking for a new provider', 'do not use this rubbish company internet speed in evening is so slow try to call them to sort it loads if times  always rude  always trying to pretend its due to the wireless connection their staff are basically blagging it if it was wireless it would be all the time its clearly some form of throttling bottom line is they just say the speed is fine and are only willing to send an engineer out during the day when the problem isnt then  they are basically getting £30 a month for nothing as i only really want the internet in the evening speeds are often 03mbs in evening avoid like the plague i certainly will even be a customer of theirs again as i will have to pay some hefty price to get out of them and get sky back in as they have point blank refused to cancel the contract', 'i must have been really lucky here  i have had fibreop on infinity 2 from bt for almost 18 months now  i had a shaky start getting the order right and getting the engineer here  and experienced a few router reboot in the beginning but once i realised i needed to get shot of the crappy hh3 they supplied and put a decent router on ive never looked back bandwidth has been consistently high  and i have between 4 and 15 devices connected at any one time  uptime is pretty good too  i think ive only been offline 23 times in that last 18 months and for 5 minutes at most the reason for being offline and the only really annoying thing i have encountered with the connection is that i often work at night and the router reboot itself sometimes  after what looks like an attempted router update or some resyncing going on other than this it has been good as gold and i have to say that around 89 of my friends and family are on it too and none of them have had any major problems to report the one thing i have experienced however  is the shocking customer service  the fact that everything needs explaining in triplicate and that noone seems to understand your point and that they are often keen to pass you over to the next person i find this is the case with quite a few companies who farm out their telephone support though overall i am generally happy with the service and considering the number of folks experiencing troubles  i am feeling lucky that i have not had to spend too much time talking with india', 'our bt broadband experience has been terrible  weve a problem with parental controls meaning

my direct debit payment changed without any notification or warning via post or email to let me the customer know my recent dealing with bt was to set up a new deal and should ony be paying £45 a month but the last 3 bills are £73  £83  £96  i only use the web for emails and searching the net bt cannot give anyone a breakdown on there broadband other than you have gone over  no dates or times

then i phoned the bt customer service i asked the adviser how much of the line need to be fixed the adviser said maybe just £20 on and off but i am shocked when i got the bill  the engineer fee is £120 something even the engineer just work less then half an hour   just fixed the broken iron wire and also i think the company didt say clearly what is international call freedom on the contract for

installation had been done incorrectly and an engineer was sent out to correct it i asked for some reimbursement and suggested three months worth of the cost of the broadband  totalling approx £7500

back the other is the pricing policy i joined 1 month ago  wasnt sure whether i would need 10gmonth or unlimited  was told i could always upgrade later except that at the time of ordering the difference was £ 7  whereby if i do it now 1 month after joining i have to pay £ 11more more because you are already with bt i was told and if i were to order the package now as a new customer  it would only pay £250 more being a bt customer is definitely hazardous to the health of your portfolio', 'well all  i hope your ready for a long  truthful review of bt i switched to them on the 17th september of this year after 5 years with sky  my sky speed was reliable and constant at around 9mb ps  we wanted to switch as a cost saving exercize by getting infinity and tv through bt at £65 a month instead of the £90 a month for sky  what a mistake the order was placed on the 17th and the minimum guaranteed speed was 27mb with an email confirming the same and detailing within it which i still have that states that if the speed continually drops below this guaranteed speed i can cancel at any point  it must be said here that when i contacted sky to cancel  they were reluctant to let me go and they even offered to price match bt but the thing that made me move was the guarnteed speed that sky couldnt give anyways  i signed up  cancelled sky and got an email saying everything will be with you on the 29th september and all will be switched over within 30mins on the 1st of october well the 1st came and i plugged it all in and off we went  except we didnt  i contacted bt and after 15 minutes of being on hold i was transferred to someone in india to be told oh there is an issue with getting the line from sky  you will need to wait until the 7th october  now you need to understand that i at this point had no internet or tv for a week  not easy with 2 kids and working from home  anyways  the 7th came and bingo  the line was readyor so i thought  plugged it all in and away we went  light on the hub turned blue  conneted to the internet  did a speed test to show i was now getting 3mb ps  ok i thought  lets leave it a while and see what happens  turned on the youview box and the light on the hub turned orangeno internet  left it a day and everytime i turned on the tv the internet dropped out so i was now in a situation where i could browse the net at 13 of my previous speed but not watch tv or i could watch tv but not get the internet channels  so i was basically paying to watch freeview or browwse the net at stone age speeds so i contacted bt again and waited an age to get through to someone promising me the earth who told me there must be a problem with the hub  so they informed me they will send me a new hub which will be there within a few days  it arrived on the 11th october  plugged it in  away we wentno change now by this point i was beginning to get pied off  contacted them back and eventually got through to someone who as per all other calls wanted to start off by asking me what type of phone socket i had in my house etc etc etc  at this point i bit my tongue hard  anyway  she told me she was going to send me new filters because they must be the problem  i swiftly told them no  do not send me anything else  send me an engineer  she didnt want to do this so i got refered to some sort of support line  they told me they needed 48 hours to do some checks on the line and they would call me back  well that 48 hours came and went with no call  so i called themagain got through to someone  they confirmed my line was ok to my house and that it was stable and that it must be something in the house causing the issue  like  i told them 48 hours before hand  this was now the 14th october  no need for new equipment the person said  we will send an engineer  great  progress at last 3 days later an engineer turns up from openreach  now the 17th october and he changes the main socket in the house to an mk3  he gets the speed to 20mbs and at which point i tell him that i have been promised 27mbs or i can cancel  at which point he laughs and says you have no idea how many houses i go to with the same problem  bt promise speeds that they cant deliver  he then says he is goin to the exchange to see what he can do  he returns shortly after to tell me the most i will ever get at my house is 21mbs and off he goes so in the midst of all this bt kindly take £70 out of my account on the 15th for my bill from the 17th september  not impressed in the slightest i call and ask for a refund to be told that i cant get one until the issue is resolved  i quickly remark that it isnt resolved  the line keeps dropping when on tv or saying inadequate signal recieved please go to bt helpcom i then tell her i want to cancel because the openreach engineer has told me i will never get 27mbs and i want to return to sky  the lady was ok with this but she needed to refer me to technical support to see what they can do and that i will need to wait 7 days for a call back  well  7 days came and went and by now it was the midend of october  i called bt again  and explained the story again with the cancellations team to get the worst call handler yet and she was british  she had a stinking attitude  i explained i wanted to cancel and that i hadnt recieved a call from bt when i was promised  she rudely told me that someone from bt spoke to me on the phone at 1654 for 5 minutes  i reassured her that if i dial 1471 on my house phone  the last person to call it was a family member at 1111 by this time it was now 1800ish  she then said  no it was on your mobile  i took my mobile out of my pocket and looked to see if i had a missed call or whatever  i didnt  i was leaving for home from work at 1654  i told her that she is either lying or the caller is because i recieved no calls  she the proceeded to tell me that she is not a liar  i said  well can you tell me the conclusion of the call please  can you check the notes of the call and tell me what was discussed because as far as i am concerened i am calling to cancel because i have not recieved the call  otherwise i wouldnt be calling  she then told me she cant access the notes of another caller funny because all the other bt staff could read my previous notes  anyway  after a lot of angry exchanges  i was told by her that her job wasnt worth cancelling my contract without technical saying so   i asked her how long will it take to cancel if technical can put a note on the system saying its ok to cancel  she then said it could be cancelled straight away   i asked her to put me through to technical support again  after 30 minutes on hold i get through to india  i am told by the tech support that the other call back didnt take place because the other caller didnt do anything about my cancellation request as he could funnily enough read the notes  he then said that he cannot put the cancellation request on the system until it goes through the line checks and technical for 7 days  so either he is lying or the cancellation lady is by this point i am losing the plot with them  he told me that he will lodge the call with tech support or whatever it is and that on the 3rd nov they would call me back  they called and i said is it cancelled  he then said no not yet  we are still testing things or whatever they are doing  he confirmed the speed on the line is 20mbs and he said it will take another 4 days  he said is 20mb no fast enough for me  i said  it doesnt matter if its fast enough  you promised me a certain minimum speed which i am not getting  i left sky after 5 years for that sole reason  no other as the price was the same i will now await their call on the 7th nov  at which point if its not cancelled and i am not reimbursed my £70 plus compensated via my phone bill  i will take the matter to a solicitor  watchdog and whomever else i would strongly advise everyone who is considering bt to stay well clear of them  i have never in my life experienced such unprofessionalism or disrespect towards a customer as i have with bt and i will never buy from them or reccommend them to anyone ps 2 weeks ago i asked the bt advisor if i was ok to go ahead and reorder sky tv etc and she said yes  so if i am placed in a situation where i have 2 contracts to pay for a year i will be looking to sue them  i am glad all these calls are recorded because i have done nothing but try and cancel my agreement with them because of misrepresentation if i went to a showroom to buy a car and was only give 70% of it id be able to return it after being promised the whole thing  the same applies here', 'i was quite pleased with bt but there prices kept going up and up so i decided to leave them i received a letter which i found threading and because i am coming out my contract a bit before it ends the are going to charge me over £70 which i find exorbitant as being a pensioner thats a lot of money these companies have you over a barrel so be careful who you sign up with bt are not as good as you think they dont care about old customers', 'ive been with bt broadbandphone at one address since 2352016 and also at

installing the wrong phone number i would then get a text from bt along the lines  we aplogies for installing the wrong number however the correct number has now been installed again and again the number was not correct and once again a wrong number so back to being on hold and going through it all again  ive now had the correct number installed i think which has resulted in the following upgrade  i cant make incoming calls or outgoing calls and that has been the situation since last june its now be diagnosed today as a fault at the exchange and should be fixed within 3 days a long

absolutely shambolic totally embarrassing and so painful to go through if you value your time and sanity i would suggest never giving these guys a go i did hear similar reviews prior to switching over

customer services told me that due to a technical error the order had got stuck and they couldnt restart our normal broadband service until the next engineer visit they said theyd call back in 2 hours with the next visit date they didnt a week later we got notification of the next engineer visit  3 weeks later on that visit the engineer did turn up but said he couldnt restart our broadband because all the information hed been given about the exchange was wrong and the previous engineers notes the one who didnt turn up were incomplete back to customer services the woman there had no record of

fault is not found and to topic all  had an appointment yesterday soda to stay in from 8am to 1pm  sometime during the morning the broadband was going on and off so maybe an engineer was working on it  however no contact with us to say if work had been done or if problem fixed  where is common courtesy at least a call to say what is going on     we are in a rural location which seems to be an

have no idea how frustrating it is being told youre wrong  when you have an email from bt telling me i was in fact correct the final straw was when they raised the prices this gave me a way to get out

deal with the one already open or insist on closing a complaint that wasnt fixed with a few exceptions the support staff i dealt with were rude  at best incompetent and on more than one occasion lied

people are complaining about them and so many unhappy customers we have been lied to and spent most evenings on the phone to customer service instead of relaxing at home with the family tragic company

horrendous', 'literally furious why  why on earth do they exist to cause such misery the worst steaming pile of overpriced horsemuck the connection is terrible  their custom services are useless their

me that i would save a lot of money by switching to bt  which i fell for what a mistake  it was never the price that was given to me  we couldnt receive incoming calls for 6 weeks  which they couldnt explain or fix  no matter how many times i called their useless helpline after being with them for several months  the set top box would only tune to welsh tv channels  which was permanent  no matter how many times it was retuned the helpline is useless  their only advice was to retune the box  or it was the tv aerial  i told them i had retuned it 10 times or more  and it was a new aerial  then to be told  i dont know what were going to do  the final straw came when after 8 months they notified me that my bill was to be increased by £25 per month this was just for a basic service i cancelled my direct debit and just lately i have been receiving letters from a debt collecting agency  demanding substantially more than a months bt payment plus 25 percent what bt added for administrative cost dont use bt they are a lying theiving joke', 'i had a website built by bt they tied me up in a contract  the contract ended but i continued to pay and use their services i transferred the service and they continued to charge i cancelled and had to cancel via two separate departments and they refused to refund any money due to not informing them  it turned out that i was paying £36 a month for management fees that i did not need at all so bt have earned very nicely indeed i have also been paying £24 every quarter for hosting and required only hosting after the 1st year so yes bt was charging me £42 a month when i should have been paying only £6 a month when i phoned bt to cancel and bt said they want more money as notice is required  i said i will pay but will let everyone know what the bt corporation is like she said you are more than welcome to do that  so they are on bt gave me an 0800 number that linked to my mobile number but did not get missed calls or any answerphone so i missed out on customers bt gave me email addresses linked to my domain but was not able to setup the password and server details to access the emails so missed out on any emails sent to my advertised email addresses this was an ongoing issue with many calls bt deleted all my emails on their servers once i had transferred the hosting although i was still paying bt put the phone down on me when i asked them to look into whether they could retrieve my emails on their servers i know because they did not call back this is expected as i am a leaving customer bt purchased ee and without delay oranges reputation was gone  their customer service went down hill  trying to worm out of warranties and prices hiked bt said the website they created me was terrible and i needed to upgrade to £150 a month from £36 a year later when i made inquiries they said that the company they used is no longer trading and i did not get the upgrade at all  so they refunded the money back dated in summary bt are too large  too controlling  too financially focused and uncaring towards its customers they have the money for large advertising campaigns  to buy other companies out and to perfect contract termsconditions to their advantage they dont have the necessary knowledge to assist you with technical issues in fact i think a small claims court may get me several years of management fees

was their error and tried to tell us we were in a new contract as a result they really shouldnt have the name british in their title  they are a disgrace to this country ive had to spend countless hours on the phone to them  and with their overseas call centres getting anything done is nigh on impossible  assuminy you can actually understand the person you are talking to i will be ditching bt

available in 2015 i have no complaints at all performance has been fast and rock solid  although i have been using my own router rather than the bt hub customer service has been very good by phone and online chat the cost is on the high side but i am reluctant to switch to cheaper and probably worse competitors one last point  this is an honest review of my experience with  bt as a customer i have no oher relationship with the company', 'bt broadband the worst customer service ive ever experienced i signed up for bt tv and broadband having recently moved house  the installation was meant to be free but they charged me £59 called to complain and was told the refund would be in my account within 24 hours one week later had to call again as still no refund finally got that money back a few days later  on the day the installation was due to happen i didnt receive any communication so checked online and it showed the engineer was confirmed  just to be sure i used instant chat and was told the same thing the time slot came and went and the engineer never showed called to complain and was told they didnt know if i needed a new line so rather than check or ask they just cancelled the appointment i had waited 6 weeks for  decided 3 complaint calls was enough before even getting the service so decided to cancel the contract it then took a further 4 x 30min calls over 3 days for them to actually cancel  two weeks on i still havent received my refund for the engineer cost and have been charged a bill for a service i never received another two hours on the phone and many promises made and im still waiting for a refund  im sure the service is great if you ever get it but if you have a problem forget about it because noone there seems to be able to help they are very apologetic

bad until i switched to bt no wifi absolutely anywhere  be prepared to be charged over for your phone bills because youre going to need your data', 'it took years for this company to learn the lesson of having uk based call centres now it needs to stop spending vast sums on tv  advertising computerised answer systems and its preoccupation with the idea that all the customer wants is to watch sport especially soccer this company needs to invest in people to improve the dismal customer care they currently providei simply want to ring up  talk to a human who can provide the information or help required or connect me with another human who canunfortunately that would require an outbreak of common sense and upset the shareholdersthe company is  however  extremely adept when increasing the

job just by everything i experienced that i cant recommend anyone to bt this isnt the first time it is the fourth times this happening the first three was my internet being very slow but for every

the first month for calls made to poland which they failed to include in my misold package the usual messing around online and on the phone persued  and they then had to increased my package price to £4500 naughty naughty  to include the international calls which now tv actually provided for £3800 and which i was promised another week or two and i receive a letter in the post informing me of another price increase of up to around £5000 per month to keep my package again i complained and was told i could have my package frozen at £4500 if i renewed my contract naughty naughty after a long discussion with an adviser i was told that i was also actually paying for sport channels which i never asked for i took his advice and had the package changed yet again  and was fairly happy with the service at £4500 per month then my speed and connection problems came for another visit and i spent hours on the phone trying to sort it with another technical adviser it was found to be a faulty router which i was promised was the best thing since sliced bread when they missold me the original package a new router was sent and we all had fun resigning passwords once again then my next bill came in £6119 i was by this time furious and sent some choice word emails and once again messed around on the phone and online three times i was dis connected from a live chat and nobody wanted to help after blowing my fuse and making threats of desertion i was told sorry mr stephens but they have made a mistake with your call plan and have charged you for local and international calls they had also messed up in both june and july and simply added the extra cost to your new bill  but heres £700 back as a refundyeh right absolutely disgusting i have now cancelled my contract and moved on

bill would increase by £10 more i spoke to several customer service people and complaint was open long time ago with no resolution early last month one of their agents advised me that i have two separate accounts with bt one for mobile and one for land line and broadband if i merge these accounts my mobile data allowance will double up from 8 to 16 gb at no extra cost and he will also resolve billing issue for me again my mistake its been weeks neither my data has doubled up nor my billing has been resolved  my complaint was escalated to level 2 and i was told that they will sort it within 5 days yesterday on completion of 5 day deadline i spoke with bt and i have now been told that department is very busy and they dont know how long this will take to settle furthermore since merging two accounts extra services which are offered by the bt eg parental control  web protection have been locked and i am unable to make any changes to their settings  i have reported this issue to broadband tech support team separately on multiple occasions but in spite of their promises no one has been able to resolve this issue either it appears that departments are not talking to each other and they have a field team responsible to sort out some of the issues but other departments have no phone access to field team i feel so frustrated and angry with such poor customer experience and dont know where to go next all customer service advisors speak in a very polite manner and apologise for the inconvenience multiple times but no actions are taken to resolve the complaint no one is

end of september with one of their offers got an email confirming order a few weeks later when shouldve been installed nothing happened and nobody turned up they had lost the order which meant i had lost the special deal and price and they said more or less its hard luck i complained and eventually got the original offer and more with their top fibre optic broadband when it was all installed and up and running i couldnt believe that i had been paying skys high prices for so long because the broadband speed was brilliant for a short while and the tv was just what i wanted with a few extra channels and bt sport however  that feeling didnt last long the bttv box kept freezing between channels and had to be rebooted and reset every day i had my 5th tv box about a month ago but and its still rubbish the software has not been thought about properly and is not up to running the box numerous engineers have visited checking everything but nothing has really been accomplished fibre optic broadband started off good but then started dropping out numerous times every day bt say that up to 10 drop offs a day are acceptable normally  that wouldnt have been that much of a problem but because bt sport and the extra channelssyfy  fox  comedy central etc are received over the internet  it means that these are unavailable until broadband is back up and running it also means that if any of those channels are set to record during a drop out  then the recording fails many bt outreach engineer visits later and 3 replacement homehubs and the problem still occurs usually every afternoon for some reason i have spent tens of hours on the phone to bt support and have had a slight bit of compensation for one month a few weeks ago i decided that enough was enough and told bt that i wanted to be released from my contract because of their lack of service to me  and they agreed that they would not hold me to term but i would have to give them 30 days notice i gave them that notice verbally during that telephone call and they said they would confirm everything in writing soon after i then decided to join virgin media and agreed to an 18 month contract with their big kahuna bundle i got a letter a few days later stating i would have to pay bt an extra £101 pounds because i was leaving before the end of my contract i phoned them and explained that they had agreed to let me leave before the end of my contract but they said there is nothing on file about that i then asked that they should listen to the recording of the phone call when this was agreed unless it had conveniently been lost they said that if there is a dispute with this and the recording had gone missing then the decision will go with the customer  so i will have to wait and see what happens i cant say that i would recommend bt to anyone after my experience', 'after moving to a new  house this year my wife and i decided to give bt a try after leaving sky  however this wasnt quite as easy as first thought after three failed attempts to have the service installed and i dont know how many phone calls my wife had had enough  not only have we lost money for her taking time off work but left us without any broadband and phone  to add insult to injury they now want to charge me £170 for the pleasure after more lengthy phone calls to asian call centres who by the way lie through their teeth to try and resolve this issue they refuse to transfer me to anyone of seniority and hung up on me on more than one occasion when i did finally get through to a english call centre to explain we had cancelled the service before the 29 day period they apologised and offer £20 refund and would have packaging sent for the return of their equipment great no not so great this again was just another lie somore phone calls no notes on their system of previous calls and guess what yes another bill came through i am so livid with this company and would advise extreme caution should you chose to use them note names times and dates you call them because they dont for a big company the service is abysmal and they have caused massive stress to my pregnant wife and myself  this is to add to the loss of my mother to terminal cancer and my father in law suffering a massive stroke my account number isgb13404066 but expect this will be fully ignored as per previous attempts  oh and before we end this

have really poor signal due to the lack of fibre optic broadband  however this is being addressed by the government and openreach so it is a case of sitting tight and waiting customer service was very

recently  they were never able to deliver broadband for us  continued to bill us monthly after we cancelled our order and even threatened that our credit rating would be damaged if we didnt pay up  it

sales pitch for infinity their website is as unreliable as the rest of their internet services i have been trying to set up a secondary email for a family member its a relatively easy process if it were with any other provider but the bt website keeps crashing on the final page and  you guessed it  noone to fix the problem and im now on the fourth day of attempting it i have 8 months left on my

moved house  i called and went through the order process  and was advised that bt would sequester my existing number from talktalk and move the service across to coincide with my move in february 2015  cool  i paid a years line rental up front along with an extortionate connection fee and looked forward to my super fast internet and phone service the first red flag was when the engineer didnt turn up as booked  i called bt and was connected to their call centre in india  and was informed that the work had been carried out remotely and my service would be active before midnight  the following day i had a dialling tone result  however  when i called my home number the phone didnt ring  i call call out but couldnt receive incoming calls and the internet was slow   after many  many weeks of dealing with the same individual in india  i didnt request the same person  she was the only operative who ever answered the phone i was getting nowhere  then  out of the blue talktalk emailed me my latest bill   um how can this be when bt provide my service   well  it turned out that bt had never adopted the line but had partially switched it at the exchange  soooooo  when i called out it was with bt  but incoming calls were received via talktalkwait for it at my old house  isnt that brilliant  seriously  you cant make this stuff up   i called bt againand got through to the same person in india againand i explained the situation againand she promised me she would fix it again in fact she promised me she would fix it by the following day and then call me to make sure everything was working as it should be  no one called i called bt again and got through to the same person again  she told me she had actually tried to call me the previous day  but no one had answered   um because it didnt ring  that was the issue in the first place    this went on and on for months  me pleading  begging and eventually threatening them nodding  smiling and doing nothing eventually i did manage to get the phone issue sorted  but only after a very nice man at talktalk offered to contact bt and idiot talk them through the line transfer process  thank you talktalk  ill be back as soon as im out of contract anyway  to cut a long story shortish  its a year on  i now have phone service  but im paying for bt infinity whilst they provide regular broadband  aaaaand ive yet to receive the refund i was promised but its ok theyre working on it dont do it people  buy your broadband elsewhere  life is just too short', 'i would suggest that anyone thinking of using bt to avoid them like the plaque i have had sky and virginia before and have had much better service my experience with bt gas been bad from the start when i originally enquired they said set up was free and they would be out in a week to install  then after hearing nothing i phoned  to find out what was going on and they say they wouldnt be attending and it was going to cost me £150 to get install  after refusing to pay i get a phone call two weeks later to ask if i was interested in bt tv i explained what had happened and was informed i would not be charged  so i thought second chance and all that so i agree and went a head adding sky to the package two weeks after my box arrives for internet no sign of engineer so i phoned and they said that i would be charged and the engineer couldnt attend today  after complaint again two weeks after that they set up my internet  when i phoned again to say my tv box had not arrived they said you never had that package after complaining two weeks later i received a box which wouldnt work  i phoned to complain and they said my internet was not strong enough after further investigation from another department it turns out my signal was just fine and that they hadnt set it up or something  now after my many complaints and 7months of waiting and endless phone calls i had a manager phone to say i will give you £50 off of your first bill as a gesture of good will good will after all that i dont think so anyway after all that my first bill comes and states i owe £45 so i phoned and was told to ignore it even though they tryd to take it out of my bank   then again a letter comes through saying my bank has declined it twice and i will now be charged for this as well as so i phone again and get told i had to pay my next months bill a month in advance well as you can imagine i was not impressed  to also find out it will cost me over £50 pm so much for good will  i have hated the service provided by them they never gave me any compensation for everything i had been

suffered from drop outs and took my complaint to the highest level  when you do they then mess with your connection further as youve black listed and it would stop every so often   i work in the it industry so know how things run and often was told the problem was always in my end  ie home and not their network whilst i knew otherwise and fought them to address it  youre consistently threatened

converse with and on two occasions hung up on me no swearing or shouting either when you do complain this falls on deaf ears and the promised callbacks fail to be honored even when they send texts confirming the date and time as an organization they have become a joke in terms of customer service  even in a nonfault related manner there ordering process is a comedy of errors finally when bt stuffs up most major suppliers would offer a bit of compensation as a way of goodwill  however with bt you have to plead your case and when they finally pay out this is a computer calculated amount of a pittance that bears no relation to the stress you will have endured dealing with them if you can choose anyone other than bt i would advise you to seriously consider your health and mental sanity

did so they reinstated my order to cut  along story short i have no tv  no broadband and no landline as talk talk have now cancelled and bt cant do anything for anither week i am 20 days past the

find out what was going on 3 of them couldnt  the promise i will have tv tomorrow  but they promised this on tuesday but then sent me a text saying there was a technical fault  without doubt one of

service but believe me talktalk seems to be infinitely better than bt firstly we were left 1 week without internet connection at the switch a very poor standard of call centre customer service officer told us that the problem was the hub that they sent us they sent a second which also didnt work so an engineer was called who got us up and running it was not the hub at all unfortunately we now find that the speed is well below the talktalk speed we tried to move away from the final irony is that our internet speed is so slow that we cant even run the bt speed tester', 'for me now bt is a synonym

weeks and many hours of phone calls to get my broadband infinity connected as the original order was cancelled but the new order was not put in by the customer service assistant  they then charged a £130 connection fee even though i was an existing customer and again several phone calls to get my money back one of the calls lasted 2 hours and i was put through to 8 different people   absolutely appalling service i am now trying to upgrade my tv package and have been informed there is a fault on my account i was told last weekend after speaking to 3 different people that this would be fixed

this is resolved  hurry up virgin media in my area', 'i have recently found that my broadband speed was 05 meg per sec i made an effort to improve this by contacting bt they informed me that i could get 915 mbps i then went through the process of upgrading and was told that this would be completed by 180316 i called bt on 280316 to find out where my new hub was and that i hadnt seen any improvement with my broadband speed i was then told that i couldnt get anything better than 8mbps they also informed me that  there was no evidence of the order being place i have wasted several hours

service i made the mistake of leaving sky for bt in the hope of getting better broadband speed i ordered my package btinfinity and full tv bundle basically i seen a deal for bt package with 80mb

the bt to be installed on monday 21st march  a week before this date the engineer would be calling out to the cabinet to hook me up to infinity so before my engineer called out i just decided to log into mybt so see order progress if any and it said your order will be complete on thursday 24th march so i contacted them and they said it had been changed to 24th  nice of them to not email and let me know this i was also not even able to track the progress because it just keeps saying an error occurred so anyway my sky ended and because bt were going to be 3 days later than i booked i was going to be without any phoneinternet or tv service for 3 days then on thursday 24th the phoneline came back online but no internet i contacted them and after numerous times on hold and being blatantly hung up on i was told that the internet order had been canceled due to a mismatch in reference id  which apparently means the cabinet the engineer called out to has the old copper connector which cant be used for infinity  the girl said i might not be able to get infinity and they would update me on tuesday 29th march my semidetached next door neighbor has infinity and used the same cabinet so seems odd keep in mind the only reason i switched from sky was because i was told i could get infinity  which in my mind is basically false advertising so i am without internet for over a week so far and not knowing what service i will eventually end up paying for', 'worst service ever never had issues with sky router is rubbish  you cannot pick up a signal after a few metres  cannot use another router withit  tied to rubbish bt dns that keeps failing and technical support blame it on router or your computer  when it is obvious it is the bt dns that has gone down and then after lengthy phone call and escalation they finally admit the issue is at there end speed is on par with dial up on a bt infinity 1 contract with no fibre running into home so no fibre only copper missold then you call

on validating who you are  rather than resolving the problem i mean who in their right mind would pretend to be someone else  and put themselves through the pain that this so called support service involves without boring about details  i usually sit down with a magazine or such  because on average i spent over an hour  and most of that was just that  waiting occasionally getting responses such as hold on a minute or the server for that test is taking time or im just checking into that they are very good at apologising though i got that a lot what has pushed me over the edge is being lied to by these people ive got transcript evidence of 2  arguably 3 instances in less than a week where promises to email or call me back simply have not happened  when it got to the point of agreeing an

in a threatening manner i firmly advised i will not be paying any extra to get the service i am now paying for id add that the previous bb service i was buying never managed 75% of its so called

very poor broadband connection typically less than 4 mbps download and 044 mbps upload when bt upgraded their tv service it became unuseable as the new service requires a fast broadband connection i now have a sky tv subscription as a result of this i am now going to completely bin bt phone line  phone  broadband  tv  sports  the works and move over to sky for broadband and phone as well as tv it will work out about the same total price including my current sky tv subscription as i am currently paying these shysters £34 per month alone  on an abysmal unlimited broadband service at least by using sky they will be able to put pressure on these incompetents to maximise the performance of my current line i will then try to get sky to apply pressure to get fibre installed my area is served

overall 3 stars  it should be much lower  and you should give a 0 option just for bt ive used them a couple of times now and each time their service  broadband and reliability is subpar in comparison to other providers however  this occasion takes the biscuit the most unreliable service ive ever used  extremely slow and cutting out several times a day for several hours at a time so this means they are only providing working broadband service to their consumers for a few hours each day  yet charging full prices they should be heavily regulated to ensure they are providing their customers with service they advertise  or be fined', 'we moved to a remote part of warwickshire 4 weeks ago so wasnt expecting great speeds bt took 2 weeks to connect us it ran for 4 days then went down on the 9th

customer for years so when we moved in our new flat this month  we decided to use the bt broadband services however  the line came on and off all the time in the first three days so we called to cancel the order their customer service team sounded very nice and asked us to give another chance for them to investigate  so we did we arranged a follow up call on the following day and specified due to our working hours we could only receive calls in early mornings so their team did call back a few times but when we were at work so we missed all the calls  and there was no number for us to call back therefore we tried to call back again to cancel the order  then we were told the 14 days free cancellation had been passed counting from the day we placed order then we spent altogether 5 hours calling their teams and got the answer that we either paid a £350 cancellation fee  or waited at home for an engineer to come over to check whether it can be fixed but again during our working hours i am very surprised by their tactics and attitude to deal with their customers in this way', 'bt is the worst company i have ever had to deal with i have taken out a contract for fibre optic

phone centre staff in india are beyond useless they refuse to cancel the contract until the internet is connected i dont know why  but cant tell us when it will happen  but will charge us if we do then cancel so we are stuck with no internet  no tv and can only buy ourselves out of the contract when if they finally do manage to connect us the also refuse to set up a temporary nonfibre internet connection to keep us going the attitude is  we have disconnected you and theres nothing you can do about it  we are not going to help out in any way all or bother to find out what is going wrong  we are not even going to bother contacting you to let you know there is a problem  you will have to spend an hour of your own time on hold waiting to speak to us  and we will then tell you that we wont

assistant constantly interrupted it turns out i was right no apology from the person i spoke to and no follow up from a complaint i made about over charging there is a reason bt has such poor reviews

send us a bill for a years contract because we cancelled it went to the ombudsman and they were useless after investigating the matter for three months they told us that bt have to apologise for the time lapse without contacting us but that we will still have to pay the bill bt did not issue the apology to us but the ombudsman sent us a copy of the one that was apparently issued to them bt are a

supposedly fix my issue which they assured me would be deleted and then started to charge me for it oh and they cant cancel it straight away for some unknown reason some of there customer non service team are polite but most are rude and dont listen to you they call you back at the wrong times they cut you off they put you on hold for 10 minutes you try their live chat and they fix the problem yeah oh maybe not they lie to you saying your problem is fixed as it is still there the next day have i mentioned that they lie they say your issue is now solved can we close the complaint you say yes thanks for solving my problem the next day the issue is still there never ever close a complaint until you are sure it is done otherwise you start all over again in the last couple of months i have spoken to bt more than my friends and family and my issue is not resolved if you enjoy pain in your life then sign up for bt broadband if i could give 0 marks i would when my switch is complete i am going to smash all there equipment up and post it to them oh and because it was a nightmare joining bt i have 4 sets of stuff they messed up my order so badly  they kept cancelling it and doing another order so i ended up with 4 sets bt are incompetent idiots i feel much better after that', 'ridiculous i placed a business order with bt over 2 weeks ago when i was placing the order and they were agreeing to take my money they were more than happy to tell me that my order will be completed and fitted within 10 working days so 10 working days went by and nothing  so i rang bt myself to find out what was going on and i was told they were waiting to do a credit check  so why did nobody contact me to do this  i had to ring bt myself to do the credit check  now all of that has been done  here i am again nearly 3 weeks later and im still waiting  i am literally on hold to bt while i am writing this review  the order has still not gone through how ridiculous and disgusting is this that nearly 3 weeks after i placed my order that it still has not even been put through  this is an order for a business line  so the amount of money that is slipping by me because my customers cannot call or email me because i have no internet is ridiculous i cannot believe that bt can be so unprofessional  especially when it comes to handling their business customers  how can you allow my business to suffer the way that it is and you are doing nothing about it i cannot believe how ridicules bt have been  its my own fault for choosing such a company', 'this is by far the worst company that i have

aggravating if i could have given zero stars i would have  now i dont want to bore you with specifics of my case  so if you arent interested skip over this paragraph after bt hiked their prices again the second time in 12 months i phoned up to cancel  which they assured me would be free as they had broken their side of the contract lo and behold they tried to charge me the cancellation fee oh sorry our prices are extortionate  please before you go we can offer you the absolute worst deal we have for double the money of our competition not interested well thatll be £31 for the privilege of taking your business elsewhere i explained that they had broken contract so i shouldnt be charged  and they said that they had sent the letter out weeks before i had received it an argument happened  they refused to do anything long story short i left bt paying the fee jokes on them though  as a landlord i manage multiple properties  all of which used to be with bt now none of them are was only going to change one house estimated loss to bts business  16 x 52 x 12  £9 984 per year amount gained in cancellation fees 16 x 31  £496 honestly even if they offered me the service for free  i wouldnt go with them not worth the hassle', 'i would give bt 0 stars if possible they have quite possibly the worst customer service team possible after refusing to cancel my account they still continued to charge me up to 15 pounds per month for an account i did not want i am unsure of this is borderline theft however i am appalled at the provided services an email i cannot access  overly excessive monthly charges for a limited email account  no accessible customer services team able to cancel a simple email account  do not sign up', 'i wouldnt recommend bt to anyone as they are very

have been a bt customer for only a couple of months and i have had the worst customer experience of my life after signing up for their deal with a usage cap  i was unable to log in to my bt email account because of an error message  which meant i did not receive any emails about my usage so my bill was £100 for 1 month after wasting hours of my time on the phone trying to fix my email over 34 weeks they have still not fixed the error message in the meantime i upgraded to infinity and the representative even said to me that it was the end of his shift as an excuse as to why his system was failing to accept my email address format when upgrading in the end he was laughing at the system because he knew how dumb it is the residential team even referred me onto the business team to fix the email issue  to which the business team joked back at me saying how dumb the residential team are at referring them on to the wrong team in the end i have received a total of approximately 1015 calls

annoyed and helpless', 'a service i would not recommend to anyone in my right mind really early on we started having connectivity issues the wifi would appear to be connected although there was no internet there we have since started contacting bt a nightmare to get to talk to someone but i guess that you would expect from a large company and it would be ok if you get a solution to the problem however  the people in customer service although very polite they have been unable to identify the problem and provide a solution to it has always been turn your modem off  turn it on again  oh it is working now has it been a faulty modem device issue from the very beginning we will never get to know the bottom line is that after so many phone calls  effort to get help and patience no solution has been offered  bearing in mind that i wouldnt mind paying for a repair if someone would check and suggest a specific one it is a very poor service provided whilst bt keeps increasing their monthly fee

for a further 30 days despite me not requiring internet after moving out last year when i rang bt i was told to ring back within 30 days of moving out to cancel the service  not that i need to give 30

job  which included leaving dangerous splines outside my front door almost two weeks on from the 2nd engineer company around  i am still awaiting it to be resolved im having to call them to chase it up  as i keep getting told that someone will call back within a certain time period and no one does  all being one person i have made countless calls  time  and am still being told that someone will

brainer and i signed up straight away i was told theyd be a one off fee of £8999 which i paid instantly not thinking anything of it then the women on the phone told me they wouldnt be coming to install this and went onto inform me they couldnt guarantee the delivery date and said itd actually be £49 a month rather than £46 so at this point i asked to speak to a manager and explained id be reserving my right to cancel with immediate effect i was then informed they would trigger a refund and that id have it within 7 working days i assumed that was it  that id never have any dealings with this lot again ive never been more wrong in my life this is where the shambles and blatant lies really started after 7 days no money was in my account  i phoned up and after been put on hold for a ridiculously long amount of time this would become a very recurring theme i was then informed it was actually within 14 working days and that i would receive my money then id also like to add the operator was damn right rude and selfrighteous then after a further 7 days i looked in my account and shock horror there was refund in there i called up again  took ages to get through  got put on hold for ages as normal this time i was informed theres been a problem with the system the refund hasnt been triggered and that id receive my money back within 14 days after 14 further days i found again no money was in my account so again i called up and again i explained the situation this time i was put on hold for even longer and given the usual line of well try and find out whats happened this time the operator who again couldnt hide the fact she couldnt care less informed me that theyre were no details of me on the the system id been amazingly patient up until the point  so at this stage i told them in no uncertain terms id been stolen off and lied to she then somehow managed to find details and gave me the party line of ive triggered the refund and youll receive the money within 14 days it may shock you to know that after 14 days again it hasnt arrived its now been well over a month and as you can guess i called up again to find out why as usual the operator on the phone was rude and asked me not to be angry if you can believe it she then did some digging  put me on hold for a record of 15 minutes she then told me it would be within 10 working days i said no im not having this put me onto a manager immediately she took a further 8 minutes to manage this he then spoke to me saying he was very sorry etc  that hed got all the details of previous calls up on screen that none of them had triggered my refund properly because the account was closed i explained to him id been lied to on a few occasions and asked why it was just such a problem to pay me now on the day i signed up  they had no issues removing the money at all he just kept apologising before  eventually saying hed send a cheque in the post with a final bill and refund id argued and argued to no avail ive lost even more money to them in phone bills but im not giving up on it its caused a huge amount of stress i really dont need in my life at the moment since all this ive signed up to

through the cycle of indians people i sincerely cannot understand and wait three weeks for an engineer this time however i was greeted by a decent sounding guy called liam  who clearly lived in the uk these people do not want to help you at all they are working for probably nextto minimum wage pressing buttons trying to fob people off absolutely atrocious service it took 510 minutes of tests and stuff just for this man to tell me everything looked okay  but when i argued with him and asked surely you can see my connection dropping on your screen his reply was just yes  i can soon after this

attacks today  cried a lot and spent 4 hours on the phone and on online chat to your advisors the service i have received is absolutely disgusting i cannot believe the customer service team at such a big firm is so useless and incompetent it all started when i wanted to submit an order for moving home my address was not on the list so i had to do it over the phone after waiting an insane amount of time i was redirected 56 times to different teams finally  it seemed like i am seeing light at the end of the tunnel a very nice lady promised me she submitted my order and that she booked in an engineer for 2nd jan this was not ideal for me but it was the best they could do she also assured me my new address has the fiber service available at this point i thought it was done after not receiving an email with my order for 15 mins i decided to check my online account surprise  the offer said rejected i immediately called again this time it only took 29 minutes to reach the correct team we started again with the order  it turned out my new flat does not have fibre and would not be able to transfer my current broad band and tv package the lady suggested some other options which were available  at this point i agreed to anything i was crying on the phone and i just wanted to sort things out she then says my engineer appointment would now be 9th jan at this point i was breaking down  this meant i could not work for an extra week i use wifi for my job i had no other option  i had to agree she then put me on hold and the waiting began once again after long 17 minutes she says im sorry but it appears i cannot submit this order  i really have no idea why as you can imagine  the 9th of jan slot now seemed like a dream  it seemed like even in february i will not have internet this was my breaking point and i decided to cancel my contract all together the assistant told me since you can no longer provide me the same services at my new home i will be able to cancel free of charge with a 30 day notice period this meant i would pay some extra weeks but i didnt care we agreed the services will stop on 2 jan and i will pay until 12 jan she told me its done and wished me to feel better i think she actually really felt bad that i was crying because of the obvious incompetency of these peopleafter the call i was beginning to calm down the contract was cancelled so i went ahead and arranged another firm i was scrolling through my emails when i saw my confirmation of stopped services i was relieved i did not want to even open the email  i had such hatred in my head still but i opened it  and almost had a heart attack the email said my services will stop on 20th december not only that but as a christmas present maybe i had to pay almost £700 imagine my shock immediately  for the 16th time that day i connected to the online chat of course they couldnt help because i needed the fttf team and so the waiting to connect to this magical team began once again this one was actually not too bad  only 14 minutes i gave my details and the agent said she will check in a minute and come back once again i had entered the dangerous game of being on hold at one point i considered hanging up but i decided to persist after 20 minutes of checking my account she came back to say she could not amend this order and has no idea why it went wrong the solution is to cancel the order which will take two days and then on saturday when she is back in office she will try to resubmit the order i had no option so  have to trust that she will do thatin the meantime i am left with an incredible amount of stress  i still do not know what will happen and i am disgusted with the treatment i have received i am still shaking and crying  i am as helpless in this situation as useless are your employees i am now actually considering becoming a bt employee only to be able to fix my issue  i didnt know where to start and i do not know where to end i guess

a couple of hours later and did something to the socket in the flat then went out to the box on the street  a couple of hours later come back in saying fault on line and while most of this sorted out  they needed access to a communal cupboard which i didnt have access to so an appointment would be arranged  heard nothing back again the next day so contacted and was told nothing had been arranged  they made arrangements while i was on phone to come back and told me explicitly that i didnt need to be in  that they needed access to communal cupboard and this would be sorted by them  come home to find a missed appointment card i didnt have a missed appointment and called and was told id have active services by midnight i tried explaining situation to be told that the line would be active and not to worry  the line was not active the next day  called back and was told that an engineer needed access to the communal cupboard  i explained the situation again and so a date was set for a week despite me explaining my autistic son was staying for weekend and the issues this would cause  the advisor did send me money to pay for a mifi device but the data on this was eaten within a night    today was the date the engineer was sorting out whatever needed sorting in the communal cupboard  had a number of missed calls i was in training and when i called back engineer said he couldnt access my flat  i explained yet again that i was not asked to be in the flat  that they just needed access to the cupboard to be told that there wasnt an issue with anything in the cupboard  the fault was within the flat that the first engineer had come in and apparently sorted  he said to call bt and rearrange another appointment  i contacted bt and while helpful and friendly  the customer service advisor told me they openreach had me down as missed appointments and as such the next appointment they would be able to set was for the 27th its the 11th today  despite my protests  explaining that none of this was my fault  she was unable to do anything about it   the issue has been poor communication all the way through  and to be told im being noted as at fault when ive been told i dont need to be at the flat for the appointment is just plain ridiculous   as i think someone else said  one star is still way to high a rating for a shambolic experience  the only positives i can think of is

having agreed the upgrade i asked the question about whether this was a new contract  to which the answer was yes i cancelled it there  then as i only have 4 months left on my current contract  feel its a complete con  to start another 12 month contract  especially when i found out only by asking the questioni am an existing bt customer  would stay  but my current view is that i will now move', 'been with bt for years  very reliable service paying for up to 8 mg  never had better than 35  they are now advertising up to 20  i feel that i am paying for this but not close to getting any improved servicespeed  paying for unlimited download  had 3 teenagers home from uni at christmas  got fair useage warnings threatening to slow my download speed  how much slower can it get   bills are useless  no idea what im paying for  just know that it is costing over £50month for broadband phone line and calls  all on the cheapest rate   overall view  they are ripping me off and hiding it in confusing bills etc', 'ihave had this package for six weeks it has been unavalable on three occations for up to three days the current speed is 594% less than is avalable in my area the only thing that has been reliable is the apologies from there helplines i have a contract for 1 year i hope the next 11 months sees a vast improvement', 'the broadband speeds were originally terrible 30kbps for downloading files upload speed and 1mbps for browsing download speed but have now increased to 250kbps upload and 15mbps download these speeds are currently a lot less than bt state  also the spees drops during large file transfers their customer service is terrible when we called the helpline all the said was we cannot help they wanted to sell us bt vision by phone  it was an incovinient time  so we told them to call back later  they never did', 'speed has dropped from a download of 182mps to 03mps and bt helpdesk insist thisis because of distance from the exchange  31km as an bt pensioner

another isp bt cantwont fix this problem for us the india call centre have no clue full stop engineers keep saying its a software problem with bt wholesale but india call centre keep sending engineers to propertyexchange to perform the same checks over and over again we could dl at 45meg then dropped overnight to 05meg we cant move forward past the same processes india technical support is the worst  only web based compliants proceedures available and no one calls you about your complaint you get an automated email and you are left to be worn down and give up by the india call centre', 'been with them for three weeks and to say im disappointed is a understatement its like dial up very poor', 'although living less than a mile from the adsl2 enabled exchange bt say 69 mbs is about my limit and supplying me with a 20mb line is pointless all the shouting from bt about rolling out new high speed services seems somewhat over enthuisiastic', 'most frustraing customer experience of my life i pay for 8 meg and last year suddenly started getting below 1 meg 6 months  3 new hubs  countless hours wasted complaining and looking for imaginary faults with my computer and equipment  and many engineers visits later  i am still told that they can find no problem and it must be my fault words cant describe my utter contempt and loathing for their company sickening', 'extremely frustrating experience  speed drops frequently  customer service is run out of india bt should be a flgship britih provider  but they are sadly lacking in all areas of cstomer satisfaction', 'well  15 weeks into contract and issues still not resolved and eventually they have the cheek to say they will now let us cancel our contract  first two weeks no service at all and they said we must have set it up wrong so had to take half day off work to wait for engineer to call  the engineer confirmed it was their fault as they had set it up wrong at the exchange this was supposedly corrected  still no broad band tv channels after fix was applied  was then told it was a line speed issue and ours wasnt fast enough to receive the required channels  two days later was told it was a line capacity issue and the fix would be applied in a weeks time the week passed and no fix was applied  will skip the rest but 15 weeks later received a call to say the actual issue was one of their engineers had connected the wrong cables at the exchange and the fix was now in place great ill watch the channels i want  sadly not after resetting all the kit for some reason all our services had now disappeared so the fix actually made the appalling service even worse  in total 15 days off work for engineers  15 hours on the phone to overseas call centres and still not the service we are paying for they have the cheek to offer £30 compensation which i promptly told them where to put it  i want a full refund as ive never received the service i paid for  steer well clear of bt appalling customer service and incompetent in every area', 'very unhappy have complained now three times  wish i could take legal action as they are taking fees under false pretences am not receiving service paid for and then

minutes when watching a programme  download speed  takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour instead of  couple of minutes when is bt going to change the cable to better cable to carry the information that broadband requires i have infinity 2 i do not recommend it not reliable to expensive', 'bt is terrible their customer service is appalling and none of them know what they really talking about so far i have spoken to bt pretty much every day for the past two weeks and been given 45 different excuses as to why my account isnt active the latest one was because they have cancelled my order due to difficulties i am still waiting for a callback from them from a week ago from their complaints department surprise surprise absolutely shocking company how they have business i dont know', 'poor poor poor please do not use bt i started a deal 4 years ago £5month since then ive had poor costumer service  poor phone and broadband connections  have had previously free packages added to my bill and

its all in the terms and conditions im looking to leave as my contract ends next month but i have to give them 30d notice to leave or 14d notice to switch suppliereven though my contact ends in 2 weeks anyway apparently thats in the terms and conditions also  even though i wont be in contact anymore summarydo not use bt', 'worst company ever staff dont know what is doing on  they are rude  they are clueless  plain stupid  too expensive for what its worth  constantly getting things wrong so overcharged so glad my contract ended this month', 'having believed what i was told on the phone i placed an order for fibre broadband  home phone and three mobile sims the sims arrived the next day and i set mine up number transfer happened the following day and caused 34 hours of no service it was then that i discovered that basic functionality was not supported as an iphoneipad user  tethering devices is a way of life bt disable itvisual voicemail either was not set up or is also not supported so if you have devices you expect to share connection with  bt refuses to enable this i discovered the lack of this basic feature whilst out on business calls  i had explained i needed this when ordering  caused me to need to change mobile provider when i phoned to cancel 5 days after order i was told i could not have a pac code to move my number unless i could quote the account number but email was on ipad and i could not tether to connect i drove to a wifi hotspot  located account number and called back  this new contact said  sorry to hear you need a pac  but issued it without needing an account number so now i had been lied to twice it has taken another six calls to try and cancel the order every time my new provider tries to take on the service they are blocked by bt saying they have a live order in summary  do not believe anuthing they say  their customer service  although polite is useless as what they promise does not get done and as for their automated call answer service  there is no polite way to describe it avoid them  use any other company  dont put yourself through the pain', 'worst customer survice ever dont move to bt u will have to call them up a least 8 times before the job gets done', 'i furthered a query i made last week  about new contract i spoke to a very helpful man  who sorted my problem immediately and told me to then check my e mail  sure enough if was there explain g exactly the terms of my new contract  i couldnt fault the cstomer service ', 'do not use bt this year was the first time that i have used bt for my broadband services and i completely regret it customer service is useless  you have to bug them over and over again to get anything done and it takes on average 1020 minutes to get through to them they made mistakes which led to me having issues and even my installation was delayed multiple times they charge you for anything and everything and even the cancellation fees are more than with any other company i will never use bt again and definitely recommend sky or virgin over them', 'i switched from sky to bt a month ago and deeply regret it bts superfast fibreoptic achieves a miserly 51 mps broadband speed  despite their advertised speed of 23 mps guaranteed to 52 mps this speed is too slow for hd viewing of my chosen channels bt admits the fault is at our end     and are working on it what a ripoff', 'i ordered services from bt and was told the order had failed on their system so they cancelled and told me they would raise again i then received a call saying they where sorry i hadnt completed my order their system said it had been cancelled and not re ordered this is against what i had been told previously i then stayed with my current supplier however my credit card showed a charge from bt i called and they have said it will be refunded they also said i had an active account but would not give me any details as i dont have the account number i have not received any paperwork from bt after being told the order was cancelled the agent i spoke with would not help without me giving them the account number which i dont have he then became rude when i asked to speak to a supervisor and refused to transfer me he just said he would post the account number and i had to call back i have spent enough time on the phone with bt and cant believe how unhelpful and how much of a mess they have caused and stress for me on not knowing if i will lose my services i am also concerned they may try to charge me and it may effect my credit score as i have cancelled the dd i have not received any services from them and refuse to pay for their errorsi have never felt the need to escalate an issue but this time is different this is the worst service i have ever encountered', 'overall worse provider ever worse in everything', 'we had a very reliable bt service until the end of march when we received a communication the exchange had been upgraded   since then

making you go through the same procedures time after time  there is nothing wrong with your line  we may have to charge you  what about any compensation due from  bt for the inconvenience and frustration experienced  it is time bt came into the 21st century  we are not all touching our fetlocks saying yes master   do something  even if we live in a rural area we should not be treated like this', 'so bt have provided me with 500gb of free cloud storage  great however  why cant bt provide customers with a user guide that is usable to explain how to setup  configure their cloud solution a

hour theyve also signed me up to bt sport for free initially  then started charging me for it they said they informed me by email  but i receive an email from bt every couple of weeks that contains nothing but spam and so i happened to miss this  which they blamed me for  please please please  do whatever you can to avoid them', 'absolutely absurd to think i get 19mb speed  i spoke to bt just before buying my house 2 years ago and they assured me that works were due to take place to install fibre optic  not a single sign of an engineer  every time i call im told its due to take place in 34 months  if i visit my brother in law who lives literally the other end of my road and use his wifi  i get 5560mb speed  its an utter disgrace  not only are they liars  their customer service is diabolical and i cross my fingers that this new law gets passed where customers have to have a minimum broadband speeds bt hang your heads in shame  yours sincerely a soon to be ex customerpa dial up

bill for the service the speed averaged 3mbps though this could occasionally drop as low as 025mbps when i complained about the speed i was told i could upgrade to infinity for an additional  £20 a month £57 a month for a decent internet connection is a lot so i declined when cancellingafter contract had ended  i was hit by a hidden cease charge of £31 at no point during the sign up was i told about this charge  even although i specifically asked for a break down of all costs the sales team conveniently omitted this fact what is the purpose of this charge to me  it seems like bt are on a last rob before i finally leave them i would 100% recommend you avoid this company until they get their act together and provide a reliable  fast and transparent service', 'absolute garbage customer

werent happy  phoned today 17516 which is 10 days after we became active only to be told that we cant cancel as we are out of our 10 days period from the date we ordered  we wasnt told any of that

 no word  so i called bt i got cut off twice i spoke to one person  had to be transferred  then got cut off again when i finally got to speak to someone  they said the job had been closed  no body was working on they said they would get an engineer out to me on the 24th august i also asked this person  and i was very clear about this  asking if i cancelled with bt today  would i be subject to any charges  cancellation fees or do i need to give any notice for the cancellation of my account they said no  because i was out of my bt contact fixed date i made it very clear  regarding not only cancellation charges  any other charges  they said no the couldnt fix the problem on the 24th  and had to come back again on the 25th this time  the engineer actually fixed it but the engineered told me there was no fault and i had actually been cut off from bt broadband he told me he didnt know how this had happened as no problems were shown with my account i asked them if i can get compensation

only get remuneration from the 2nd august as this is when she believed i first reported the fault  when in fact this was the 23rd july i got a call back on 29th august from a was very rude agent i asked to speak to his manager he said he was the manager later it came out in he does have a manager  furthermore  i then found out from the cancellation team that if i cancel i will be charged £30

not in a position to give information on this  they should not have advised if i had been given the correct information in the first place  i would have said to the engineer to just keep me

helpful  she explained there was a fault on the fibre line which is why it wasnt activated on that day she explained that it was scheduled for 2 weeks time and she would look to expedite the date and contact me on the following monday unfortunately i had missed the call on the monday  so i called back in and spoke to another gentleman who told me that he could not do anything about the date and

informed if i did change i would be charged almost £320 in cancellation fees despite the fact i cancelled within the 14 days and bt had failed to fulfil their part of the agreement when i rang the

for the past month trying to chase down our order to see if any developments are taking place we have been redirected countless times and told that we would receive a phone call from their offline specialist team over and over again countless times we have received one phone call from the offline teams which came two weeks after we initially noticed that something is not right the offline team couldnt help us at all and made us wait over 7 business days for their follow up phone call only to be told that our phone line is already working and that they cannot find our address on their database to organize the broadband over there seems to be no consistency in their companywide customer service as every time we called confused wondering where our broadband is  no one had any idea what was going on with our case  forcing us  the customer  to explain our situation to countless customer service agents over and over again this company had the audacity to shamelessly take 7 business days to get back to us every time we called to make an inquiry on our order  and insisted time after time that our totally functionless and mute phone line is working  even after we bought a phone specifically for testing our phone line this company couldve been honest with us from the beginning and told us they cannot deliver us services as our address doesnt exist in their database but no this company could have some sort of basic high priority policy for customers that have had their unresolved case dragged out for weeks in order to speed up the process but no this company could add details of progression in their customer service systems so that when we call  our server could easily check the developments of our order on their on systems however  this utterly disfunctional and unacceptably disrespectful scam that bt calls a company has failed to do any of the above  or anything else for that matter to assist us even on our final phone call to them which cost us £8  the customer service agent had nothing else to say besides why didnt you use a phone box to call us to avoid spending so much money we have finally cancelled our order and are absolutely mortified over being totally scammed and had our time and money wasted for an entire month now we are eagerly awaiting our refund which will hopefully arrive in 510 business days', 'please avoid this vile company

subscribe a contract stating prices will increase and promising me i will not pay any money until the activation date further to that  i tried to postpone my activation date but  despite this changed on their website  i did not receive a confirmation and i decided to contact them they assured me the activation was postponed but  when i messaged them on facebook  they told me it was not also  i discovered they issued a bill and started debiting before the service was activated i chatted with them but they refused to deal with my complaint and transferred my call to people who transferred my call to other people and so on every time  they just told me please  ignore the bill of course  as i did not want to pay for something that has never been activated  i asked them to cancel my order  close the account and cancel the bill they cancelled the order but my account is still open and there is a message stating i will receive my first bill despite i have chatted and phoned them many times explaining this situation  they refused to deal with it they told me my account is closed when it is open and i can access to it they told me i will not receive any bill when there is a bill in

supposed to be set up and even received a confirmation text that our engineer was arrivingseeing a bt van on the road with a man looking confused i went outside and spoke to him the engineer was only there to install a line outside  i spoke to this man who was confused with conflicting information and after several calls it turns out we hadnt been informed our account was on hold  despite confirmation that day and they had the wrong property details due to the initial person who set us up writing our details incorrectly since the engineer was here he checked and the line which was apparently in use was perfectly fine and only needed to be turned on he also informed me that if someone had left the line open they can infect kick them off  he had no idea why i was told that and he

wait until tomorrow so they could find out what was wrong we called back tomorrow to sort out the issue  they told us they never give compensation and cannot authorise a months free broadband they told us we could intact get an expidited engineer as we have been waiting so long   nobody came  we rang up  they informed us the order for an expidited engineer was rejected  despite recieving confirmation they put in another request and we had to wait a few days again  of course this was then rejected again  we were informed expidited engineers only get out through if the delay is their

it was fixed it clearly wasnt rang again on hold for 45 minutes cut off rang again was promised a call back no call back rang again they told me it should be working no rang again cut off rang again

bt might sit up and listen  but with so many terrible reviews they cant care at all ive just spent ages on the phone again trying to get fibre optic installed in our home  and i could hear loads of

the beginning of july the lady on the phone said it would be installed two weeks later and gave me a date and time  i stressed that i would have to take time off of work and get staff in  so would be costly to me so i wanted to know someone would definitely turn up having been let down so many times before by bt on our business line naturally nobody arrived  no phone call  only the equipment was delivered as promised numerous phone calls and ten weeks later ive just called them again two weeks after the promised return phone call from them that never happened this time i have been told that there is a fault with two packages being on the account one the old copper and one the new fibre  but i should be pleased because i am only paying for one even though the fibre hasnt been installed

rates and frankly not worth a penny but apparently that is our fault for living in a rural area so  the outcome  a complaint has been raised again  and the issue has been escalated again it is in

line proved to be a long and frustrating process as i was told to contact them when the fault was present and then they can do a line test contacting them between 9 and 10pm proved to be impossible as i could be on hold for as long as 45 minutes before being disconnected  this was the case from january to may 2017 i also purchased the latest smart hub from bt but was left with same problemdesperate

again  did not receive a call80817 intermittant service90817 a 7pm speed  test with both netflix and bt wholesale  gave speeds of 5 and 10mbps still not received the promised call from bti would like to stress that the above is only a small fraction of the telephone conversations i have had with bteach time i contact bt they try to convince me that this is an isolated fault but everyone i have spoken to in the arnside area has been having exactly the same internet problems with bt infinity i have also been offered a partial refund by a gentleman called joseph which turned out to be a credit for a product that is not fit for purpose as bt are unable or unwilling to deal with the poor internet performance i intend to change my internet supplier as i cannot spend any more time on this farcical situation  and think it is not unreasonable to receive a full refund for a service contract i signed up to but have never received  further information as requested18082017 bt daniel phoned at 2000hrs and asked if the problem was solved i informed him the evening fault was no more but now i am only receiving a constant 27mbps  not the minimum 34mbps as advertised he also admitted as i had previously had daytime speeds of around 36mbps there was no reason they could not be achieved now he then arranged an engineers visit for 21082017 when the engineer arrived his instrument showed a speed of 29mbps but said he could not investigate further as bt had told him 24mbps was acceptable  i was shown and read this communication from bt the same day i logged on to the bt website which stated if i signed another contract with them they calculated i would receive a minimum of 36mbps to 49mbpsthis is a good and typical example of bt i have personally witnessed many test results at my property only to be told a completely different reading days later by bti would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your efforts on my behalf but i do not expect a result in my favour as i do not expect an accurate record of events from bt  this being my conclusion after months of dealing with this company', 'i joined bt because they had an infinity fiber deal before the end of the contract i had to change my address and called bt to transfer my broadband to the new address they told me that at the new address i cant get infinity fiber  although fiber was available at the new address  they just had two same flat numbers on their website and mixed the address up they attracted me into a copper broadband contract with slow speeds  promising that when fiber will be available i will be upgraded with no extra cost now they want me to pay extra if i want infinity fiber had a lot of phone calls and chats with their customer service but they failed to solve my problem you talk to them and then nothing happens  the problem persists once they trap you in a contract you are just a good cash machine for them unreliable broadband and service and the worst customer service i have ever experienced in my life never again bt this is my experience with them', 'i am very disappointed with their servicejoined them a month agothey messed it up before we joined them and now not even a month after we have no internet at all called them a few times and it is like i am talking to a robot computer says no and been advised that it will take 3 days to sort the faultit is the second day today no feedback at all such a crucial time with no internet as it has messed up my daughters homeworksbesides all thiese problems i joined them as they had an offer to get a reward card but now they refuse to give me my reward card', 'i am speechless and so very angry about bt  it must be the worse service inn every aspect i have ever had the missfortune to experience in my entire life ', 'i could write pages of frustrating rants here  but i dont want to relive it all in short it took me over 18 months to finally get the billing and bb sorted to the original request it has cost me a

told that canrefunds promised on purchase never materialisedthey put things on your bill without telling you eg bt sport then insist that i requested it and wont refundwere charging for an old bt

drops out but am told to reset and there are no faults on the linemix this with long delays waiting for customer service  poor assistance when you get someone  do yourself a favour and find another company', 'broadband deteriorated so called bt after doing a speed test myself told it was my old hub which wax out of warranty good news i was almost out of contract so could get a new deal with new hub probably cheaper than current contract great transferred to sales my contract was actually had over another year to run and my hub was in warranty transferred back to faults who had misinformed me as they could send me a new hub free of charge great they would only send next version on complaining they agreed to send latest smart hub to arrive in a few days email confirmation tells me my order is heading for someone elses address i ring and have another 2 hours on phone its a system fault apparently they place another order to my address to arrive today email tells me its on its way for delivery it never arrived i contact on line help get transferred from order management team to technical team and back to order management who then hang up on my account are 3 orders for smart hubs but who has then i wonder cos lets face it its not me do i contact bt tomorrow for another round of complaints and 2 hours of my life i wont get back if this is a quality service for the £37 i pay each month then who are they kidding', 'avoid bt  unfortunately  during a move of house i wanted a better wireless router and used the opportunity to move to bt the smart hub 6 is the worst router ive used  ive had three of them and they reboot at least twice a day  not great when streaming my tv via the wifi i got a hub 4 and the reboots never occurred  but the signal was awful due to the very low spec of this  the bt customer service experience was horrendous  clueless and all they ever wanted to do was run a line test  despite the fault clearly being with the router every call with them was at least 45 mins  same crap on every call still trying to break out of my contract due to the poor service  will never use bt for any service again', 'terrible customer service i was a happy plusnet customer with no real issues  however  i was unfortunately tempted away by a bt sales representative who promised me the world  but in reality my experience has been very differentinitially i had constant problems with the home hub 6 and its wifi every time i rang the technical department i was either given a solution that failed to solve the problem or more often than not i was cut off before completing my conversation  leaving me and my entire family frustrated and often without a wifi service i was sent a replacement hh6 which did not resolve the issue and eventually i was sent a hh5 which did thankfully cure the problem and since then i have had no techical issues since however  the customer service and billing have continued to be well below standard my latest bill included a £65 charge supposedly for asking to leave the broadband service early  something i didnt ask for or was discussed with anyone at bt when i tried to resolve this by phone  i spoke to an advisor who initially tried to tell me the £65 charge wasnt actually a cancellation fee as stated but rather a charge for one of the routers when i explained this wasnt the case as the only router that worked was the hh5  he put me on hold and never returned  leaving me hanging on the phone for 20 minutes  listening to on hold music i then tried to ring back later only to be put in a queue with no answer  and when bt turned their phone lines off at 9pm i was cut off despite waiting 45 minutes for a reply i then attempted to contact bt via the online chat  eventually after a 30 minute wait i spoke to a lady call advisor who initially told me the £65 was credited back to my account in a payment of £7595 to my account in july i explained that this was incorrect and the £75 95 credit was a refund promised to me for leaving my previous provider plusnet early to cover their early cancellation fee bt repaid me the charges made to me by plusnet she then said i would receive a £65 refund to my account  she also insisted i should relax something that i feel wasnt appropriate at the time when i demanded that i wanted to escalate my complaint to a supervisor  she stalled for a while and eventually passed my complaint over to a supervisorhe asked what could be done to resolve my complaint and i explained i wanted early cancellation of my contract with no cancellation fees as i felt the service isnt fit for purpose he told me he couldnt do this and would have to escalate this further and promised me a callback in 48 hours no callback was made to me  despite being promised and yet again i had to contact them via the online chat i spoke to an advisor who told me i would receive a call tomorrow after explaining the promise made by the supervisor  i eventually received another call from another supervisor who explained he failed to callback as he was tied up with another complaint a complaint that appears to have taken 48 hours again  he claimed it wasnt something he couldnt deal with and i again have been promised yet another callback that could happen at anytime over the past week i have no confidence it will happen at all had i have known what poor customer service bt had i would have never have left my previous isp plusnet i have no desire to remain a bt customer  as i feel i have been treated very badly promises have been made that havent been kept  money taken out of my account that shouldnt have been and i have had to constantly endure terrible customer service in an attempt to resolve the problems created by bt', 'unbelievably arrogant i had tv  phone  broadband and mobile service with this bunch of cowboys i had an issue with mobile service  they refused to compromise so i have now cancelled everything  they have achieved a short term gain  but will now lose me as a customer forever', 'wish there was a minus scale terrible company the worst customer service i have ever had even from the managers the managers hanged up on me and the bt staff of many occasions lied

audacity of calling my firm and then hanging up on me in the space of 3 seconds when i trying to assist  words do not describe fully my anger to bt connects employees i will never take a call from

 lying to customers and it has been two months and they couldnt get phone line installed what a joke', 'literally the worst broadband ive ever experienced cuts out at 11pm every night for anywhere

this time every night truly terrible like being back in the early 2000s', 'the worst product service ever  i will never use them again', 'cant wait to finish the contract  bad experience with customer

i had been lying about the previous conversation where i was penalised for being an existing customer bt used to be good but a bit pricey now their broadband is average  their technical support is patchy at best and  based on my last phone call  their customer service is truly awful  bt are a bit better than the very worst broadband suppliers but nowhere near the better suppliers  the technical support which was better than others has become steadily worse as well they still charge a premium and  based on my experience  treat their longterm customers with contempt what has happened to this

english  were very rude and insulting at times  i was asked whether i understood the number 17 i decided to ring sales to try  change our package  the guy on the phone admitted that there is clearly a problem with our broadband  that it is clear that it is at their end he also said that they had to provide what they promised he sent an engineer had to take unpaid leave from work who confirmed that everything at our end was absolutely fine and that it was bt that had the fault nothing was fixed  again it all went off so i rang again  then we were told we would need a phone engineer this time

phone said our problem went way back  that we are loosing connection or speed upto 1000 times a day after 2 more weeks of monitoring it she rang on friday to check the speed  her response was thats brilliant when i said we have 4 mb download when i questioned why she thought it was brilliant she said it was because its working fine anyway she rang to check on it again today  was surprised that i was upset because we are still no further forward she is sending another broadband engineer to test everything all over again  another unpaid leave from workworst customer services i have ever

told them over the phone repeatedly the 2 numbers previously used  they cancelled my first order without even telling me  promised me calls to be returned within 48 hours and at no stage did they ever return the calls forcing me to pay over £20 in paid calls for being penalised by their totally unprofessional and inept call centre staff  i demanded escalations and got flogged off between various

before the new one would be live  if you have no problems then im sure bt are fine  the broadband is good although sometimes a little patchy when a lot of people are using it and the phone line is

not resolving my problem this was very unusual  and told i have no problems and everything was ok  they rang me back at inappropriate times close to midnight walking everyone up  told me they found a

trying to return a dead parrot  and instead  just have my broadband repaired  i have gone around and around and around and around in circles  and my broadband is still rubbish  they are fine when

never once received any apology for the way i was spoken to by multiple members of their staff a few months later after giving up and continuing to pay a silly amount for slow internet  due to being made homeless i was forced to cancel the contract and have since incurred their ridiculous fees of £180 they have threatened me and written me the most disgraceful letters that i have seen from any

account had been closed i finally got them to say that i did actually exist and that they would send the engineers back to fix the phone and install the infinity broadband i had ordered   the date came for the final installation  no engineers arrived  i phoned bt  they said it had been cancelled possibly by some computer fault  they then said that i would then have to go back online to reorder

have to charge over £130 for this despite my protests that it was their engineers that had caused me to be without a phone for more than 2 weeks and with inferior bt broadband for the same time  the only positive thing to say that at this point and with many hours wasted i asked if their cancellation meant that any contractual obligation i had to bt was at an end they said yes i am now back with

on time at the time of order i was told that i was likely to get a speed of about 50mbs  the connection speed i actually get is 70mbs  the connection is completely solid and so far there have been no

problem was the wifi  i am using a bthub 3 and in my opinion the wifi range is abysmal my hub is upstairs and in the room below is my sky box and broadband adaptor  every couple of hours the adapter

found to be anything that isnt bts fault you will be charged £129 i was confident i had checked everything was ok so i allowed an engineer to come the engineer didnt say a deal and left next bill  yes youve guessed  £129 i rang up fuming and was told you switch your router off at night i explained that having seen a few burnt out routers on facebook etc thats why i switched off ok  in fairness they did refund me all went well for 3 months thereafter  until a guy from bt rang me about bt infinity i showed an interest but didnt buy  but believe me  my broadband hasnt worked correctly since it is down now  and has been for the last 3 days the nice guy in the indian call centre assured me an engineer would look at my problem tomorrow however a call 5 mins later from the same nice indian guy was bad news  they wont be looking tomorrow after all so its a case now of just waiti wouldnt recommend bt to my worst enemy i always thought they were a reputable company with a good reputation  but

available an engineer visited and stated work needed to be done outside of the property for which another visit would be required thus far no one has arrived on two occasions and a third visit has been arranged for yes  you guessed it  22nd december with services commencing on the 23rd i have no faith that will happenin the meantime i have spoken to numerous bt staff who plainly have no idea what is happening as very little information seems to be recorded i have received emails stating the customer care team would call on a certain day but no calls it has been explained to me that i didnt receive calls because they had the wrong number  yet sent me a text to tell me they couldnt contact me because of this so  having stated that waiting till the 23rd of december was not acceptable  i now find myself hoping that my services will be connected on that date in my opinion i was lied to in order to retain my account there is little or no communication between departments  trying to

able to promptly rectify whatever issue led to not retaining our original number  and we would have been able to reclaim our original number within the allowed time period the agents ive spoken to

in and an email telling me to return it or i would be charged 4300   i rang and complained telling the man on the phone i had put the old hub in the bin as advised by them and he said  well youll just have to pay 4300 then i didnt advise you  i challenged this telling him he represents bt  i then asked to speak to a manager but was denied this until he had found my account  he was very sarcastic

yesterday to say we had used 10gb in 10 days  get this  when we were not at the property and the hub is turned off thought this would be easily resolved with a call to bt 15 hours on the phone later they will not accept their usage monitor is faulty and want us to upgrade our packagedo not touch bt with a barge pole customer service is hopeless the call centre is in india which makes it even more difficult to get any sense out of them as it appears the poor folks on the help desk are reading a script which they repeat like a mantra whatever you say', 'if i could give zero stars  i would for all the above terrible customer service  calling up was a mustake  nobody knew who to transfer me to and there was no one person in charge was on the phone for a good 15 hours and above all terrible service firstly  they ripped us off and installed normal internet  not broadband as we paid for  only knew this when they came to fix our internet the second time round and then a week later they cancelled our internet for no reason and asked us to pay £200 after another week we found out the it was because somebody else from our building had cancelled it by mistake and not told us after getting internet back for a week  it has stopped working again this is the worst internet provider i have used and will never use bt again', 'so frustrating just opening the pages to write this review

are fake and they also classify usage as up and downloads so in effect a 10gb product is only worth 5gb in reality which means you can only use it for web browsing and emails no videoiplayerbt sport nothing or you will go over the daily usage in a few hours which means big penalties google bt usage scam and the net is rife with people being ripped off in this manner its shocking they are allowed

will call u back within 24hrsguess what  no one calledbut i did receive an email saying ur new installation date is 8th januaryno apology  no explanation nothingi was furious as my children were going back to school before thatthe next say i tried to contact them and guess what i was online for 1hrs and 20 min before i disconnected lineand then i tried againafter long infinity years i gotthroughnow

installed the following daythe next day i sit waiting all morningthe engineer turns up at 130pm  ok ill let him offhe tries to install the broadband only to discover that there is no phone line  he asked if the engineer had been to install the lineurm no i thought that you would be doing it  his reply  he wasnt qualified to work on copper wire i called bt big mistake  indian call centre wasnt my issue  staff that passed me from department to department for almost 2 hours is  i started the call at 2pm and finished at 415totally useless  i tried to log a complaint and after telling them that there is an external problem with their line at the actual box in the street  i was advised that i should go to another bb provider  idiots  it doesnt matter which service provider i go to if the

cancel but they were just arrogant and refused my request out of hand despite the product not being fit for purpose i am now have to have yet another conversation with tech service they are good people but clearly their job is horrendous because of the lacklustre product ignore the advertising claims  they misrepresent the actual performance of bt infinity rest assured  i will take note of others comments in future just stay away from bt', 'the worst customer service ever been a customer for nearly 30 years and when our router stopped working asked for a new router and was told that we would need to pay for a new one unless we sign up for a new contract was not willing to do that as we have been getting the worst download speeds and poor customer service decided to sign up with new

am told that they will look into the problem their normal response is to send out an engineer i have now had 4 engineer visits and there is and never has been a problem with my phone the problem is that i live about 400 yards from my connection box cab and can only expect speeds of up to 26mbps until bt is prepared to invest money in their infrastructure instead of tv and european football

service started on time and then the real problems began the internet connection has a mind of its own slows down to 003mbps every few hours resetting the home hub restores the speed most of the times but not always after waiting on the phone for about 30 mins each time  technical help go through diagnostics then tell you to switch off all equipment and restart which resolves the issue for a few

18 months is over so many better and cheaper deals out there', 'never get a contract with bt you will regret it when i first signed up to bt on an eighteen month contract  i wasnt worried about the

i was trying to suspend only my services  not payment  i was happy to keep paying the monthly feebt tell me they cant suspend internet services  and can only block outgoing calls for a fee of £25  despite the fact that it took them a minute to do so i had to settle with the thought that the new tenant of my old flat could use a bt router to access heavens knows what on a connection in my name  and only me paying £25 was stopping him from doing the same with the phone lineso when i complained to bt on the phone about this  they informed me that they are unable to suspend a service i emailed several times  and eventually received one reply which stated that not only would i have to accept any charges for someone else using my services  but that if someone moved into my old place and set up internet there before i could move my services somewhere else  i would be charged the cancellation fee of £200  even though this is something i have no control over and was not attempting to stop or suspend paying my monthly feeso i complained to the communications ombudsman it took two months for them to get back to me with an answer they were polite enough but frankly have no clout whatsoever they said they couldnt deal with this as it was a commercial decision made by bt as in something bt is doing so what exactly can they deal with nor did they make any reference to my complaint at being charged £25 for bt to block outgoing calls from my number the ombudsman is useless and clearly dont challenge bt at all i shouldnt have been too surprised seeing as how readily bt

speeds of many householders all of the openreach engineers i have interacted with are helpful nice people  likewise the call operators its customer services leave a great deal to be desired when i say customer services  i am not referring to the individuals who are on the end of the phone who are friendly and professional  but the underlying processes  and the design of their customer interface systems which are devious and designed to obfuscate bt is far too aggressive in its wish to sell sell  sell i would happily jump ship to another supplier  if i could sadly i have 9 months left to go

products as it calls them you cannot cancel a service  you enter into another product its very odd  and smacks of contractual requirements from which it is hard to extricate oneself nothing can be cancelled online  you must call the bt call centres  usually busy  and often in india  where you will get conflicting advice from the customer advisors for example i was told that i would be eligible

reasonable to ask for a partial refund  and i was told that would be acceptable  once the problem was fixed i was later told that i would not get any refund for a service which was poorly performing  only when it was nonexistent  and that it would be up to me to demonstrate that the service was poorly performing  there is no doubt that the underlying tone of a business comes over in all that it be i find bt to be way too aggressive  and not remotely bothered about keeping its customers happy we pay a lot of money  and we must ask ourselves  are we getting value for that money i dont feel that i am as soon as i have an alternative  i will be cancelling my contract ith bt and going elsewhere  and customer service will be my first priority a company which treats its customers as a cash cow  to be exploited for maximum financial gain  does not deserve any of my hard earned  hard taxed money dear bt  try becoming customers of virgin media and see what customer services is really all about

so it all started when i ordered my infinity 1 and entertainment plus tv package  now anyone who has read up on bt knows how expensive the services are  but hey you must pay good money for good services  but hey  i did my bit now im just waiting on bt to do theirs at first they gave me the wrong hub so i got standard broadband instead of my infinity which in turn led to me not receiving my premiuim channels  sucks right well when i called up i was hung up on twice and then finally spoke to someone who seemed genuinely interested in sorting out my problem  or maybe its just because we all know calls are recorded for quality purposes hah what a joke that is i am actually in fits of giggles no  i lied  i most definitely am not so anyway even though i didnt receive the correct services for the first month i paid my bill having faith that good old abdul or as you and i know him as adam from bt well you let me down didnt you adam or abdul or whatever and now my second payment has been taken and can you believe the cheek theyve taken almost triple what my bill should be out of my bank i am still greaving over my hard earned cash i mean i dont even have a landline so i cant be going over on my call package  i have unlimited broadband so it cant be that whatever you do  do not get bt services', 'this review is of a new connection and we are new customers to bt bts broadband checker suggests 234mbs where as 3 other independent speed checking sites suggest 182mbs  194mbs and 204 mbs bt have failed 4 times to connect our broadband  each time giving a definite date  assuring us that the connection has been fast tracked on the 5th attempt after the engineers rejected the request for fast track  it was connected but a day later than promised customer support was appalling  both call centres based in uk and india were as bad as each other  bts policy will not let you speak to a manager  who you get taking your call is the person that you will deal with  yet after each person assured us that they would personally check and email and call me to update  none of them have a complaint was raised and the person dealing with the complaint said they would call me back at a specific time  it is now 4 days later and no call apologies if this is a rant but if this is what a company is like to new customers  i dread to think what it will be like once we are no longer regarded as new ', 'worst provider i have ever had  i would advise anyone thinking of joining bt to look elsewhere customer service is non existent  and you can rarely speak to anyone who understands or speaks englishthe broadband speed is lucky to reach 1mb  stay well clear of bt', 'awful product always failing do not switch to bt go with sky', 'do yourself a favour and do not get bt broadband  our internet just cuts out multiple times a day this dispite several engineer visuts and literally days trying to get throught to and speaking with indian customer services   the company should change its name to indian telecoms  bit also took them over 6 months to honour our introductary offer as we signed up onlineas soon as our contract is finished im going back to sky', 'i ordered fibre plus 1st february 2021 i asked for a check to make sure all will be ok  that is a quick survey  and was told by text this will happen installation was due on the 19th march  i received emails and texts to tell me an engineer will attend between 8am and 1pmthe day before i called to make sure but was told there will be no need as cable does not need to be replaced then between 7am and 730 one guy was at my door from kelly communications  he refused to install and leftbt then decided to place an order as if i did for ordinary fibretoday 26th march it is very slow and carry on breakingi am elderly so probably they think i do not need good and reliable broadbandhorrible company all about money  no sense of duty or morality', 'finally leaving bt after over 30 years ive stuck with them and rubbish broadband  spending thousands in the process  in the hope it will improve or fibre would arrive in the past 24 hours ive been cut off and not phoned back  lied to that i cant raise a complaint unless i leave and kept on hold for up to 30 minutes going to 4g and giving up our landline in my opinion they should no longer be allowed to operate', 'hi bt team today i felt that i had to write a review on your wonderful bt team i have been through to 3 departments today bt tv accounts  bt billing  bt tv reception  each person i spoke to was understanding  helpful  patient sunny in doncaster a special thanks to him he is such a nice young man he explained everything in full  not rushed  there was a favourable outcome outstanding customer service unfortunately i have forgotten the names of the 2 ladies who dealt with my next queries but they were equally the samemany thanks from me a 75 lady  keep up the good work irene davies', 'absolutely shocking broadband useless for home workers avoid at all costs and choose any alternative provider', 'it took them 27 days to switch my adress  after they fail 3 times to do itthe internet is down every 10 minutes for couple of seconds impossible ti wotk from home i wanted to cancel the contract  but they put me a tax of £268  because i dont want this poor service', 'had issues from the start with bt i was in a situation where i had to call to set up my account they took down multiple details incorrectly they informed me i would receive a welcome pack and over two weeks later i havent received anything i eventually had to call to get access to my online account with bt this took over an hour due to multiple issues for example  no one was able to provide my landline phone number which i dont use or want  the reason they said was for security purposes i confirmed all my security questions and was still unable to get this detail until almost an hour into the call i had to speak to 3 different people altogether and 2 were very rude while the first person i spoke to was polite so hit and miss on the customer service next comes the broadband speed check i have had broadband for just over 2 weeks i pay for 74mbs fibre every test i did came in between 20mbs and 52mbs download speed i reset my router and tried again multiple times i then  after getting access to my account online ran a bt speed test a few of them  it always came in at 74mbs so what i have now come to the conclusion is a fake test as even a wired connection to the router never got above 52mbs the biggest joke is the actual broadband products they provide they only guarantee a speed at less than half of what you pay for in my opinion  this 74mbs package should therefore be advertised as a 34mbs package with fibre  you would expect a consistent faster speed than a standard package unfortunately  i am stuck with bt for now  previously i was with virgin at 100mbs with no real issues for over 8 years speed tests were much more consistent  sometimes exceeding what i was paying for as soon as virgin becomes available in my area i will be changing suppliers back to virgin overall  bad router  bad broadband package  wrong advertising on their products  hit and miss with customer service  bad website  fake bt speed test broadband hasnt cut out hence the 2 stars on reliablity but it is slowly getting worse before having to reset the router each time', 'bt have consistently failed to deliver acceptable standards of customer service 1 competitive contract prices had to negotiate new contract prices down to new customer levels over the course of 1 hour they then included at their own decision antivirus software at the cost of £8 per month this had to be removed at my request it was not mentioned that it was included as an add on a complaint was raised2 cancelled my contract on the incorrect date when moving home i informed bt i was leaving my current property and when the contract should end they cancelled it on an incorrect date leaving me without home broadband for 25 weeks offering a 4g mini hub as an apology which has been poor several complaints were raised3 attempting to charge for a homehub when leaving bt  bt will provide a package so that you can return the homehub to them or face a fee of £43 this was not received before the move and bt have attempted to charge for this a complaint was raised i would never use bt again i would never recommend bt to friends or family and would in fact actively discourage people from using their services', 'ive been with bt for over 5 years now  and to be honest  ive had absolutely no issues at all im in a new build property  so that probably helps  all the phone line plumbing etc is new so i cant really comment on customer service as ive had zero reason to get in touch with them  other than to upgrade from standard adsl to infinity 2 a few years ago the standard bt hubs are not  in my opinion  particularly great  so i ditched mine ages ago and use a good quality unit purchased separately i have found speed to be consistently good  better than advertised the only issue is price  it has crept up somewhat during my contract  so ive knocked customer service down to 4 stars as i dont like the practice of hiking prices for existing customers  although bt arent the only offenders here overall  good reliable service but not especially competitive on price  so im looking around for alternatives now', 'doesnt even deserve one star doesnt even deserve one star so i signed up for bt on the 6th of january didnt hear anything from bt after so i had to get back in touch and order again on the 25th of january my hub arrived pretty quickly to be fair but this was literally the only quick and efficient part opened the box and half of the connections were missing  there was no adsl filter or grey connection cable so i waited for a couple of days and still herd nothing from bt so i made a call to find out when i would be connected they told me i would go live on the 5th of february  this date came and went so i had to contact bt again  they then said i would be live on the 12th of feb  which was fine the 12th came and still no connection  so of course i called bt again  they told me they needed to get an engineer out and that one would come on the 15th  yes you know whats coming next  still no broadband or engineer i had to make yet another call to bt to then be told that an engineer would be out to get the connection up and running etc on the 4th of march and i would be live between the 4th6th  yet again still no connection so i had to make another phone call yet again today to my frustration i was told the same bull and that they would speak to the connections team so i was told she would one be a few short moments55mins i was on hold for to then be cut off so yes at this point im done  someone was good enough to call me back and apologise for the loss of connection and said they just needed to go through some security questions with me before he could look into it  i stopped him at this point and told him to cancel my order  he said again he was sorry on behalf of bt and will get this sorted rite away  i said cancel my order and have gone with a different provider now  sky promise i will be live on the 16th of march music to my ears  my children mite finally be able to connect to the internet and do their schoolwork log onto google classroom and try and somewhat catch up with the work they have not been able to do thanks to bt  i know i have gone on a little but i am so frustrated and angry with the customer service and the whole service of bt infact  to keep getting told and promised that we would be connected after two months is a bloody joke  and yes i know circumstances are difficult for us all at the moment because of covid so why keep moving the goalpost and postponing connection for me and lie everytime i called appalling  i will never ever go with bt again after this experience  i will avoid at all costs  certainly will not be recommending bt to anyone ever  also when you call customer services expect to be on the phone for atleast two hours  you will spend around 110mins listening to music on hold while they go and make a cup of tea and eat cake  to pop on the phone for about a min to tell you it will be connected at such and such a date then hang up  and guess whatyou dont get connected  very unhappy customer and angry', 'do not go with btfaster means nothing if it never works 16 months ago i made the mistake of paying a premium for bt direct to premises fibreafter disconnecting my previous provider  i was then told by the engineer that they could then not connect me to the bt fibre as there wasnt any on my street  despite being sold that package i was finally connected six weeks later  during which time i had no internet since then  my fibre has been cut  literally  four times by openreach engineers each time they connect another house on my street apparently  my fibre is at the top of the box and every time somebody new on the street gets fibre  mine gets broken when they open the box why this is the case is beyond me or any of the engineers who have been out to fix it the problem is still occurring my fibre went out yet again yesterday  for the third time during lock down  whilst im trying to home school three kids and work from home so i went down to the exchange where i knew i would find an engineer  who told me that through hed broken it  he couldnt fix it so far  both the engineer that broke it and the one that came out to fix it  have failed to fix it the dongle that i have previously been sent does not work in my house as i get no signal having spent three hours on the phone to 12 different people at bt over the last two days  i have been told that they wont activate my copper line temporarily whilst they fix the fibre usually takes at least two weeks i just have to do without internet whilst working from home and home schooling i pay over £50 a month for this privilege i genuinely wish id just stayed on regular broadband im not going to call again i give up you win', 'we had a really bad experience  we swapped to bt as our previous provider was slow and erratic  imagine our surprise when we found that bt was the same worse still  we had asked to keep our phone number and had been

that but we have lost the phone number we have held for over 35 years  no one wants to help us get it back so angry', 'no grounds for complaint at all fibre speeds  are good and consistent

was told that my contract has magically extended i have to pay £140 worth of cancellation fee this is all be cause bt sneakily advertised the landline service to be mismatched with the broadband  so that we customers will be tricked to pay for the broadband for 18 months i am a student who are financially affected by the pandemics i demand my service to be cancelled free of charge', 'very slow', 'moving over from sky fibre broadband to bt full fibre broadband would be easy i thought  as i was promised minimal disruption  instead  bt have left me with no internet connection and no phone line

landlines is it too much to ask just to transfer the broadband to the other line and then close the first line every bt advisor has a different opinion of how to do this their complaints procedure is not fit for purpose and they never call me back usually half an hour wait to talk to them then constantly transferred its time the government looked at their infrastructure monopoly in the

got and nothing was getting actioned however i luckily got a lovely lady called jinder kaur from the leicester office i think who promptly resolved the issue and promised to call back which she did

refunded the difference only after high level complaint  but refused to correct the erroneous contract price after 3 unscheduled calls to me when i was out  bts ceo staffs first reply to my complaint was an email saying theyd closed my complaint  with no explanation i had to arrange a scheduled call to find out what action had been taken they said the closed complaint unexplanatory email was

convenient for them ', 'stay clear  cant wait till out of contractinternet intermittent constantly o access to subscribed channels but still have to pay for a service im not getting2 separate

young child and toddlermade a complaint and got told we will change your package till fibro broadband and that will fix things  but we cant install it for a nearly a month  ', 'sorry  nothing we can do should be bts mottothe worse experience with anything ever it started at the end of september when i placed an order for their full fiber 100 and tv package it was more expensive than the competition but because it was a line take over they told me it should take only 20 days to get it set up as opposed to other companies that told me it would take a month or more 20th of october was the initial activation date and the only thing that goes live is the landline super useful in 2020 and nothing else apparently there was a need for additional work before they could get the broadband installed so i was pushed back to the 29th on the 29th an engineer came and told me he could not install the fiber broadband because there is no fiber run to this building apparently open reach has also messed up their site and had the wrong details about what kind of broadband can be installed at my address this is the beginning of the downward spiral after that bt doesnt know how to deal with the problem they put me on a temporary copper connection straight out of 1995 with less than 1mbps speed on average and tell me it might take up to 26 weeks to fix the problem at least the tv line was activated so good job there i guess luckily  it only take a couple of weeks for open reach to fix their mess but when i thought it was finally over it turns out that the original fiber broadband i have order is no longer available  in fact there is no more fttp plan available  only fttc as confused as i was i said fine get me that one and lets be done with this another small problem  because the initial order has gone through it has glitched the system and no one can cancel the order now in order to place a new one now this is the peak of autism for bt when i call to ask for a solution someone tells me that it might be faster to make a new account in my name the original was in my fathers name and take over the line what he failed to mention is the penalties that will be incurred for doing so i call them and ask them about that and they told me its all very unfortunate and we are very sorry but there is nothing that we can do i was directed to the billing department to dispute it and will update this review with the results so  after all that  more that 2 month of delay you would think that i finally got my services activated wrong 9th of december was the new activation date and that day comes and again nothing i called today 10th of december and they told that they will get back to me  almost every time they told me that nothing happened and i had to call them back at his point i dont know what to say anymore i have been treated like a door mat for bt to wipe their feet on and then i was asked to pay for that privilege to be fair  their customer services was friendly but next to useless so whats the point 010 would absolutely not recommend  even urge you to steer clear if at all possibl', 'poor broadband internet supplier it keeps cutting off and buffering', 'terrible service  fault with broadband and have to wait couple of weeks before they can look at the fault  been told that they dont have to fix the fault within the first 30 days would be quicker for me to change broadband suppliers but bt will charge me £200 plus to leave before contract ends', 'the worst company i have ever had the misfortune to have to deal with from day one the asked us to take a day off work so they could set the new install up for us then the hub came in a box we had to set up ourself not had a day with a good internet speed most below04 of a meg we pay for up to 17 meg and was told we should get around 7 they arranged for an engineer to come out so we booked another day off work  and no engineer turned up  called them and they said its ok its fixed itself over the next hour the internet has cut out 4 times ive been told its my pic tv etc that must be at fault when i was with virgin they set it up for us  then if there was a problem it was fixed really fast  but 6 months down the line i still have no internet have to leave the phone unplugged so the internet works  so the fee for the land line is a bit of a rip off also and the outcome of every complaint is it my equipment is all broke ', 'switched from sky as fed up of being constantly surcharged for not having a sky box quite happy at the start with bt but not totally reliable

coughed up £100 early cancellation charge with all the delay tactics  unfortunately gwyneth who got shirty with me when her every question ie you need to speak to faults so we can improve our service

absolute worst ntl put me off ever trying virgin the absolute vest customer service without a shadow of doubt is o2 which i have at a 2nd address bt attracted me with the sales pitch and the free wifi

technical knowledge almost zero  i was even asked at one point to delete a windows system file a followup call established that they already knew about the windows 10 issue but again the agent was difficult to understand i was asked to reset the router with no regard to interruption to online services that were currently running  and all this on the same line that has worked without problems

making too much money to worry about customer satisfaction   ah well sky will be happy', 'absolute rip off  expensive for terrible internet speeds  they charged me an extra £5 without contacting me

a fault in my area please wait 14 days  i phoned again after 14 days as i was still getting standard speeds of 6mb and they said the fault had been fixed and i have said it wasnt so you they said they then found another fault that will be fixed in 7 days  7 days past my broadband speed was still 6mb instead of fibre so i phoned them again and they said it was fixed so i have now told them i am refusing to pay until it sorted and 3 months later of being haggled for a £500 bill daily by there billing team the fault team contacted me and said they have found the fault unfortunately my landline does not support fibre broadband speeds it took them 5 months to find this out and as i was paying £79 for there biggest fibre a month i will recieve a credit on my account as i was only getting £14 a month standard broadband and they will switch me to this tariff and after 6 months off all this hassle they finally gave me a credit of the 5 months fibre which was £32 how did they work this out

happen the phone is dead and the broadband keeps dropping i called on 0910 and was told there was a problem with the previous supplier not releasing my phone number but that it would be fixed by

could send an engineer but it might cost me £129 pounds if something was wrong with my equipment this worked perfectly 3 days ago with the other provider  so  i dont think so i said no thanks and put the phone down as he was not easy to understand i then went on their chat line  and halfway  through the conversation  got disconnected i tried again and was told that there was already an expert working on it and also an engineer booked to come to my house i never agreed to that any way was there an expert working on it or was it an engineer coming to mei then said i wanted to leave bt  and he asked if he could call me of course he must have tried to call my landline because a few minutes later he asked  on the chat line  if i had another phone numberhe called and transferred me to someone else this person went through the same rubbish all over again  so i said i wanted to leave bt  got transferred to another person who said i would have to pay £500 cancellation fee although since being with them i have had no working phone and appalling broadband but if i leave now  im in breach of contract what about them being in breach of contract by not providing what im paying fori then had to agree to an engineer coming to my house but not till the 14th i told this advisor that i needed my phone as i am an oap and expecting rather important calls from my solicitor my mobile is not brilliant  and i told him so  so  he tried to sell me a £6 a month sim card from bt how would that make my mobile better it also seems to be that only if i am without service for 10 days will i

took only to find out that it would take a further two weeks beyond the original start date to install a two week break in my service and that it was significantly cheaper elsewhere  i then cancelled

cancellation the word cancellation was never in the text  the operative said that an order confirmation is semantically correct for an order cancellation  not in my world it is comical looking back

saying mostly he blamed openreach for the problem  but that is surely a cop out if he was calling to deal with my complaint  surely that means that whatever arm of bt he worked for was taking responsibility for it he also seemed to contradict himself over and again first telling me he could give me a rebate on rental for the number of days outage  then saying he could not unless it was 5 consecutive days outage  which we had not had  i tried to clarify what he was saying  getting very frustrated that he seemed to keep contradicting himself at the end of the conversation i told him i thought it very poor service that we had to be without internet for 5 consecutive days and that i would look for another service provider we agreed though that he could close the complaint as we seemed to be going round in circles and he said he would make the rebate i dont know if we are getting a rebate or not i was left feeling very confused and frustrated  so much for customer service he

answer your not our customer so ok i cancelled my existing contract with my isp and joined bt broadband with a promise of 15mbs but when i connected up over three days of use the only speed i was getting was 001 mbs if i was lucky so there was a fault and my former isp lost a contract because of bt cheat also the speed that i now get is so say 58 mbs and yet if i connect more than one laptop

switched to bt broadband  and i have been totally shocked by how apalling the whole  experience has been mistakes in connecting the service  a router that doesnt work properly and terrible download

home for me  bt epitomises the worst of the uk a postcolonial monopoly that thinks it is competitive because it is a private company with such an appalling service  it would not survive in a truly commercial market like the us a total farce  and one star is one too may in each category i should have trusted my instinct and avoided bt like the plague instead of falling for the marketing hype',

from 8am  1pm contacted them again and they couldnt say why the engineer never turned up then rebooked my apintment same thing happened again and all i could get in response was we had a technical glitch at this point i had been without broadband for 2 weeks and i am a uni student so i do need the internet and was having to run around using other peoples wifi so at this point i wanted to cancel my services but the adviser advised me not to and that they will compensate me etc and that is should try resolving this matter and that they will book another engineers visit and make sure that its is fixed this time the engineer turned up and fixed my broadband  11052017 so i contacted bt in regards to not receiving my bt reward card £175 and they said its not showing on your account so we assume youre not eligible i had a order confirmation stating i should receive a master card of £175 all in all its the worst company ever i have been tied down to a contract which will cost over £400

flat received a text two days before saying an engineer wasnt necessary but low and behold it was and it took 2 weeks to sort out that then we moved flat within our 12 month period so transfer our

say thats all they can see of our internet not working ive sat all night and watched my hub turn into some sort of disco light with all the colours you could imagine as the internet isnt working weve had 4 engineers appointments one failed to turn up and therefore was a waste of my half a days wages to wait in and 3 havent managed to fix the problem tried to get out the contract however they said when they run tests its above the 4mbs speed that is the minimum even though the engineer said we werent getting that and ive numerous screenshots of it when we ever do get a connection the highest

years the service gets worst but the prices go up and there is not much you as a costumer can do and their costumer service will make you lose your mind because they are  unfortunately  very very very bad at they job', 'i am absolutely disgusted with the service weve had from bt  the lack of communication between its staff and the service itself i asked for my account to be cancelled in january as i was moving and they are still charging me now despite me leaving the property and cancelling the line ive just had to pay a £100 bill to close the account i would not recommend bt to anyone for

fine but it is ruined by the the rip off price increase  2  months into my contract they put my bill up from £12 to £1488  quite an increase they said i could leave but they wont be refunding me my

until the last second also  my flatmate who has his name on the contract got charged 75 pounds today  monthly charge  cancellation after being told by bt the money will come off end of this month so

further days to organise and then another 3 to process the order this was due to happen on august 10th i then received a call saying that the order had not been actioned and that we would have to wait

me on another as im now using a different port  which should take 24 hours 2 weeks and manymany phone calls later  they should have me disconnected from my old connection by friday the 10th so now i

contract for superfast broadband is drawing to a close and i cannot wait to change it may be superfast somewhere  but certainly not anywhere near my router  there is a reason that you get free bt hotspot access with your package the broadband in your home only works about a 3rd of the time so youl  spend the other time connected to this hourly service oh  plus it isnt free when you compare the price of bt to other providerssince pretty much after the line had stabilised i have had connectivity issues that have warranted engineer visits  numerous router replacements and constant resetting of the router and checks of the line  regarding the router  i have no problem picking up my neighbours wifi or even bt fon  but can my devices ever find my own router  of course not   trying to get hold of bt to discuss any issue is also an issue in itself  if you can navigate the web page and actually find their contact details they would far rather fob you off into their community than talk to you in person  the fact that there exists a community of disaffected customers in the first place says it all  really price wise  far  far too expensive for what you receive  do yourself a massive favour and look elsewhere  i will not make the mistake of utilising bt again', 'do not sign any contract with bt sorry for the capital letters but i really cant emphasize this enough i signed an 18month contract with bt the broadband speeds were incredibly slow less than 1mbps to the point where i couldnt event open emails bt were unable to fix the problem but flatly refused to free me from my contract i consequently had to get my broadband from another provider hyperoptic while continuing to pay bt every month for their useless internetso two monthly broadband bills the bt staff are extremely unpleasant too since their service is so poor i suspect they are unable to retain customers based on quality  so instead focus on making leaving contracts as difficult and timeconsuming as possible their website is a perfect example of this avoid at all costs', 'everything they do is with the purpose of taking your money off you for a product you arent getting and they know they cant provide guaranteed speeds  with £20 back if they dont meet your minimum  actually means they dont monitor your speed at all and the speed test app they provide to check it yourself  will tell you your speed is as expected  when its less than a 3rd of what youre paying for youll get £20 if they cant fix your speed in 3 months and charge you £50 per month while you wait wow  awesome deal bt i think the misinformation on the speed app is fraud  so ive reported them to ofcom one final warning before you make the same mistake i did they make it as difficult as possible to complain you can only complain by phone and each time you ring  its like its the 1st call youve made im waiting for a manager to call me back ive no confidence at all that they ever will apparently the call back was guaranteed to be within 2 hours ive since called back and been told im in a long queue and they cant give me any idea when ill get the call i feel like theyre stealing from me and im contractually

of which were fulfilled 3 months of chasing them and they eventually came up with a compensation offer far lower than what thier advisors had assured me i would receive for the time with poor internet connection very little care for thier customers  often increasing monthly fees mid contract', 'absolutely useless company  been with bt for years but not anymore  i phoned to report my broadband kept dropping out and was below 1mb  was told i needed the full fibre package and that would sort it out  nothing changed only the size of the bill considerably increased  since then they have come every few weeks to try and sort it including digging a trench through my lawn  all of which made no difference  all the engineers admit i am paying to much for a low service  but when you call the customer service department they seem to think the service is okay  no other provider can give me any better connection but they are a lot cheaper  so much for customer loyalty', 'bt should be avoid at any cost from any one probably because the cov19 make them loose money they drop to less than 1gb my connection for the las tree weeks i phone on bt so the man on the other side of the line say that tomorrow morning we will send a technician and bla bla and then he change his mind and say we will send a technician in 11 days  pedants  arrogants    avoid bt that company make a realy bad name to

rang again 15hrs later spoke to someone who said they will send another engineer out yet again no problem apparently  still no phone line or broadbandrang again their exact words were nothing they could do after complaining they admitted that the line hadnt been switched over  this was done 48hrs later and all seemed wellbut 24hrs later broadband went down and guess what still not working 2months later and the official line from bt is nothing they can dobut they still are charging me for the service i am trying to switch again but this is a struggle as the new company are saying that

is not the case i switched from virgin media due to rising cost never had any issues with the wifi signal with virgin when i switched to bt i gave it a week or so to let equipment settle down however

hub installed however  wifi signal is terrible i use bt app on phone to check service regularly as devices will disconnect and my phone often says switching to mobile data as i have it set on poor

used this company out of pocket  time and patience with bt', 'just a quick summary of the inadequate service i have received from bt throughout the complaint   1    on 21st october i received a letter from bt stating that another customer wants to take over the phone line ref wltutc the letter stated that if i did not call bt by 2nd november at 2pm the service will cease  2    i called bt on 25th october to  to advise that i did not authorize another customer to take over the line and to reject the take over request 3    i was advised by bt that they will reject the takeover and i dont need to take any further action 4    on 2nd november i had a complaint from my tenant that the broadband had stopped working at the property i instantly knew what the issue was and contacted bt to inform them of the situation i explained about the letter which i received stating that the broadband would cease on 2nd november and this is what had happened 5    although i explained exactly what the fault was to the faults team the bt advisor carried out some tests and concluded that my broadband was still showing as live on their bt system and the fault had nothing to do with the takeover request  but was in fact a router issue advisor said she would post out a new router within 35 wokring days 6    although i could not believe this was just a massive coincidence that the broadband stopped working on the date the letter said it would i gave the advisor the benefit of the doubt and she arranged to send a new router out in the post  7    on 5th november i called bt for an update with the router the faults team now changed their mind and informed me that the fault was not down tot he router  but it was now due to a network error which would 100% be fixed by 9th november again  i informed the engineer that the problem was down to the takeover request and again my advise was disregarded 8    the broadband was still now working on the 9th as promised and when i called up i was shocked that the faults team now state its the router and sent yet another router out  9    so far we have had 2 routers and both of them did not work bt were still insisting it was a router fault so we decided to go out and buy our own router costing me £128 again this did not resolve the issue so again bt sent a third router out which did not work by this point i was angry  frustrated and disappointed in bt staff failure to identify a problem even though i kept insisting that the fault was down to the take over i was still being ignored by the faults team 10  bt decided it was best to send an engineer out who was booked in to visit the property on 17th november the tenant and his son both took the day off work to wait in for the engineers visit but the engineer cancelled the appointment on the day this meant that the tenant lost wages taking unpaid leave to sit around for the engineer who did not even turn up this was now causing myself and my tenants unbelievable stress and disappointment  11  we were advised that the engineer did not need to visit as they found the fault and promised the broadband would now be working on 19th november  12  the 19th of november came and again more disappointment as the broadband was still not working it was only when i was put through to the cancellations team in the uk to cancel the service with bt that i actually spoke with a woman who actually listened to me and done some further investigation and discovered that what i had been saying throughout this ordeal was actually correct she discovered that the takeover was rejected by bt but the broadband had somehow slipped through the network and was cancelled  13  finally  someone in bt listened after 2 weeks of messing me and my tenant about at least now we knew what the issue was 14  the broadband was finally back working on 24th november 3 weeks after the fault was reported 15  throughout this time i have spent over 10 hours  in communication with bt i have spend over £80 on phone calls from thailand not once would bt staff call me back as they stated they cannot call outside the uk i have been given 4 different guaranteed dates when the issue should have been fixed we have had to take unpaid leave to wait for the bt engineer who did not turn up  the tenant has had to use excessive mobile date due to no broadband  we have spent £128 on new router  i have had to pay the tennant £400 in compensation  i have been put through hell by incompetent bt staff who refused to listen to me all of this could have been avoided if bt just listened to customers and stopped being robots just doing what they are told to by a computer 16  this has been the absolute worst experience i have ever had with a service provider in my life it has caused me so much stress and anger 17  so i would expect the following to be compensation £80 calls from thailand public phones10 hours of my time talking to incompetent bt staff  £10 per hour  £100£128 for the new router we had to buy as you advised the 3 bt sent out were all faulty£100 for the stress and inconvenience this has caused me when i am supposed to be on holiday£100 towards the compensation i had to pay the tenants for taking unpaid leave to wait in for the engineers plus the excessive data usage when wifi was not working total claim £508', 'living in an area where we have a bt only exchange we have limited choice of supplierwhilst the broadband hasbeen largely reliable and reasonable in speed when there have been problems it has taken hours and hours talking to customer services being kept waiting and passed

charge me for a service i was no longer receiving taking money from my bankif an individual did this it would be deemed theftin both cases it involved hours of calls to resolve  something i will not

given to me and constantly been told there is nothing wrong with my line or broadband  i havent experienced any drop outs the latest instruction from bt was that wifi is not guaranteed  i should be

when today is 16th feb 2017 at 200 pm and still there is no sign of my internet connection although i am talking everyday to their customer representatives best part is that they assure you that you will get it but they dont know when me and my husband work from home and it has been a big blow to us monetarily and has been very very stressful avoid bt please', 'by far one of the worst companies i have ever dealt with do not usei took out a contract with them for my broadband and tv all was good  and then i needed to leave my property  and move back to my parents house i was  of course  not able to take my service with me all of the equipment was paid upfront by me as well i called bt to let them know and to cancel my contract  to which i was told that i needed to pay the rest for the contract this was a further 9 months my argument was that i was receiving no service from them as i was no longer going to be at the property  and i was not able to take with me they said that when i

fantastic when it works  i can easily run multiple devices for long periods of timeunfortunately the broadband does like to drop out for the occasional 510 minute slot  this tends to happen once or

industryi have dealt with them on numerous occasions and you can always expect a minimum hold time of 40 minutes every time i have had an issue it has taken the best part of 3 calls to resolve over a period of days  completely unacceptable in this day and age my last loss of service lasted 15 days  with bt only refunding me for 5 days loss of service  line rental  a pathetic attempt at compensationusually phone calls are dealt with by cutting you off  creating a fictional resolution that can only be implemented after you close the phone call had this numerous times only to find nothing gets fixed my advice would be not to let them put the phone down on you  as they will not return calls and you will have to wait in a queue system to get back in i hope this helps generally

assistants possible', 'this is the first time ive done one of these to complain but bts ability to deliver what theyve confirmed is almost zero their lack of customer care when things have gone very

of our conversationafter about two weeks i began to receive phone calls and text messages from a succession of bt employees  the effect of which was that there were supposedly problems which were going to delay the changeover of my service they were nonspecific about timescales but it was clear that weeks of delay would be involved each person to whom i spoke was very reluctant to explain what the problem was they disclaimed knowledge of the 23062017 order they use terminology which frankly is gibberish  but which is clearly intended to confuse and make customers believe that some really serious problem has arisen when i pressed for an explanation  i was given a variety of excuses  leading to the clear impression that they were simply making it up as they went along bts communications with me continue to be designed to confuse rather than assist  and the timeline on my online account does not reflect the reality of what actually happened i am therefore thoroughly dissatisfied with

service with bt  it kept going off everyday for a month and when i called bt  the customer service guy tells me that this is normal and happens with every customer i replied saying  thats a very promising service you are giving sarcastically and it kept going on and off through out the year however  i had to move houses before my end of contract  i called them to ask the charges for early termination and i was told  it would be cheaper to continue contract until end of it rather than cancelling it now  hearing that  i decided to continue until end of contract  but within a week  an email was sent to me saying  your broadband has been cancelled and you will be charged £ 110  getting a shock  i called bt services and they kept telling me they had sent me an email that someone else would take over your line even though there was no communication eventually  after loads of arguments  it was decided they would refund me everything as they couldnt provide services in my new house

my woes with you and perhaps save you a some money and b a whole load of stress so sept 2015 i upgraded from infinity to infinity 2  the fibre optic network  so they told me speeds of 80 meg up load speeds in excess of 20 meg and down load speeds of 75meg from day one slower than my previous speeds with one or two occasions where it preformed as per contract using the speed test on this page  i began logging the speeds to report back to bt  a few months later  when i was ready  i presented the findings  first off bt refused to accept the data collected using the speed test on this page   so i had  to use the bt wholesale test interesting that it gave me about a 1020% difference in its favour against the one here so trying to get bt to sort it out was just so frustrating  first off billing and delivery will bat you between the both of the groups detailing it is not their problem eventually you will get some overworked person in their call centre in mumbai  who will try and at least give you some proper customer service sadly they will fail if like me you get frustrated enough to flag it to the ombudsman here is where they get you first off  their contract is written in such a way  you  as the customer do not have a leg to stand on you are dealing with a company within a company bt will front the deal  however it will be delivered through openreach and that is where the first frustration starts the contract then goes on to state that if they deliver any servicespeed in their books they are delivering service and under the code of practice that is good enough  as they are still delivering a service  therefore you as the customer cannot complain and should you call them out to check the line  you will be presented with a further £120 call out charge if the engineer does turn up so  if you like a service that states 80 meg and you pay for an 80 meg service  yet are happy to have half of that as a minimum  then sign up to the infinity 2 service  which when one goes out of contract will only get worse do not listen to their customer services  they tell untruths i was supposedly meant to have my bill suspended pending investigation they turned my service off  battered my credit rating  gave no contact details and finally presented me with a final reminder stating all sorts of pain and suffering through the courts once you are cut off from bt they will only give you recoded messages telling you they will only deal with you once you have settled your bill  the loop of frustration no human interaction until your bill is settled the ombudsman services have done the best they can  and against an 18 month bill of over £580 paying for their 80 meg service and receiving less than half the speeds i got £10 for non turn up of engineer and a good will gesture of £50 do yourself a favour and only consider bt as a last ditched attempt to service yes after 23 years  i will be moving all my services away from them  customer service is a word branded about by bt  but frankly i am not sure they know what it means', 'sould be zero stars for speed and reliability have had issues the whole 12 months of our contract getting 15mbps on a good day

wasnt actually required thus wasting a day of holiday the connection itself would randomly die and take a long time to sort itself whenever i called about problems with the connection i was fobbed off with excuses  with nothing ever resolved or any of the callbacks actually done the router itself was awful  and sometimes took over an hour which i timed to restart there were various hidden charges  such as setting up the phone line  removing it  an extortionate fee for the substandard router the price was increased early on in the contract  with the legally required notification email either never being sent or being buried in so much spam from bt that no one had any hope of seeing it the customer support is inconsistent  which different people telling you different things i asked to end the contract early as i moved house  but once this was done was then told that id be charged extra i was also then told after id cancelled it that these charges would not be applied if id just let the

which constantly drops out once the contract was signed there was no end of excuses and mistakes made by bt until i ran out of patience and am now having to take legal proceedings against them they

usable for about one month in total i very regularly experience speed drops  on average a drop of 90% of my connection speed to  1mbps and id saymy average speed is probably lower than i had on their 9mbps connection  ive lost count of the number of times ive called bt and had callbacks scheduled for them to return my calls to on several occasions not receive said call back everytime you call you

should work but they still make you go through their script and refuse to escalate you to someone you can actually talk too instead of playing 21 questionsafter around 20 calls to them i finally got them to arrange an engineers visit to my house for a set datetimeslot and ensured i wasin  they didnt turn up  when i enquired where the engineer was i was told the job had been assigned to an engineer who wasntqualified to do the job so hed rejected it but id not been notified so had been sat in waiting for nothing  another engineerwas scheduled to come the following day  this time he did turn up and i have to say was fantastic he was with me for around 3 hours and we talked in length about it and he told me he knew there was nothing wrong with my connection and that it was a faultat

could and then phoned bt again on my behalf to explain everythingand we both started laughing when he was made to perform the same basic tasks as i was each time i phoned have you rebooted therouter

load until you refresh several times  something i discovered many people across the country were havingon the bt customer forums yet again bt refuse to acknowledge a problem  i now find myself experiencing issues that preventme being able to use the service im paying for and i really cannot be bothered to call them to report them as i have no faithwhatsoever in their technical support and

money from me  this has went on for 4 months at every phone call trying to speak to so called managers with unpronounceable names  getting nowhere was very frustrating  also when asking questions and explaining my frustration to be given a number of long silences with no answers adding to my frustration  i think is an appalling way to treat a customer  when asking for a reference number for which

my contract success  they said they would send an engineer foc well after giving me a two hour window for the engineer 700am to 900am  he still managed to be 20 minutes late he took out his little tv gadget device and plugged it into the input your signal is good he says what is the problem then i ask i dont know he says  i thought you were an engineer says i   it must be the bt box then  can you test it no  sorry he saysas you can imagine this engineer  isnt an engineer at all  he is someone of the street  given a box and shown how to plug it in after several unsuccessful phone calls  i decided to unplug my bt box and watch hd channels on my old sky box although i cannot watch bt sport  it worked out ok  because leicester tigers had a crap year and lost most of their games anyway its an ill wind that blows no good at all ', 'absurdly slow internet speeds which constantly cuts out for hours at a time  do not go with bt  especially if you live in london', 'worst company i have ever

than the old bt router i decided i wanted to switch back to it but two emails sent within the allowable cancellation time went unanswered and unacknowledged left me feeling frustrated and annoyed not sure yet where im going with it naturally one cant extrapolate from my experience to generalise about the service but i hope it will make some thinking of going for infinity learn more about it than i

have been absolutely rubbish i made the order before i moved home  when we got to our new home  they was no landline or broadband i had to reorder and wait 11 days i need internet and landline for my

routers  in the end somebody at bt with an iq bigger than their hat size could work out that its their stupid copper phone line we might get somewhere unfortunately they seem to busy escalating it to another team who wont call you at the agreed time and even worse will still not do anything about the issue  i think we couls all club together and send the ceo of bt a torch and a mirror because thats the only way heshe could find there own backside', 'hopeless  charge the earth after promising the universe i give up we live 5 mile from chelmsford where marconi did magnificent things with

internet service was terrible  we called your people about 50 times throughout this entire 6 months  and it had absolutely no effect on the performance of our internet and throughout time it has only gone worse theyve tried everything from resetting the hub to changing settings of the hub  to last resort of changing the entire hub  only to find out that its not the hub thats at fault its actually your service it is not only wifi  it is the main line itself  as not only every single device in the house that uses wifi even the new tablet i purchased the other day but whatever connection thats coming from the mains it is terrible  because the stability is the worst ive had out of any internet service provider and i will definitely be switching to sky or virgin after our contract runs out  i mean this is absolutely outrageous  the internet itself is not always at top speed  there are rare cases and times when the internet speed works at a speed that cant even be said to be satiable  the number of times the connection drops is probably more than the number of grain of sand there is at the beach  within this last 1 and a half years ive absolutely had it with bt theyve given me no compensation  when asked for help they were of no use and made no difference to the connection speed  only by chance there was one case out of the 50 times ive called them that the internet speed went up by 1mb on the speed test and the guy went all happy  only later during that day the speed dropped by 5mb  and during most of the time the internet speed is the absolute worst  i mean i cant even load a simple youtube video  or in most cases the internet just stops working  i get the screen no connection on my browser  and this is not only my computer  like i said  theres about 4 of us in our family  each of us owns at least two devices and we all drop connection when this happens  now you may say that it may be due to the traffic in our own house  well heres another thing  even when they gave us a new hub the other day  this means that most of the devices werent registered to it  i did a speed check and it was as awful as it was before  and theres no way i can stand this terrible internet like i said  its not even about the speed most of the time  its about how unstable it is  the internet connection just drops and some times it takes a solid 3045 mins before it is back and i have to say this is absolutely not worth a single penny considering im paying 54 pound a month which is outrageous as i can easily get google fibre with that money and that can go to speed of up to 1gbps  i dont know if this is with every area or just my area or everywhere else in the country  but i know one thing  that bt internet is the absolute worst ive ever had and i never plan to go back to it  one of the biggest mistakes of my life ', 'excellent speed and 100% reliability', 'very unpredictable for its price i was on virgin before and it was so much better being able to log into bt

engineer to fix it  did not say they will charge me  i think it is part of bt service  engineer came 2 days later  he came in  put his tool bags on the floor  and then  his phone was ringing  he answered the phone  i knew he is talking about his private thing after few seconds  guess what  he was talking on the phone for more than 30 mins he said may be the cable is worn he did not say why  he said need replace new cable  i said i had a spare cablei have 2 lines before  cancelled one  he just rewire the spare cable to the socket  then did something in the bt greenbox  then it is done  he spent no longer then 15 mins i received a bill it is 445 pound  115 for the engineer call out 330 for his work  110 pound an hour  i also need pay him talking phone  it is ridiculous', 'avoid at all

hadnt activated my line then they couldnt refund me the days weeks i had no internet i could go on for ever about bt bad service but would just advise news customers to not go with them and look

so terrible  its unwatchable i am not new to this i have been watching online tv since it was first developed and i was a part of the test recipients for both the bbc iplayer and 4od  and bt sport is worse then both of these even in their development stages all those years ago there is no point in complaining to bt  they simply dont care', 'we orderd bt infinity at start of march as we were existing customers we were given a dearer price than a new customer  but our problem which bt knew about from the installation   was our slow broadband speed it was incredibly difficult to make myself understood when i complained and the person would promise to phone back at a certain time and date and then never phoned  we had a second engineer in to check the line  although i had succinctly explained the problem was with our distance away from the fibre  and then although the second engineer had told my husband exactly the same as the first engineer i had not contact with the complaints department until i again phoned 10 days later  i have now agreed to continue paying the same price for downloading 9mb and uploading 02mb although the speeds i was quoted were download 18 25mb and

of short intermittent faults and now we have yet another major fault a month or so later their call centres are no help at all and we just get told the fault will be fixed within 48 hours i was

me to check cable an engineer came out who told me yes i had a fault  went to cabinet to patch me into a different port  called me to say hes leaving it because the cabinet is a mess bt dont seem to record any information so next person i speak to asks me if i have checked my cables this went on and on until i said if im getting slow connection ill just pay £25 a month instead of £45 i can only do that if i sign a twelve month contract  ok signed up with sky i know sky will use the same line  but i wont be paying for 70m and getting 40 final joke is they keep contacting me asking why im

issues with my broadband speeds  i live in a rural location 4 miles from the exchange  but it doesnt excuse their attitude i was going to say incompetence but actually theyre very good at promising  not delivering whilst continually overcharging my latest issue concerns my broadband deal which was due to run out in january but as i signed up for bt sport their email said any broadband deal i was currently enjoying would be extended to the dns of my years sport contract guess what  they started charging my an extra £570 a month so every month i had to call calcutta to be assured a refund would be made  the overcharge wouldnt happen again i got a refund of £386 for some reason  the overcharge continues each month  i have to call again i got a call today from someone over here to tell me the broadband deal didnt last till june when my sport contract ends  there was never such an extension to current deals  imagine his shock when i offered to forward the original email as i still had it yet he still rabbited on about maybe i could ring their customer options number where someone could sort me out another deal total bunch of vvankers', 'changed over from sky on 17th april we have been

after 1 week i now have no tv channels i am told that a manager will contact me in the next 5 days to try and resolve after i said i was cancelling and going back to sky think very long and hard

receiving 1mb at peak times so i complained to them that in itself was a horrible experience  i was told im on a congested exchange and they would see if anything can be done  nothing has been done and since wednesday morning this week ive had no broadband at all from them  so i spoke with a bt mod and he said he cant do anything until 9th may when a new update will take place  so i said i want to cancel my account then and he flatly refused to agree to it so im kind of stuck now and find it unbelievable that this can happen within the british law system i understand that every area and exchange will differ in its output  but bt have spread themselves very thin and as a result there is a massive number of congested exchanges  so at peak times 6pm  11pm and all weekends you will be in the slow lane they are not easy to contact and once you do get through to someone you can understand they are bordering on being rude and sarcastic if you try and be herd via their forums then forget it as they have that base covered also they move your post around in their forums to suit themselves and to hide your complaints within a web of old post  they also use india call centres that will send you mad if you ever do have to phone them the worse thing i ever did was to let this cowboy company be my isp all they provided me with was a headache and frustration', 'i have been looking to change from bt to another provider as bt charges are very high  but after reading other reviews on other providers i will stay with bt never lost a connection  speed is very fast and found the

like 1mb and add to this the fact that it is so unreliable  much of the time the connection is so slow that it times out when trying to browse the web  at other time the signal drops completely and we get the no internet connection message  multiple calls to bt on result in being made to go through the exact same scenarios of restarting the router  unplugging cables  etc etc  this in itself is irritating but when you reach the end of it and they say well there is nothing wrong it gets even more irritating  on three occasions we have had people try to connect to us remotely and found that they couldnt and yet still say there isnt an issue  on every occasion we use out bt landline for a call they have to phone back to the mobile because the quality is so bad that they cant hear us  and yet  still say there is no issue  we have asked times for an engineer only to be either flatly refused or told it will cost us £150  to cap it all off  each and every call you make  even if it is within the same hour  you have to start from the beginning with the process of going through their check list  i have suggested to people to read our notes before to see that this is a redundant

problem with the infinity i used their contact form to contact them with my order reference etc and got a reply saying it would take 10 days to reply to me they then sent an actual reply saying i had to call another team as the digital team dont deal with orders why ask me to fill out a contact form then i phoned them and they say that the engineers cant fix the fault at the exchange until friday as they dont have the part they need bt dont have a spare part for their own exchange so the rest of the week without internet and they say that they cannot do it any sooner than good friday i wonder if they actually will sort it out on a bank holiday  im furious with the lack of information on their order tracking system if it says delayed then at least explain why  without having to call and wait on hold if your phone and internet works then do not move to bt they are absolute jokers  and not the funny kind i wish i had just stayed with sky bt are a total waste of time', 'it was all great

conversation i had with one of their advisors  bt refuse to make any offer of compensation well  dear bt  i guarantee you are going to either spend a great deal of time  andor pay me at least £60  as im taking my complaint to your regulator bt have failed to provide the service that i have paid for  and have failed to train their team of advisors sufficiently to deal effectively with issues from

minutes their customer service is appalling with a woman even hanging up on us whilst we were middiscussion  not to mention the people we couldnt understand as theyre all based overseas i would rather pay double the price were currently paying and go with someone else rather than bt but as theyre unwilling to cancel the contract we have with them it looks like were going to suffer till next year my family and extended family have all been told of the issues weve been having and i can assure you that bt have lost customers for life because of it', 'so far so good  i have changed over from the terrible direct save organisation  system is efficient and service is good  having read some of the comments posted by others i am keeping my fingers crossed the good service continues  so far so good

this remote from its customers  and expensive still exists may as well be bangalore telecom  and why is it only when weve had enough and leave are they suddenly interested and the ability to deal with someone feigning empathy and caring comes in to the equation never again too expensive and too lacking in caring and customer service now we have left  somehow they say we have placed an order for 12 months telephone contrct  which we certainly did not the explanation behind this when we contacted them made no sense and id question the legality  never mind the morality behind it never again  even

the bill and when theyd received the bill they suspended my broadband and landline for 2 weeks  caused me so much trouble  id advised any one with children to never join bt because its a completely terrible service', 'so 4th of march came and everything went down  internet and broadband spoken to bt several times and they keep saying it will be fixed in a few days or a week  almost a month later and what have they done nothing  keep getting guesses for a service we pay for this company is absolutely terribly at resolving issues luckily we can cope without a landline as we use our mobiles however what if this is happening to an elderly couple what if they have an emergency all i can say is i am already pursuing other options to look at other providers as bt had said 3 weeks ago that they were fixing the fault until i spoke to someone a few days ago and they disclosed that they 1 have only just found the fault 2 need to get out to see what needs to be repaired and have only just ordered the cable now you may ask  is it just my property the answer is no aparently it is quite alot of people affected including a school so well done bt for the urgency in this matter they seriously need to rethink the customer service and engineering side if it takes almost a month to resolve an issue like this then where are there priorities as i can assure you by the look of how this problem is being treated it is not there customers who are coming first i suggest if you are looking to join bt  then put them down the bottom of your list and look at virgin or another provider who will most likely get things done and not make excuses', 'customer service is abysmal they signed me up for packages that i did not request three separate times in twelve months contacting them is a

called back  got through to a bloke who obviously did not care in the slightest  and was informed my service was delayed because the previous tenant told them they couldnt stop the service yet  why the previous tenant had a say on my service i still do not know asked for broadband to be turned on the same day as the phone line  was told its not possible  i work in networking  its definitely possible and only takes a couple of minutes to do said i would like to cancel my order due to the poor service and received a happy ok  no apology for bad service  no compromise on delivery times to

unexpectedly and she was on a 24hour care system whilst i worked full time so that i knew she could get help if she needed it  yes they will leave people without contact  before they will fix the

with my broadband  i wish i never changed i cant stay connected to my broadband for longer than an hour at a time without it cutting out  the diagnostic tool is just there to waste your time asking you stupid questions and not resolving anything and the customer service is just dire each time ive complained they just send me another hub  blaming the problem on that but it still persists ive never been so frustrated  im stuck in a contract with them but as soon as it ends i will be going straight back to sky please dont get your broadband from bt unless you want to be paying for something

which point we were informed after being on the phone for over 2 hours and being transferred to and from 3 different call centres  from the technical support suggesting that i go out and purchase an old fashioned telephone to test the line from my socket to their exchangethey couldnt make it any faster and it was totally stressful especially with my wife needing internet to study from home in the middle of moving house we also had this idiotic broadband talk which was never properly explained to us and seemed to half work and which i asked to be turned off  with the lack of paper bills it was only recently that i noticed that this was still being charged for despite my requesthowever  speed is good 18meg20 consistently  occasionally connection cuts out requiring a hub restart which is a bit annoying its fine now  after setup  but the whole process reflects poorly on their customer service my wife hates the random cutouts and wants to switch to virgin but their customer support isnt much better', 'i thought my case was bad and made me angry having read most of the comments here  i was kind of the lucky one i am so far  happy enough with the technical side of the services the area that i am not happy about is when contacting the customer services there was no help in anyway  basically they just want to say this is it  take it or leave it as an existing customer for almost 30 years  i thought i was loyal  i have never asked for anything eg discount  i pay my bills on time every quarter all these years but when i decided to upgrade our broadband to infinity 2 not having it install yet i will be paying more than a new valuable customer  no discounted few months offer etc i was on the phone to bt to sort out some internet problems to start  and was decided to have it upgraded after a long chat with the engineer  i complaint about not being told of some of their offers which i could have had this was when i realised afterwards and i was told  as bt personnel  they do not need to tell customer  it is up to us to shop aroundblablabla i have been in touch with two officers  this is what they say in the end if you are not happy  you can cancel your order  nightmare talking to them  but thanks for the comments  i will look at the bill more carefully', 'i signed up for broadband and calls just over a month ago when i was drawn to the attractive offer of half price broadband for 6 months not knowing what my usual usage would be i took the minimum package with 10gb usage per month at £5 per month and then £10 per month after 6 months i went over the usage in my first month and have already exceeded this months usage so it is clear to me that i am on the wrong package and should have taken out the unlimited package  also on offer at half price for 6 months when i have tried to move to the correct package i have been told that i would then pay the full monthly costs of 1699 and not receive any discount the discount that persuaded me to join up in the first place this is because i am not a new customer  even though i have only been a customer for just over a month i feel i have been tempted into a good deal and then had that deal taken away from me straight away i am not locked into a 18 month contract feeling disgruntled that i have been mislead why they couldnt just let me move to the unlimited package with the half price for 6 months offer i dont know its total bs i will not be continuing with there service after my contract has run out', 'i used to have virgin media not my choice but landlords and oh my god was that the worst not only is the speed god aweful but the reliability is a joke switched to bt and ive had fast internet with very little downtime best thing is there is no fairuse policy like you do with virgin so i dont get throttled when i need to download something from steam', 'i was with talk talk for the last few years recently my broadband speeds were down to 05 in the evenings making watching youtube or anything impossible i spent hours on the phone to their help line and had an engineer out who said there was no problem with the line i decided to move to bt although the reviews online made me wary i had good reports from friends who are using bt broadband i took the plunge and ordered bt unlimited broadband with evening and weekend calls i received my hub  2 days before connection date and on the day of connection i was struggling on with my old talk talk connection at a speed of 15 and received a text from bt to say my bt broadband was ready to use i unplugged my old router and plugged in my new bt hub took just a couple of minutes including taking it out of the box the router took a couple of minuted untill the light turned solid blue and typed in the wireless key and password into my ipad and was online less than 5 minutes and it was surfing at a speed of 65 i have only had it for a week but the speed has remained above 5 in the evenings and during the day so far very happy but i will write another review if there are any problems at a later date i still think that getting reviews from friends and neighbours in the local area is far better than online reviews', 'i joined bt on 140214  i have broadband but no land line  over 4 days i am having a hellish time  it is absolute torture  customer service is an incompetent one and have no clue and gives no help whatsoeverdo not join  do not join bt you will regret', 'shocked by bts customer servicetactics when it came to leaving first bt operator said they would send out mac code in post and should arrive 510 days after 2 weeks called again and i was assured mac code was in the post called again after a further week and third operator left me on hold for 18mins only to tell me they would call me back  they never did called again to be told that mac code could in fact be given out over the phone  not impressed bt  expensive  dreadful customer service hopefully ee will be better  they are certainly more price competitive', 'i renewed contract with bt and as the old router was providing neverending disconnection problem  they sent a new router but the new router was even worse than the old one that the internet gets disconnected every five secs i called bt and the tech guys have been doing never ending testing but would never call me back i had to call back every single time  they promised to call back for four times but never happened after never ending arguing with hopeless customer option team as well as tech guys for entire three days  i ended up going barking mad at them  and they finally proposed to send a new router they are just absolutely irresponsible  useless and hopeless in helping or sorting problems out just cant wait till the contract ends and no wonder why people complain so much about bt', 'reviewing this simply due to the fact of how shocking bts broadband is for the last year the broadband in our area has been disconnected every second night without fail during peak times for around 12 hours  on top of this when it is actually running you are lucky to get any decent usable connection  when streaming videos you are consistently directed to 140p  even on this you still run into buffer problems  whilst contacting customer services about the situation bt essentially said there is nothing they can do until fibre is installed  even then i doubt their speed will be all that great would highly recommend not going with bt for broadband', 'wowwhat an awful companyi switched over from sky broadband last may  as the current infrastructure only offered me up to 2mbps  in reality it was only 07mbpsbt had a fibre backbone  so could offer much higher speeds i clocked it at around 79mbpsafter 2 missed appointments  and 2 days off work on my part  i finally had it installed as a goodwill gesture for wasting my time  the guy on the phone offered me my first 3 months free  which i agreed was acceptableafter 3 months i got a huge bill for around £190 so i called their ridiculous phone system  and on the 3rd or 4th try managed to speak to someone they denied all knowledge of this promise of 3 months free  and i urged them to listen back to the phone call as i would like the goodwill gesture that i was offered they said they would listen to the call  and call me back within 7 working days 7 days passed  no phone call i called again through that phone system and asked why i hadnt received a call no knowledge of the request great apologies  blah blah  they will call me back within 48 hours no call getting angry nowafter a few calls on different days  trying to get somewhere  i gave up hope very angry at this pointso i had a moment of madness and decided to email mr ian livingstonhe replied back within about 20mins saying he was very sorry and would pass my details onto a top level customer service manager  sounded promisingsure enough  the next day i had a call from a lovely lady she said she was sorry ive had such a bad start with bt  and that she didnt need to listen to the original call she will refund all the charges so far  including the late payment fees i refused to pay a penny until it was resolvedso  as of 1st october 2013  i was about £4 in creditwonderful resultalas  it has gone downhill from theremy standard month bill is £4445  infinity 2  line rentali dont have a phone connected to the phone line  and bt infinity 2 is unlimited  so i know what my bill will be each and every monthunfortunately the bt computer system doesnt see it this wayi had a letter saying you are using more than you should  so we are increasing your monthly payment to £70 to cover thisi was furiousevery month i call them  speak to managers  other staff  explain the whole story time and time again i have been on the phone for 2hrs more than once and not got anywherethey have taken a total of £350 over the last 5 months 5 x £70  instead of £20725 5 x £4145so i figured they owe me £14275 they refute this another thing is they generate a quarterly bill  which i wasnt told when i entered into a contract i am also on what they call monthly billing as opposed to a standard direct debit  all because i wanted the dd to exit my my account on a specific date this practice is standard in the utilities industry  apparently which is funny because i dont have this problem with my gas and electricity providersby having a monthly plan they tell me that the amount can be adjusted by them each month as they see fit bs all i wanted was a bill each month for my usage whether thats in advance or not  i dont really care  because i know what that bill will be because i cant go over my allowances due to it being unlimited and not having a phone connected i had my final call about a week ago  and after 2 hrs i asked to speak to the cancellation department after another lengthy hold  and explaining the whole story again  the adviser said i couldnt cancel as there was an outstanding debt on the account and i need to speak to billing first i was furiousan outstanding balance when i am owed over £140 i couldnt believe itagain i was put on hold  back to billing on hold waiting for a manager explain the whole story yet again either he hangs up or we get cut off  speechless so  im still at odds as to what to dono matter how many times i speak to them  or who i speak to  i never seem to get anywhereheaven knows how much time and money i have spent calling them from my mobile to add insult to injury  sky released their own fibre service about 2 months into my bt contract on another note  3 weeks ago some nice person decided to crash their car into the green bt node at the end of the street  severing internet and phone connections to my whole street this is not bts fault i know  but it took around 2 weeks to fix  with no email or phone call to apologise i called them to ask why i very rarely saw an openreach engineer at the crash site they said they would look into it internet is back now  so im expecting a refund for the 2 weeks i had no infinity 2 what do you think my chances are', '15 months without a phone line and without broadband  and bt are sending debt collectors to take £600 off me for a service they havent provided this is with the ombudsman now and also registered at ofcomon the 31st october 2012 i contacted bt and informed them that i would be moving house on the 1st november 2012 and asked for my phone line and internet to be moved as well the lady seemed intent on selling me the infinity package and i accepted to upgrade to this it took you over 6 months for bt to arrange to connect the broadband i made over 40 phone calls to bt chasing this and all the while from october 2012  may 2013 they continued to bill me for the phone line in my old residence despite not having connected my phone and not providing me an internet service in my new residence where i was now living i made several formal complaints to bt  the first being  in march 2013 having waited 4 months for a phone line connection but they were all ignored thorughout december 2012  april 2013 they were unable to arrange a visit to connect the lines  they gave dozens of excuses for the delay  including a claim that i was in a remote area i am in central london each time i rang i had to explain everything all over again and then they would say they would call back but they never did i wrote to them but never received a response they then left me a voicemail while i was abroad telling me they were going to attend in may to connect my line i was abroad at the time  so did not pick up their message and was clearly not here in london to let in their engineer they made no effort to agree the time of the attendance with me first at various times bt said they were going to waive the first 2 months or 3 months line rental for the massive inconvenience caused but none of their subsequent bills reflected that  the phone line and infinity connection was supposed to be as a package of £80 where the phone line connection charge is included but instead they charged me for both separately coming to a total of £130 bt continued to charge me for a line rental from 31st october 2012 until 25th may 2013 despite not offering any services whatsoever they charged me for phone calls made on my old line after i moved out of my last property on 5th november £13059 and £2688 by the new tenants that had moved in and they did not disconnect the phone line in my old property despite a written order form saying they would  i made several formal complaints to bt but they did not respond to any of them they never do apparently i then made a complaint to the ombudsman and in response to this bt refused to speak with me at all about my service and disconnected my broadband altogether and charged me a disconnection fee a preliminary investigation by the ombudsman asked for bt to pay me £100  a full refund of the excess charged by bt and a formal apology but their bill does not reflect any of this bt have still not paid a refund this whole saga has cost me a fortune 60 phone calls to bt from my mobile on their premium line in order to chase up the absent services that they had agreed i have been obliged to use my mobile phone for international and other calls and this has added several £100s to my expenses over 15 months bt did not answer any of my letters or emails and did not respond to 2 more formal complaints submitted by post and by email however  they did react to my complaints to the ombudsman by then piling on a late service charge of £750  then £200 and then proceeded without warning to disconnect my broadband  bt then added a further disconnection charge  bt then proceeded to add more and more to the bills despite still not providing a service now i have received a letter from a debt collection agency and from bt to inform me that they have added a further 25% to what bt were billing me previously for late payment i would warn all of you out there to avoid this draining and time wasting nightmare bt is an awful company', 'awful in everyway theyve made 3 appointments and havent bothered to turn up to any didnt ring to apologise want to make a fourth but refuse to guarantee attendance  they refuse to give exact time so im to wait in again from 1  6 pm in my naïveté i thought theyd be sorry about not turning up 3 times but no they actually believe its

all day  no engineer arrived rearranged for 30th of january and guess what  no engineer wasted three days leave and still no broadband customer services will lie to you just to get you off the phone

close to that which is advertised the internet speed is shockingly bad and periodically goes down for whole weekends we have complained many times  however  their customer assistants are useless and

young boys  holding up the refurb work  only for no engineer to appear  we ring bt this evening to understand how no one can appear and how the guidance at midday was that someone was on their way  only to be told that this was booked as a remote service and no one was ever going to come  absolutely shocking service building works heldup and cant even find an apology  let alone a suitable

of the move  i made it very clear to bt that this transition was going to be 3 months so why lie to a loyal customer and not make that loyal customer aware of the line rental charges  a company who supposedly puts customers first one of their core values  i am now starting to realise why bt do not advertise their trustpilot score because of this experience  i will never recommend bt or any of bts products to friends or family and i recommend anyone who is reading this to seek an alternative supplier and products', 'the absolute worst broadband installation is 38 days overdue after a 3 week

should have hd but that it was not assigned and that i would have to pay extra money to get it that is when i decided to cancel luckily enough i still was within the 14 days free cancelation do not

engineer came  the engineer promised high speeds and set us up onto the fastest connection possible  looking back on that  i almost fell out of my chair laughing with how false that was  nothing improved and they charged us anyways without any reason or explanation as to why nothing improved  naturally  we called again and got set up with new internet  this has been a bit better but not much

call the call often drops ironically this has happened multiple times when on the phone to bt ive had them send me multiple external devices which have done nothing had engineers come over with the wrong information to begin with then when explaining the problem their response was that they are not trained in latency so they cant help and proceeded to call the bt call centre and go through

believe how bad your service actually is across the country', 'the worst company eveeeeeer problems for 2 months for instalation  later charging me more than they should and extending my ending

honour i have spent over 15 hours on hold i have been billed monthly for a service i dont receive and have had complaints closed down without any rhyme nor reason the communication network is set up

due to them owning the fttp or something on this new property for those 21 months  weve had terrible wifi connections and speeds even though it was the 150mb deal and the devices would keep disconnecting continuously today i spoke to elle from customer service who has not able to offer anything remotely competitive to competitors including their own new customer offers she also was not honest about prices when asked and gave old prices as supposed to current deals and was not honest about what day i could cancel my contract whilst providing 30 days notice and not incurring any fees overall terrible experience and would not recommend to anyone even 1 star is unfair to the star itself', 'this is the most abysmal customer service i have ever experienced after signing up for broadband our wifi abruptly cut out after 2 weeks we contacted bt customer service and tried to get an explanation they told us that the account had been declared void by a computer error instead of helping us they shunted us between different customer service departments and offered no solutions we were told 3 times that a manager would contact us within 3 hours  but 3 times we were ignored bt then told us that we had to recreate our account and reinstall wifi they refused to move up appointments   meaning that we had to wait 2 weeks for an engineer to come out i am a key worker  who works primarily with children with barriers to learning who have been adversely affected by covid 19  and my partner is studying for her phd both of our day to day lives have been significantly disrupted bts solution for this was to tell us to contact another wifi provider to get a dongle  which they assured us they would rereimburse us for so far we have heard nothing in summation  we are £120 out of pocket with no wifi to date', 'ive had a scheduled and confirmed appointment for the engineer to arrive and install my wifi on the 27th september between 8am1pm like a moron i got up early and eagerly awaited for their visit after 1pm came i called bt up and was informed that my appointment is now on the 30th and that the next one available if i cant make that one will be on the 11th october i was not contacted in any manner to be updated about my appointment not by phone not by email or otherwise when i called the agent on phone she just kept spinning circles in conversation wasting even more of my time basically just repeating in a million different ways theres nothing i can do and no way i can help you so now i have no choice but to be home thursday and lose out on a days worth of money at work or otherwise wait like a jackass for another 23 weeks for the next appointment great and i already had this date booked off specifically for this and lost money by not going to work  not to mention i live in an area where the connection is so bad for both mobile services and internet that i had to step out on my balcony just to have the conversation with the agent that done nothing for me they should make you aware from the beginning that the installation process will take a month or so instead of wasting your time and disappointing you when they dont show up and rescheduled without any notice i work online as well so the it might not seem like 3 days makes a difference but it does im losing money each and every day because of it and as i understand the wifi will take another 10 days to settle in after installation i just pray to god the connection will be better than the service i was given so far the salesman i spoke to was great very helpful when it came to understanding what id get and what i could expect and convincing to boot i wish the customer service would match the sales force effort maybe that would actually give some service', 'possibly  nope definitely the worst company to be with when i have managed to get through to customer service  i have been spoken to like a piece of rubbish the internet is rubbish and when some one calls the house phone the

as low as 10mpbs frequently  this has been raised multiple times with bt who have said they only guarantee the speed to the house what their hubs pump out is not guaranteed so far ive spent hours on the phone to support even longer on hold im on my 5th hub  all the same issue have been sent 3 discs same issue  engineer came out and confirmed their was an issue he couldnt fix it and said i need an sitf engineer to check wifi issues  ive had 2 openreach engineers  who also confirmed there was a problem but couldnt fix it they suggested i get a new hub with the latest firmware  had to call up and order new hub  delivered but same problem  booked mot check and the original engineer came out who said the same thing as before couldnt fix it and i need sitf engineer  ps i live in a detached new build house the walls are paper thin and there is nothing around that would cause any significant wifi interference  im not getting speeds anywhere near what was offered upon purchase and i feel the package was miss sold', 'completely hopeless at everything i gave up with them  having spent 4 hours on the phone in 2 days trying to spend money with them', 'this is the first bad review ive actively given besides the odd verbal comment in 32 years  the customer service and situation i have been left in as a bt customer is disgusting two nights ago around 10pm i received 3 emails all at once stating my wifi would be shut off and account closed  a few minutes later the wifi was off i called the next day to find out what had happened as id never missed a payment and had a package deal through ee  i was informed id not payed a £1113 charge for installation 4 month prior which was confusing  id never had an installation as the landline had been in and working for years howve after looking back i did find the email with the charge so after paying £92 with extra charges i was told i could have the wifi back on only to then be told my account has been closed anyway  i was then asked to return my hub and that if i wanted to continue with my service i might be given a more expensive plan  i was then told if i wanted to cancel i would have to pay cancellation charges for the remainder of my contract which was 18 months after trying to explain i didnt want to cancel my contract you cancelled on me and that i wanted it to keep working as before i was then told to call back tomorrow afternoon sometime around 3pm and speak to the sales team the conversation the next day turned out to be a positive one with the customer service person saying i can start a new contract exactly the same as the old one and have you up and running straight away  wait 10 minutes for a confirmation email then thats everything the email informed me that i was being charged another £40 connection charge  £995 delivery for a new hub which would arrive in 11 days  as someone who works from home my business cannot function without using the internet and while still being charged for an account that ive never missed a payment on and still having the original hub plugged in flashing purple im left feeling utterly defeated and unable to earn a living again this is the first negative

they said theres nothing they can do just book again', 'the broadband was ok  no problem but their customer service is horrendous my husbands name is on the account and  when he left  i took over paying the bill but they could not change the name on the account it just seemed beyond them either i close it and reopen in my name  but there is no guarantee its not gojng to be more expensive  so i left it as it is i phoned twice to renew the existing contract  in order not to be charged more  was reassured it will be 3699 for broadbandlandline package for 18 months that was in feb 2018  and in may i was charged 4599 no one told me about may date when i was renewing the contract  so i left each time they kept asking me if im authorised to speak for the account and the blimming husbands name keeps popping up i paid by dd all 8 years and this is how they treat their loyal customers', 'worst provider ever internet drops out constantly  changed hub twice  speed is supposed to be 40mb but never get anything near that  around 510mb if lucky and now price is increasing for 2nd  time in a 18 month contract know your rights  if they increase price midcontract  you have the right to cancel i am doing that and going to virgin media at least its reliable internet', 'be warned terrible service if you like your broadband company to use sly strategies to get you to pay more then bt are for you they send you an email about renewing your sports then in the small print they renew your broadband only to increase the cost by £20 a month later also they dont appreciate loyalty i called about the £50 cost of my broadband and they said they cannot offer a better deal because the better deals are for new customers only absolutely con stay well clear trust me', 'just horrible my internet is not working for 10 days now ive been phoning them every day they send me 4 engineers all of them were unavailable to fixed that problemnow when call them to cancel my contract they say i have to pay

and childcare costs by needing to work from the office no call from bt  had to chase them  2 emails not responded to and a phonecall managed eventually to speak to the bored sounding executive customer support person  and told they will call me tomorrow when they have more information  update 5th june  day 4 with no business broadband  called back from customer services  the same issue persists  the engineers have not closed their part so the new order cannot be raised but im assured it has now been escalated to the responsible teamonly took 4 days to decide to do this and hopefully it will be closed today  so that the new order can go through on monday and hopefully some time next week i will receive the internet service although they cannot promise that mine and my partners

to review their full processes rather than trying to fix individual issues will provide future customers with a better service update 4th june  can it get any worse seems it can after cancelling my broadband in error  and still on day 3 having made no progress to reorder it remember im supposedly on an enhanced business service  has just become worse when i came in from work to a bill for over £500 they are going to debit from my account in a few days it appears this is payment for my unused contract liability seeing as my account has been cancelled which i did not request so now im expected to pay hundreds for their error and i still have no broadband and currently no hope ps  bt man i spoke to about invoice said hed seen a lot of these changovers going wrong  and account closures that shouldnt happen june 2nd  my company provided my work line and internet through bt  and following a company change asked employees to arrange their own providers and we would be subsequently subsidised lets keep this simple i thought  lets remain with bt  and just ask for everything to be switched to my name wrong choice i was passed from department to department none of which seemed to know how i could switch to my name  passed from business to residential times that by 3 or 4 eventually i ffound someone who seemed to know  convinced me a business account would be better and she would arrange it all  including an upgrade to infinity long story short  upgrade hasnt happened  broadband has been cut off despite a call to them after i received a letter warning it would be cut off  and their subsequent reassurance this wouldnt happen  and now evidentally i need to wait 2 to 5 days to be reconnected i am livid right now  and im unable to work assoon as im back online will be looking at how i can cancel my bt contract due to the poor service the only positive is my phone still works  although they managed to get a bill out to me  including 28 pound to move the account to my name and 4 pound payment charge whatever that is  sounds like they are charging me to bill me really in 2015  can companies still remain this bad  with one department not knowing

firstly only installed the main box according to him there was no record of the extra box furthermore i had none of the extra channels i ordered i let this pass however because he explained to me that it could take 24 hours for the channels to come down i have waited 6 days and i still do not have any extra channels i ordered it isnt simple the fact that i dont have the channels but the way it has been handled is utterly appalling i phoned bt and explained my situation and was told that my order had been cancelled    eventually i was told it was a technical error that had deleted my orders  so me begin me thought well cant you just get them back but no i have been going round and round in circles for days now being passed from person to person  getting hung up on i was told that i would have everything by the 3rd of june it is now the 5th and i still have nothing i am sick and tired of constantly explaining myself to people i just want the channels that i will be paying for

scandalous and their complaints team is not impartial  they cover up and will try to spin doctor everything in any verbal communication and will simply not address anything formally in writing that is harmful to bt the complaint handler will make a conclusion on a situation that occurred which is far from accurate and when you counteract it and expose the ignorance in the conclusion the handler will not respond to it specifically in the next email ignorance is not an excuse bt  sorry  do not act like your complaint handlers do not know what they are doing  it is all carefully contrived   takes approx an hour to get the complaints procedure with the name of the ombudsman they are signed up to when on the phone due to spin doctoring and shocking tactics  internet will cut out when it pleases and comes back when it pleases  been offered the same resolution twice that does not work and when offered it the third time you can only refuse  complaining does no help as mentioned  the complaint handler will ignore anything formally written that requires a response that could jeopardize t position in the complaint  stated explicitly not to be contacted verbally after taking legal advice  this was also stated in writing in my formal complaint to bt through the right channels but yes  you guessed it 23 calls to my mobile and landline  voice messages left on the mobile and landline  even started receiving text messages  almost laughable that they think this type of tacticharassment is acceptable even after stating in black and white that you require bt to respond formally in writing only and not to call but they call to figure you out  what you know and what you do not know to exploit to their advantage  they claim to have the best wifi signal in the uk  from my experience  no way in hell is it even close  as you can see from 90% of the reviews on this website in regards to bt  even the most recent ones avoid like the plague remember  if the broadband company does not provide you with the service contracted for  ask them for the ombudsman they are signed to and follow the correct channels for the formal complaint procedure  know your rights  you can have the contract cancelled without a fee under many circumstances and be entitled to compensation just make sure you log every problem you have because the bt team will deny them even though they

the issues have continued and when i check fault tracking the latest landline fault remains unresolved since the 021216   17 days ago seems they have given up we live in an isolated property and

same thing with sky broadband  albeit  less frequently the things that i really dislike are the fact that when you initially contact them  they tried to upsell me bt infinity  despite the fact that i

computer  through the official bt web page checker  were either wrong  in package limits or that they would send an engineer to the box who never arrived  i never expected the speeds to be consistently at the level i was sold but being told that a 25 mbps discrepancy is within my package limits  the highest one  is absurd plus every drop in the internet was categorised as a one off incident and therefore never needed investigating in the end i gave up complaining as it was a waste of time however when i left the property and got a £31 disconnect fee i was not happy i disputed it

broadband was never as fast as bt so when bt called me over a month ago mentioning that they had bought ee and if i wanted to come back to them i accepted i asked three specific questions 1 will i have to do anything  because i am extremely busy until christmas and if i have to do anything it will have to wait until the new year the response was i will just have to plug the new hub inthe second question was if there will be any interruption with the supply as i run an it business and need online communication with india 247 the response was no  no interruption  not even one hour i then ask what the speed will be answer 70 mgs minimum and up to 80 all sounded excellent so i agreed and give all the necessary details and received straight away email confirming the order and that the switch over will take effect on the 12th of december few eek later a letter came from ee mentioning that they have been asked to stop the service from the 8th of december alarmed that i could potentially have no connection for 4 days i called bt  the only thing they could tell me was that the order will be completed on the 12th i never called ee until then  as bt was supposed to make all the necessary arrangement with ee so i called ee and they confirm that the services will continue until the 12th on he 12th of december i plg my new hub andno connection an engineer turns up without me calling to check if its all ok and find no fault other that the speed is 40mgs instead of 70mgs i then call bt who told me that there is an open exception on the line and they cant provide the service they had already stopped the service i had with ee after mucb discussion i was offered the option to go somewhere and buy a dongle for each of my computer  until the service resume supposedly 48 hours later 3

service they asked us to test the connection with the cable which still did not help then they finally sent an engineer after the engineer visited everything got even worse and we basically do not have any connection anymorehopefully this will solve eventually and i must say their customer service is very good  but it has been taking over a month now and we are all upset i would really think twice before signing bt and in case you have problems  make them to send the engineer over right away  not waste time with some tests that do not help', 'be aware  after placing an order and have to

expected my bill to be what was discussed however this was not the case and my bill was now £10 extra than expected when i contacted bt over this issue  they denied all knowledge of me having any discussion over a better deal even though i have proof of this they told me i could cancel my contract but it would cost me over £300 poundsi cant help but feel mugged and ripped offi should have stayed with sky as they were faultless before', 'okay  8 years with bt no problem really no problem decided to move and spoke to an operator who statedjust plug in at your new address and well call

bt broadband which they gave a a date for the 28th nov 2016 that then got changed to the 29th nov  i still had no internet  so got in touch with bt they booked out a engineer for the 1st dec  great start this was as a new customer  engineer turned up he gone his checks sid it was a fault from the outside whick in my books was good because i wont get charged the £129 he come back and said that the engineer that done it done it from the wrong cab address then he said the good news is  is that ive sorted the phone line which i m not bothered about but he said the bad news is you still havent got inter net until the sort out the fibre in the right cab  so went back on the phone to bt they said they get it sorted the next day which then got changed to the 6th of dec  guess what didnt have internet on that day so i got back in touch again with bt they said they changed the date to the 7th because they wanted to do a big fix in my area as more people was having the same problem and i will without fail have the internet by 8pm no later on that day guess what still no internet  the funny thing is was when i moved to this address the people b4 had talktalk i know this because by chance i pluged my router in and guess what  i had internet it was only 17mb down and less then 1mb up but i had internet  as someone thats wants to start streaming to twitch tv and youtube i need more upload speed bt at the time was a good offer  which so far is the only good thing i have seen in bt the offer would be twice as good if the internet was working if any off you guys are thinking about bt please beware', 'after moving home  i was forced to get bt as they are the only ones supplying broadband to this area they are horrific totally unreliable  internet fails all the time i hope

existing package this costs an extra £8 per month but would solve issues we have with thick walls to sign up  our bt tv package will only last 18 months and bt broadband 24 months this will mean a 6 month gap and pressure to sign up for another contract with bt this is a risk that could be too costly very disappointing', 'i was approached by bt to sign up for another 18 months and that would involve me going on to bt plus at the time my line throughput was 41mbitss this speed remained constant for a couple of months and the it started to drop and eventually went down to 10 mbs i rang bt and unfortunately had to speak to their indian help desk i had to remove all connections from my router and went through all the tests until the last test where i had to hang up no call back on reply i rang them again  a different agent he insisted i go through the testing sequence again again i was told to hang up nothing again at this point i gave up a friend of mine who works for openreach measured my line and said there was a high resistance fault probably on the pole outside i rang bt and fortunately got a british operative who logged it as a fault and three days later an engineer came round and fixed the fault all well and good i hear you say no the throughput speed came up to 25mbs i had somebody ring me to see if i was satisfied i said no they decided to send me a new router i installed this and this one had a software field that actually measured the line speed it said it was running at 30mbs however testing with their own software and ookla line speed tests it has now dropped to 20mbs the router says it is running at 30mbs so what am i to conclude from this it would appear to me that their network manage to system is throttling my line down to 20mbs as a result of this and poor customer service i shall be voting with my feet at the end of the contract', 'we have received help from tyrone both yesterday and today he was very devoted and exceeded our expectations

morning absolutely rubbish service we have gone back to our original supplier  the straw that broke the camels back was no phone and no internet again this morning being pensioners nearly 80 years old

connection 3 times more  engineer sent out  he hooked up terminal to my line box which displayed a different number  so he went out to check  returned to say my private line was unplugged stolen obviously previous engineers working etc  then told theres ample space for new lines etc  then fixed issue and made report back to bt   bt sent the standard email eg  case closed   then line got hijacked again  altogether lost about 2 months internet time  which after months of phone conversations was eventually credited to my account took out a 2nd service  a mobile phone contract approx £372 pa for i phone se 6 year old phone  which was a recommendation from sales dept  sounded ok   biggest mistake i made   phone battery issues galore   to a point where phone battery depleted from 8 hours a day only switched on  and no other usage to a mere 3 hours after a full recharge   bt wouldnt take responsibility  tech support was refused  so got passed to apple instead   problem was the battery  apple sent just a refurbished replacement model  not brand new or a newer model offered moving on 7 months later  they double billed me due to automated billing system error  which messed my finances up for 3 months  bt tried to stick me with an engineer call out fee of £180  based on their customer service suggestion and insisted a broadband check be done at my end to help solve the slow speed issue   fault was found to be bts and not damage to my equipment etc  so another credit made to my account  i should think so forward a few months and i paid my mobile bill by credit slip at my bank  bt sends me a reminder to restrict my service etc  i explained it was paid 20 days earlier  assured my service was restored  but i owed them £55 for other mobile services which they couldnt explain what these extras were  actually illegal as all charges must be billed in detail which this wasnt  i questioned this  requested indepth details and promised to pay once proper itemised bill is forwarded  but none came  yet their still trying to bill me for a non existent extra that i know i never requested as my bill is just for the phone and is one charge only for unlimited calls so nothing else to pay they then sent me a further reminder  threatening account termination  along with debt collection action and that i would be stuck with extra fees for nonpayment etc  a very aggressive letter indeed   if only they checked their bank account to see the bank transfer  hmmmm  so got proof of payment from my bank  agent reconnected my service  but few days later  bt disconnected me again for reasons unknown dont get me started on the nightmare call transfer system they force on their customers  or the rude agents intent on blasting policy instead of active listening skills that should be employed to understand the mere basic of info needed to sort an issue', 'i dont understand why some people have such problems i have been with bt for nearly 2 years and they are amazing i use them for broadband and mobiles  and they are always sss helpfuli am so pleased with their service i have extended my contract for another 18 months', 'i started with bt almost 3 years ago after moving to an address where virgin media was unavailable i had no major problem getting started with bt with everything being as it should be regarding my phone  tv  sport and broadband package the contract was 12 months there were no major problems in that first 12 months  however when coming to renew i had an email from bt before the contract expired offering me a broadband renewal at a reasonable price but with a contract for 18 months not 12 i spoke to them via their helpline but was told 18 months was now their minimum contract period i agreed to this  a few weeks later they contacted me again about my tv and sport contract i thought i had just renewed this but it turns out the verbally agreed renewal was just for the broadband but the tv and sport package were now a minimum of 24 months so  there is the major problem  how can i watch the final 6 months of my tv and sport package if i decide not to renew my broadband sneaky having spoken with my wife we decided to go ahead with the tv and sport as we had already committed to the broadbandfast forward 21 months  suddenly realise that my monthly bill had shot up to £80 from around £40 i contact bt who tell me that i am out of contract with my broadband and therefore have no deal and the price has risen to £52 a lot of money  especially as i can only get a maximum of 25mbps where i live via fttc i point out that bt did not contacted me regarding the end of my broadband deal but obtained no explanation or response from the bt assistant i enquired about reducing my cost of my existing plan by cancelling the bt sport and tv package that to be honest we dont watch much at all in this day and age of netflix  youtube and other streaming tv services  bts tv is not an attractive proposition this is probably why they hike up the price of their broadband post contract to offset the lack of customers taking up their tv options to cut a long story a little shorter  my bt assistant could not offer me any sort of decent broadband deal so i am cancelling everything my early termination charges are way lower than remaining with bt so im off having placed an order with a different supplier for just broadband and phone line  not a bt subsidiary of ee or plusnet i am now receiving text messages from bt asking me to reconsider to be fair to bt  i was never unhappy with the broadband and had few dropouts and would have remained with bt for many more years  however  due to their underhand sneaky price hiking and contracts of unequal length  designed to trap their customers  i will never trust

into the complaint  just had a phone call and been told my bill will increase   i told the advisor you wouldnt fill a car up with fuel and half way through the garage decides to increase the price by 10p a ltr this is legalised robery', 'someone mentioned in the reviews about bt as big trouble  that says all about it and i agree you will not get any notification about price rise  you will only come to know until you check your bank statement  ac balance online when you enquire about it you would be said that an email is been sent to you then you have to pay whatever extra charges as per terms and conditions if you want to get out of those added packagessports you will need to pay extra as wellall this without the consent of the customer i lost all my opportunity to opt out of the added package at the time of price rise with no e mail notification sent to me yes i get all other promo emails not the price rise email spend more than 1 hour over the customer services and the answer is terms and conditions so no point in ringing and wasting time if you cant find any other supplier only then you should even think about big trouble good luck to all', 'do not take this

technical problems they could not give one this went on for a couple of weeks but eventual got my pac code and left b they did however finally offer me a deal which was £100 more expensive than the

speed and transfer through telepathy because all there claims are just up to the router and after that they dont give any guarantees that you will receive the same speed to your devices  first they tried to exempt themselves by saying sir you might be using wifi which i wasnt then they oh our speed guarantee is up to the router  on ther adverts of stay fast guarantees speed consistently but all there advergs are scam and full of lies  on top of that when you ask them that you are 2 mb they ask for 7 months old email evidence that what you guaranteed speed these guys are proper scammers who are only punctual in deducting there direct debit and when it comes to customer support all they donis restart your router and send you cheap cables and max 5 days worth of broken days credit  horrible post sales customer support  every year there is apain last three months twice the services have crashed and they are busy in finding loopholes  its a simple effing transacrion i will pay you

questionable name being lorraine for some strange reason lorraine then went onto explain that it was clearly my fault although the final conclusion was an installation flaw where the tech that came

would be going with them no couldnt do that  later in week called again after talking to plusnet who correctly advised that was wrong etc  was told this time whoever had done order before was wrong and that would sort it and gave me my mac code i trusted them bad move  again when spoke to plusnet they advised still unable to put order through even with mac code another call to bt different person  then later call back from their person as she was telling me my date for ceasing etc had turned from sometime in sept to 29 august  again told by new manager that they had sorted the cease and set everything correct for plusnet to do so next plusnet tried and got half way  ie it let the order start but was not fully confirmed so checked again why plusnet having issues today  they couldnt see from their end  so spoke to bt  first guy said and confirmed that cease was back on after it was supposed to have been stopped and that wouldnt have internet and phone after 29th aug another call to plusnet and this time  who said explained why no confirmation on their order  so they cancelled and said sorry but you would have to talk to bt to get rid of cease and make into migration  which should be not an issue another call to yet another bt person this time somebody who deals with cancellation  who apologised but said in fact that after tonight i would have no internet and phone  not after 29th and that because was so close could not stop cease and could not do migration sorry but that was all he or anyone could do  took a note of the fact that i have paid for my full month of august by direct debit and said to reference this when get final bill to get back any money already paid from 27th till end of august so through all this i get nothing from bt in terms tracking of my call unlike plusnet  where at least you get an email of your query and question  i get told one story after another  i am half expecting that internet is about to die any moment as i a writing this  no real apologises  no really managers who want to know at this late stage of your annoyance  nobody today would let me talk to manager even after they had talked to their manager about issue so stay well away from bt  they havent a clue what is going on  they tell multiple stories and just dont care about their customersbtw  never mentioned all the issues about my billing from the start because it would just take ages i think at this rate the amount of time i have spent trying to sort things out with bt  they should employ me and pay me at least it would then be worthwhile', 'even giving a one is to much  the service i receive for 8month was 06 and this was from the very beginning i had to pay a engineer to inform me it was bt fault from exchange to house even then would not refund for bad service  csr and managers spend our money to learn to be rude so have left and had to pay £55 for a hub that did not work adviced to send this back and i would be refunded  you guessed it never happened  stay away from bt if you have a choice', 'it is very slow and it only works in the room that the box is in and when it came to be installed they said it would work with 3 bats in every room and it only works in one room and also if you have 3 bars its still slow but if you have 2 bars it dosent even work and that is very bad so please could you make an improvement kind regards and i dont mean to be rude if i am coming across rude i am very sorry', 'the service bt provides is awful they arrange appointments and do not turn up although appointment has been confirmed multiple times  including the day before  incompetent assistants with poor training  who put the incorrect order through multiple times they inform you they will follow up on orders queries and get back to customer  but never call back charge you for services you are not using unaware of departments within their own company which you have had contact with previously  when you call to follow up on an order they just inform you the department does not exist  although you have been told by customer service to call the department previously my broadband and telephone line were scheduled to be installed  over 15 months ago and it still has not been due to their mistakes terrible go with virgin  sky  hyperoptic  any company but bt', 'bt are the worst company i have dealt with for customer service many calls are dealt with off shore and the line isnt very good  irony anyone it took over one month to connect my phone line and two months for broadband the advisors are generally hopeless  lie and fail to get

experienced an ongoing intermittent connection with barely usable internet customer service is appalling  the constant hoopjumping means that a solution is never achieved and the compartmentalisation of departments means that the company functions appallingly it is shocking that such a manifest breach of contract is shrugged off by such a big player in the telephony market', 'i can hardly find anything positive to say about this service provider as of now firstly let me mention the engineers  theyre hardly competent at performing their installations job  we recently moved home and wanted the fastest package possible  sure we have that but at the expense of halftrained engineers they proceeded to go forward with the installation without any regard for the previous installed line  absolutely no testing was done whatsoever we called them on this regard several times  once in a friendly manner explaining the issue i was informed that they would be running tests and would get back to us shortly  being a patient person i waited 2 days no call came through  after those 2 days we contacted them again  this time we got through and managed to get information regarding the issue we got informed they would be sending an engineer out by tuesday  sure tuesday came  no engineer came we contacted them  yet again  we were informed that no engineers were active that day surely common sense tells us that they shouldve checked the schedule in the first place evidently not an engineer will be sent out thursday  so they say the entirety of this issue could have been avoided if they tested the line in the first place just to add even more annoyance they send the bill im adamant on refusing to pay this until ive actually had some service worth paying for had i known that the service provider was this poor in my area i wouldve avoided them entirely i will be more inclined on writing a far more friendly and accurate review once ive actually experienced some services sorry to those of you reading this review  i know it is rather long and detailed', 'totally scamming company i paid all my bills on time and they said i owe them £5027 and theyre charging me £12 for

hung up then today i explained my mum has been with you decades and will leave the reply was if you decide to thats up to you  great thanks  so 5 days no phone no internet and no great customer

blocked them no matter what i said because of the amount of refunds to me then they tried overcharging me  charging me for a late payment when it was 3 days early  then they kept disconnecting me about once every 12 weeks even though i was paying monthly  charging me £25 to reconnect me then charging £2 to pay online even though my bank blocked their direct debits because they kept taking unauthorised transactions out the account and they act strongly on theft and fraud apart from the latest advisor ive spoken to must be about 80thwho was appaled at how id been treated  each and every

down on purpose to force us to upgrade after being nagged by phone calls from bt prompting me to upgrade  i turned them down as i do not want to be tied to a 2 year further contract coincidentally

very poor customer service i have decided to take my business elsewhere the package is overpriced  broadband often unreliable and the included email service is sub standard  unusable majority of the

plus side is that i am now only paying half of what it was last yearthe problem is simple but bt will not admit to it  the infrastructure for telephone and broadband in the uk is really old and will cost a fortune to upgrademost homes in the uk had a telephone in the 60s and the same cables and junction boxes are still thereall emerging countrys are on fibre optic as it was the obvious choice but most of this country will still be stuck with copper wiring for a long timei am not defending the horrendous customer service of bt that makes every caller feel like a retard but when a previous government thought it was good to have competition they forgot that bt was still expected to maintain and upgrade the exchanges and lines', 'appalling customer service  inconsistencies and weak

patience with their unreliable broadband and poor customer service i wouldnt normally be leaving such a poor review but the last straw was when they cut my broadband off a day earlier than agreed  and after trying for over an hour to get the issue sorted with their customer service team i gave up throughout my broadband contract i noticed a definite drop in speeds at peak times  to the extent that basic online music and videos would be continuously interrupted despite me subscribing to their fastest  unlimited package numerous contacts with their customer service was unable to fix this so i gave upwhen the time came to renew i was unable to avail of the online offers available so my package would cost nearly twice as much as a new customer what a way to reward loyaltyi will not be returning to bt as a customer in the future and would advise others to stay well clear', 'absolutely terrible service we set up a cloud phone with bt we then discovered bt internet was not available

that could run with fibre optic they would not allow us to have our phone number back which we have been using for 6 years again we spent hours on the phone along with our new supplier trying to get the number i even had one of the team members laugh done the phone at me they have been holding our number ransom ever since this service has been disgraceful avoid bt like the plague cannot stress this enough', 'broadband and mobile phone reliable  poor customer contact', 'bt have been absolutely awful for the past year  both in terms of wifi connection and actual customer service we are a group of 4 students and more often than not we cannot have more than 2 of us using the wifi their customer service is absolutely appalling and it is very clear they do not care about their customers one bit they were meant to return after they tried to install the broadband and realised they couldnt not install it properly as they could not access the required room but then never returned since then we have reported issues on numerous occasions  and on one of these occasions they said they would send an engineer out the next day  which never happened when asked about it it turned out they hadnt communicated between themselves and the required engineer in the past 24 hours we were promised a phone call back at 5pm which never happened  to which our account holder rang them and once again they didnt have a note of this the man she spoke to said he would call her back in 5minutes which once again  never happened it is absolutely ridiculous how little they care about their customers and how time and time again they attempt to charge us extra just for them to actually do their job correct they frequently try to play the number of devices card against us but considering the wifi is awful even when there are only 2 of us in the house or if one individual using the internet at like 2am this is definitely not the case we struggle to access our university website and use

times which is 10x worse considering im an avid gamer even fixing the connection is more trouble than its worth with it taking about half an hour to get it back up and working properly again the

move  it turns out that they will charge you 130 pounds of connection feeand after they tricked you into 18 months contract  you have a choice of either paying a connection fee of 130 pounds or 6
