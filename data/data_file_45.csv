Worse company I've ever dealt with After 15 years of being with Sky I moved to BT and I have regretted it ever since. Not necessarily the products but they are con artists!!!I have been stung twice (stupid me) once was I was being charged wrongly for broadband so I called and then said 'yes I can see you have I can change it now'..... Didn't realise that meant tying myself in for 12 months for nothing.  And then same happened with BT sports I called and said on the phone there was a problem they said they can sort it- I replied with 'this isn't going to tie me into anything is it  I've been stung before'...... Got a no and then found out today it did!!! BT found my call proving this was said by me BUT after the person recited there speel at the end of the call and I said yes to it  I was saying yes to tying myself in...... Couldn't make this stuff up.  What is disgraceful is I have no option to take this further without huge headache and it's not good enough from such a large company. They should be ashamed of themselves!!!~~~,Devon~~~,2016-09-14~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
Worse company I have ever dealt with in my life. Called them over two weeks ago to report a broken modem. I suggested it was the power cable not working  and i was told to go to my local market and buy a new one.  After insisting they replace it  they informed me they can’t and would need to send me a new router and modem. This would be with me in the next 3 to 5 working days. Nothing arrived. Called them back  which took an eternity to get to speak to a human. They then informed me that the operator was not authorised to send me out the new equipment and he would call me back to explain within the hour. No call back so next day rang them again 50 min trying to get to speak to them. They then said the operator had tried to call me back on three occasions but my line was engaged. (I don’t use the land line for making calls) I was then told they would send me out the new equipment  and I was given an order number. No new equipment arrives speak to them again and they say they have no routers in stock. But will call me once they have them available. Still waiting for the call back  so far 2 weeks without internet.Don’t know who to speak to next as I can’t get past the call handler in India. Full of apologies and  refuses to pass you on to a manager  but instead say they will email the manager and you will get a call back. Guess what… you don’t.~~~,Berkshire~~~,2016-09-14~~~,1,1,1,1
"Recently moved from ancient router to shiny new bt infinity as soon as it was available in our area.  Supposedly creaky old broadband was 100% reliable.  Supposedly much better shiny new infinity regularly goes offline in the evenings and sometimes during the day too.  They forgot to mention that by ""upgrading"" we'd be degrading the reliability of our service.~~~",Brockenhurst~~~,2016-09-12~~~,3,3,4,2
Speed routinely poor  customer service disappointing.~~~,Johnson~~~,2016-09-12~~~,1,1,1,2
If you get a UK based call centre when you call BT then you will be helped quickly and professionally. If you get an Indian based call centre which 9 times out of 10 you will then just hand up because they are USELESS!! i have never had such poor customer service then when i call up BT and get an Indian telling me to do the same stupid speed tests over and over again when all i need to an engineer to come out. Absolute trash customer service (unless you get a UK call centre)~~~,East Sussex~~~,2016-09-11~~~,2,1,4,4
BT are very disorganised  falsely reassuring and appear to be completely incapable of sorting out our very slow (phone line based) broadband.  We also have BT line rental so they are responsible for it all and still cannot make anything better.~~~,West Fife~~~,2016-09-11~~~,2,1,1,2
My daughter and I were both with BT for three years. Very expensive and customer service useless. When my daughter changed to Virgin they charged her $31 for disconnection. As a result I left BT as well  never to return.~~~,Bolton~~~,2016-09-10~~~,1,1,3,3
Absolutely disgusted with BT customer service. They have effectively washed their hands of providing a good customer service by sending it to India. I've been a loyal customer for 30 years and never experienced anything like it.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2016-09-10~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are the worst Broadband suppliers I have ever had to deal with. For the past 6 months my internet connection has been cutting in and out. Any time I have tried  to contact them they outsource the call to an Indian technical support office who have no idea what the problem is or we end up on hold for up to 3 hours before the call mysteriously drops off. Eventually we managed to get an engineer out to look at it   who told us that we had a line fault due to trees being in the way of the line. But the trees cant be removed until the line is first taken away so that the line isn't damaged  not only this but we had to get a new hub which after only 2 weeks of use has stopped working. BT still has not removed the line so that we can remove the trees safely. GO WITH ANY OTHER COMPANY!~~~,Glasgow~~~,2016-09-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Very poor  wifi constantly going on and off and at night it doesn't work at all. Went from sky to BT and really considering going back to sky.~~~,Banbridge~~~,2016-09-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have been a BT customer for a number of years. Prior to this I was with AOL. I packed them up as I got fed up with endless calls from India (or wherever) trying to talk me into unwanted upgrades.I am a fairly low user of both phone and broadband  but on the whole I have to say I have experienced few problems. I guess I am probably paying too much for the amount I use but  as the saying goes  'If it ain't broke-don't fix it'.After the first year  like most companies  they just throw you a few breadcrumbs to keep you with them. If you pay line rental 12 months in advance you save a few pounds  but at the same time  it locks you into them for the said period. They also throw in the number display and associated items worth £1.75 per month- big deal!A friend of mine was with Talk Talk (I seem to remember). He had a fault that was found to be in a waterlogged telephone service box out in the street. This apparently comes under the jurisdiction of BT. He had an unannounced call from a BT engineer whilst he was out and (If I remember correctly) had around £80 added to his Talk Talk bill. They told him it was up to him to contact BT. He just could not be bothered- which made me a little cross at the time  but it's his money.Hence I've decided to stay put- at least I know I just have BT to deal with. I can't substantiate this but I would assume that in cases like my friends situation BT probably prioritize their own customers.Why it is called BT when the majority of their call centers seem to be abroad- goodness knows.~~~,CLACTON-ON-SEA~~~,2016-09-10~~~,3,3,4,4
Customer service for technical support is a big FAT joke very rude  very racist! And unable to help dont waste your time no one will help. As long as the money is good for the company. What call center put you through to not help but become racist with names likes.~~~,London~~~,2016-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Very poor throughout  and it gets worse when your contract ends. It is painful  and you will waste hours  probably 1.5 days being passed from one idiot to another  and they will keep trying to close your complaint. Avoid at all costs~~~,Solihull~~~,2016-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
All i have to say is look at everyone's review. They have all pretty much stated that its terrible. They are trying for me to stay with BT and do not allow me to cancel for service i am paying for and not receiving anything in return. I have wasted approximately over 12hours i kid you not in this 5 days alone! DO NOT BOTHER WITH BT AT ALL~~~,London~~~,2016-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Having had to spend 2 hours on the phone to this company I would not recommend them to anyone. Tried 3 times during the day to speak to someone but never made it through to a person . Then when we did make it through at 6 at night we just got palmed from department to department and 1 hour 35 of our phone call was spent on hold. After every month being over charged on our account we wanted answers as to why  after being told we had free weekend calls the lady we spoke to here basically called us liers and said this had never been part of our package. Her tone was disgusting and she was obviously out looking for an argument   one of the main reasons for leaving this company was her terrible manner . BT is the perfect company to be with providing you like to be overcharged on your account   pay an excessive line rental  pay in excess for using your house phone (19p to just connect a call) & want to be spoken to like crap basically   otherwise avoid like the Plague and go for a cheaper company that offers the same. Really disappointment with our treatment from this company shall be cancelling with them tomorrow.~~~,Cornwall~~~,2016-09-08~~~,1,1,3,3
Over 8 years with BT and eventually fed up with their over-priced poor quality broadband packages and the worst customer services so ever. The numerous issues with them from unshown-up engineering appointment  disconnecting broadband service  in the old address without connecting in the new address for two weeks  customer services inaccessible most of time  up to an hour waiting each time for a phone call  made hundreds of calls to them in last two months but only got a few times to speak to someone  never called back as promised just waste time to wait  they are not interest in solving problems but in how to get rid of their responsibilities. What they've done made me feel that the staff don't care about neither their customers nor the reputation of their company. They just don't care! i was told that I have to pay £150 if I leave them after my broadband contract is finish because my landline and the hub will still be in contract  which is an absolutely joke because they came in the same package when we moved house last year. They don't let you leave even they don't treat you fair. The company is hopeless and don't understand that how they can still survive in the business. Made numerous complaint via online contact email and phone calls and eventually someone from the customer complanit review team contacted me regarding the complaints today! It is a nightmare which everyone should avoid to deal with them. I'm leaving!~~~,London~~~,2016-09-08~~~,1,1,2,2
Switched to BT from Virgin as they were offering a good TV / phone / Broadband package. HUGE mistake. Signal incredibly weak and slow so paid to upgrade to a higher speed (£6 extra per month).  They say we can't be upgraded for two weeks. Spend two weeks with crappy internet.  The day of the switch  the internet goes down altogether. We call and are told this happens for a day as it switches around (thanks for the warning).  Day 2 - still no internet. Numerous calls to an Asian callcentre  no one can figure out what's wrong  no one will let me speak to a manager and the next time an engineer can come out is MONDAY (that will have been 6 days without internet).  Something tells me they either need to employ more engineers or run a broadband service that doesn't break down all the time. Having to wait until tomorrow to lodge an official complaint. Absolutely appalled I can honestly say I've never had such bad customer service in my life.~~~,London~~~,2016-09-07~~~,1,1,2,1
Call back service never calls back. You get transferred or they hang up. Accounts are tied to copper landline nobody uses. No technical support is provided. Anything goes wrong and it takes weeks to resolve~~~,London~~~,2016-09-07~~~,1,1,3,3
DO NOT USE BT! When we signed up the contract it was stated as 29 pounds per month  sadly we didn't keep an eye on our account and just found out the past 15 months they have been charging us for 43 per month saying they upgraded our plan! No way to get these money back and this company will try everything to empty you pocket! Well  if you are already in this scam  keep an eye on your bills at all times! If not then leave while you can!~~~,York~~~,2016-09-07~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT customer service is a big joke! The internet keep disconnecting in the past few months and it stopped working since 4 days ago. I spent 2 hours waiting on the phone and finally got someone to talk about the problem then we've made an engineer appointment on today but at the end no one showed up!! Then I contacted them again and they said I haven't made any appointment! They will call me back to arrange something tomorrow!!!!! That's crazy!~~~,Cardiff~~~,2016-09-06~~~,2,1,3,1
Hate it. Constantly disconnects  browsing is a nightmare  pictures are blank and videos don't play on Facebook and You Tube. An engineer phoned  was there for ages  nothing resolved. Sometimes no internet at all. Can't get into My BT and the app doesn't work. Fed up. Wish I had stayed with previous provider.~~~,Castlederg~~~,2016-09-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Unhelpful customer services  the company seeks ways to incur charges on every occasion. Example: agreed payment date for 29th of the month and on that date they disconnect services and add 12£ charge. When called up the customer services speak like politicians  no logic in it and talk to talk and waste your time.~~~,London~~~,2016-09-05~~~,1,1,3,3
One hour call back service is a joke.  Used this service twice with no result - no one called.  Then hung on for 55 minutes before getting through to customer services.  Issue not resolved.~~~,London~~~,2016-09-04~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Impossible to watch catchup TV most days. Ethernet connection.Often disconnects from internet.Really disappointing service~~~,woodmancote cheltenham~~~,2016-09-04~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~

"Bt are an absolute joke!!!! I have been trying to get my bt infinity fixed for the last 3 weeks  you phone them and you're on hold for an hour +   even after that they transfer you to off shore fault team who have not have a clue  or just hang up! I've had 3 engineers booked. The first was sent to the wrong Address  which I've never heard of  second engineer didn't even turn up  third was booked   ( was told he was definitely arriving between 8-1) guess what???? He was sent to the wrong Address again the same Address as the first engineer!!!  All I get is "" we don't understand why this is happening"". So phone bt for like the 50th time. I've now been waiting for two hours on hold for someone to answer the phone!!  I will be cancelling Bt and demand compensation for time off work I've had to take for the 3 engineer appointments!! I'll never use Bt again and would advise anyone else not to go with them! The company is beyond a joke.~~~",Suffolk~~~,2016-09-02~~~,1,1,1,1

The absolute worst Internet provider in the world!!!! Do not get BT  always faults on the line  no customer satisfaction  do not provide the service the say they do  will increase prices without any warning  original bt router worked fine with WiFi until NEW router came out the all of a sudden WiFi signal was really poor ?? So you are forced in to buying new router  BT is the biggest con going  I will be taken them to court  please look at other review sites about BT 0.3 out of 10 !! Says it all~~~,Coventry ~~~,2016-09-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Customer service is non-existant would avoid at all costs. Reported a fault with broadband barely working 7 weeks ago and despite numerous complaints we have not heard from anyone except the odd phone call from India. Could barely understand what they were saying and still not fixed. Have tried to cancel contract and no response from that department either. Entire company a joke. Will be leaving and never using again.~~~,Essex~~~,2016-09-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Works well in the daytime - sometimes!! but after 6.00 pm forget it  can't access most websites  e mails  or anything else. Told by BT customer service that with Infinity  that is due on stream next month  all our access problems will be resolved. Signed up  (probably the wrong decision) but we will see. At the moment makes me feel ashamed to have the British prefix attached to this pathetic service. Had better broadband speeds on a boat in the middle of Frace than we have here in the UK.~~~,South Coast~~~,2016-08-31~~~,1,~~~,1,1
The signal has now failed completely twice in two months. BT took two weeks to rectify the first fault and two days to fix the second. The speed keeps dropping from 15Mb/s to 0.25. It is utterly unreliable.~~~,Kington~~~,2016-08-31~~~,2,4,2,1
I am thoroughly fed up with BT's 'superslow broadband' I have been with them for 10 years but now I am looking elsewhere  Customer service ? WHAT customer service.? It took me 2 years to convince them I was paying twice  ! (I think this happened when I changed to their superslow service but they kept collecting for the old contract as well  I had 2 different customer accounts but the call centre just kept bluffing and blinding me with 'science' until one day they actually agreed and repaid (some) of the overpayments  If you want a homehub that disconnects 10 or more times a day  then BT is for you  otherwise avoid this appalling company~~~,Cheshire~~~,2016-08-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Worse customer service than the tax office! Impossible to contact and frequently cut off. Every time you try again  endless waits  then go through the whole situation again only to be cut off again. Website avoids giving helpful contact advice to the point of annoyance.~~~,West midlands~~~,2016-08-30~~~,1,1,2,1
If you are contemplating taking any BT service please don't as you will regret it.I have been having numerous issues with my wifi and all bt have been doing is fobing me off. I have spent upto 6 hours with clueless customer advisers telling me at the end of the call is call back next week. now if that isn't disrespect than i dont know what is.~~~,london~~~,2016-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Steer clear of this bunch of thieving cowboys. Their customer service is worse than their very poor broadband.  I will use carrier pigeon before going back to this company~~~,Ipswich Suffolk~~~,2016-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Stinking customer service caused me to leave BT  then they let out an even worse stink! They had mugged me into restarting my broadband contract via my 'Free' BT sport renewal! Just robbers plain and simple  I am glad to be gone~~~,Northampton~~~,2016-08-28~~~,1,1,4,3
Our broad band service reliability is very poor as an example we have lost our broad band service 4 times today and this situation is not improving Surely in this day and age broad band services providers must be able to provide a good and reliable broad band service at reasonable charges Cartel marketplace springs to mind in our current customer broad band provision at this time  Opportunity for a good broad band service provider at reasonable cost would take a very high market share of broad band provision~~~,Lazonby~~~,2016-08-28~~~,1,2,2,1
Absolutely appalling 'super fast' fibre broadband and the worst customer service experience. Have had ongoing broadband dropping issues for 18 months since installing  dropping 8-10 times a day. If report fault online  it shows resolved in a couple of days but still dropping. To place fault via call centre have been on hold a minimum of 35 mins before speaking to a human being. Have now reported the fault 4 times  seen 4 engineers who promise ''it will be fixed today' then we never see or hear from them again. The most atrocious service ever. 4th engineer this morning confidently saying he'll fix it today. Came home at 4.30pm have no broadband service at all (bank holiday weekend)  and have now been on hold for 50 mins asked not spoken Tia person yet.  The online BT fault reporting website says we don't have a fault! Disgusted beyond belief that we're paying for this rubbish. The only plus side having experienced this   is that I procure telephony services for central gov depts  and no matter how good the sales people are  they won't be getting any new or repeat business as have seen first hand just how shocking their service has become.~~~,Burgess Hill~~~,2016-08-27~~~,1,1,1,1
the engineers have been here so often now we are on first name terms and have made up a bed in the spare room. They blame anything and everything  fix the problem  assure us all is OK  then 7 days after they leave  no  broadband  t.v. service drops out  slow download speeds  same old  same old. The service is nothing like advertised and trying to get them to get an engineer out is like trying to find Lord Lucan!! Why do they promise what they know they can`t deliver?? Years ago we thought of car salesmen as the archetypical conman  it`s now BT sales and after sales service teams....problem is it seems  all other suppliers are just as bad!!~~~,kings lynn~~~,2016-08-27~~~,2,2,2,2
