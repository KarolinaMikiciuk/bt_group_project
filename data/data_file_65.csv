I rang BT to cancel my 80 year old mothers broadband service as she no longer used it - suprise suprise a week later they cancelled all her services!!!! So she had no phone line  I don't live locally & had no way of contacting her. I spent an hour & half on the phone to BT trying to get this resolved. Despite this being their error they were unable to reinstate my mothers account  insisted the only way to get a phone line was to order a new one which could take 48 hours  with a new telephone number. They then wanted to charge £50 for the line installation  have subjected her to a new 12 month contract. I have never experienced such downright shoddy  & exceptionally unhelpful customer service. They make an error but they penalise their customers for that error - what a joke!!!! They have no concept of what customer service entails.~~~,Scott~~~,2015-06-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The smoothest setup I've ever had  4x faster than my old broadband and 1/2 the cost (no exaggeration).  I've gotten the exact speeds advertised  if not more.~~~,London~~~,2015-06-03~~~,5,5,5,5
If these stars went to minus numbers it would be infinity  their customer service is rubbish and service is worse. We have been waiting for broadband for 3 weeks and still not been told what is happening. 7 hours on the phone  5 engineer visits  5 call backs which have never happened. We have been with them for about 3 years  change - do not go with them.~~~,Durham~~~,2015-06-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Grim grim  grim customer service  speed way below what was promised  and a seemingly incurable fault that prevents me from registering my username. 1998 Dial up was better~~~,Preesall Hill~~~,2015-06-01~~~,1,1,1,2
Dreadfull . . . switched over from aol after 17 years so I could take advantage of the free BT sport. system Input error cross referenced my account with another 12 miles away  hour after hour wasted trying to sort it with a useless foreign call centre.Can't log in to BT  verify my id  use wi fi or tv ten days after the event of wasting over £55 in set up fees  told by a muppet this morning I have to wait up to 10 working days for my complaint to be handled.Did a speed check  upload -30% below lowest parameter promised and down load -25%BT should not be allowed to tout for trade offering a system with such shoddy customer service when something is amiss. To say I'm DISSAPOINTED with them is a massive understatement.~~~,Poulton le fylde~~~,2015-06-01~~~,1,1,1,2
We have BT Infinity. The time it takes to load is very disappointing. The adverts on the BT homepage cause problems as they take ages to load but we cannot choose not to have them. Also BT charges top whack to its faithful customers while giving new customers special rates.~~~,Rugby~~~,2015-05-30~~~,2,2,3,2
Switched over to BT broadband from Sky.They couldn't manage to get the service working for 3 weeks! They eventually did and 1 month later it broke down again  have been waiting one month to resolve this with hours spent in the phone 3 engineer visits  who seem to come and leave without ringing the bell or calling before filling out their notes saying unable to gain access. So many promised call backs that don't materialise. It's total incompetence. Never been provided with such a shocking service in my life~~~,Wandsworth ~~~,2015-05-30~~~,~~~,3,2,~~~
Pathetic service. Constantly drops  poor speed. Takes forever to connect. Always had payment issues they cut our connection a few months in a row even though we had paid due to thier incompetence to manage accounts. Is this 2015? How can you live in one of the largest cities on earth and get such poor internet.~~~,london~~~,2015-05-27~~~,1,1,1,1
To me  BT is a stupid company. If there is no star I will choose no star. First  every charge is so expensive but the service is extremely bad. For example the normal payment per month is £45 something even I didn't use any calls. The speed of the network is not quick under this price. Secondly  the company is overcharge. Once a time  my phone line is broken. Then I phoned the BT customer service I asked the adviser how much of the line need to be fixed. The adviser said maybe just £20 on and off. But I am shocked when I got the bill  the engineer fee is £120 something even the engineer just work less then half an hour   just fixed the broken iron wire. And also I think the company did't say clearly what is international call freedom on the contract. For example I pay £6 per month but I always need to £10-15 per month for the international call. These are two major bad feelings to me so far  all the say I am extremely not happy with this service experience. I think BT is the big broadband company in the uk  even over the city  whey they do such bad service. They should spend time and ideas to improve the service  not how to earn more money from the customers. I want to leave this company now  but I cannot because the contract hasn't been finished. If I want to leave I need to pay £ 200 to cancel the contract. So I have to stay with it. I will definitely leave this company and won't use it any more.  Thank you~~~,Uk~~~,2015-05-26~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are completely useless  and I would most definitely NOT recommend them. After purchasing fibre optic broadband  we had frequent problems with loss of connection. This went on for almost a year.I spent hours upon end contacting BT about the problem. Every time I phoned it was answered by someone in India  and invariably they cannot always understand what you are saying. I was fobbed off with many different reasons for the problem and many different solutions  none of which worked. Eventually it was established that the installation had been done incorrectly and an engineer was sent out to correct it. I asked for some reimbursement and suggested three months worth of the cost of the broadband  totalling approx £75.00. All they would give me was £10.00  and that took a lot of persuading. They are the worst company I have ever dealt with.~~~,East Sussex~~~,2015-05-25~~~,1,1,3,1
Don't even try to switch or sign up for BT... They robbed you... Internet is crap and TV is worst than crap.. You might get 3 channels for 70£...  If you want 50 channels than you have to pay at least 500£ a month.... Best think is when you try to cancel contract with BT... Haha I leave that for you people to experience that ...~~~,wolverhampton~~~,2015-05-24~~~,1,1,1,1
I have  never come across a worse utility company in my life!!! Lies  incompetence  total disregard by staff who care not a jot for you as a customer but  only for themselves and BT. Im self employed and have lost thousands of pounds in lost work since telling them about a house move in january. Eight failed attempts to connect my land line  my computer goes down every time i now use my t/phone and nearly £1 000 taken from my bank account after already speaking with billing and getting an assurance from them that I actually owed ZILCH  I have since stopped paying by direct debit. If you have serious complaints  and I have only scratched the service here  they will lead you down the garden path  hoping you will eventually give up. Go straight to the ombudsman and tell all your friends to never use such a deceitful  inept  CON-firm~~~,norfolk~~~,2015-05-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Moved to BT Infinity from Sky's std broadband.  Expected big increase in speed.  None noticeable. None achieved - despite spending a few hours on the phone. Connection sped averages around 20 Mb with download similar and upload around 4.5 Mb  as confirmed by BT's own speed checker. Will move as soon as the contract ends. BEWARE THEIR SPEED CLAIMS AS THEY'VE NOT DELIVERED THEM FOR ME!~~~,"peebles, scotland~~~",2015-05-22~~~,1,1,1,3
bt are just greedy money grabbers  i got charged £250 + vat to move a wire inside the door frame  it was done shody by a previous bt engineer yet they still charged me for it  beware when reporting faults  i am still fighting it .~~~,london~~~,2015-05-22~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
"I've never felt so ripped off  Broadband Infinity 2 drops out about 10 times a day... BT took £50 from us as without warning for a ""deposit"" and we have to wait 6 months to get it back... It's supposed to be £38 a month and it ends up being closer to £50 for no reason... generally crap  cant wait to leave.~~~","Newark, Nottinghamshire~~~",2015-05-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Gave  my 30 days notice to cancel BT sports  they cut the service the next day owing me 29 days service  which I had paid for  spoke to a guy who told me he was re- instating the 29 days  sounds great  but he did not tell me he was setting up a new account with all the  activation costs involved and would credit my account with some compensation  no money appeared  surprise surprise  glad I had cancelled  my DD  they tried to take an activation fee and subscription for £43...they owed me 29 days service that had already been paid for .... Disgraceful  I will stick with sky sports from now on.....do not bother with BT...~~~,Uk~~~,2015-05-21~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Regarding my review yesterday  thanks to bt technical support  my problem is now solved  so thank you. If anyone else is having trouble with wifi on a smart set  bt sent me two bt extender kits  one for the TV  and one to attach to the bt hub four. The technical support team are excellent.~~~,Lancashire~~~,2015-05-20~~~,5,5,5,5
The most disgusting customer service I have ever experienced. I moved from talk talk thinking that BT had better service and it would make my life easier  what a mistake that was. I was offered a £10 a month contract when I joined but was charged £23 a month in the first month. I have now since spent a month making hours and hours of phone calls trying to resolve this issue  only to be accused of being a lier  on several occasions  by there very poorly trained customer service team based in India who said that I wasn't offered this contract. I have been told on four occasions that someone would call me back which has never happened  and even when I eventually got confirmation that I am on a £10 a month contract  I got a call the next day to say that I wasn't again  and once again accused of making it up. I am so furious I have reported it to trading standards. I cannot stress enough STAY AWAY FROM BT.~~~,BUCKINGHAMSHIRE~~~,2015-05-20~~~,1,1,3,3
Indian office needs education in IT at least to support somehow for now they just sitting there and talking nonsense to people. Every month I have to book an engineer appointment because of connections drops. Worst thing they trying to cover it with Openreach when they are the ones who are useless. People if you have any other offer then BT choose it.~~~,London~~~,2015-05-20~~~,~~~,~~~,2,~~~
The worst broadband order I've ever experienced. I was assured by the BT sales team that an order placed ahead of a flat move would be fine & they'd transition the change of line over without issue  but that original order had to be cancelled 'due to a technical error'. All without informing us of an issue. My next order  after moving  also didn't complete automatically so was passed to 'first line assist' where it has been for a further week. So 2 weeks after moving  3 weeks after originally ordering I've not been contacted to explain the issue or has the issue been resolved. I'm getting tired of calling them to hear the same response.~~~,Chester~~~,2015-05-20~~~,1,2,~~~,~~~
quick to repair faults but speed of broadband is DIABOLICALLY SLOW.Download speed average of 0.468 mb/s over last month~~~,Dihewyd~~~,2015-05-20~~~,1,4,1,4
The bt technical team I have had to speak to several times this week  have always been helpful  polite and really are trying to solve my ongoing problem with wifi connection to smart TV.~~~,Lancashire~~~,2015-05-19~~~,3,5,4,4
I wanted to canacel my BT broadband because I'm paying for it but it's at someone's address I haven't got no paper work or details or account number so they didnt help me or have nothing to fk for me also I am still paying for it for someone els to use.~~~,Norwich ~~~,2015-05-17~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~

This is the worst company I have ever dealt with  I am now at 5 weeks with no internet and have been told just to sit and 'Wait'. The customer services in Dundee are usless and have an attitude that needs to be addressed. Will be cancelling as soon as I can.~~~,Scotland~~~,2015-05-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Bt ithe worst company I have ever dealt with. Their Broadband Help Line Operatives every time I phoned  listen have you do checks confirm the speed you said you had and do nothing.After 3 weeks of hell numerous phone calls  my Infinity 2 speed was still 12Mb/sec. I gave up and am now on a different provider with 50mb/sec. BT useless and I advise every one to move.~~~,longfield~~~,2015-05-14~~~,1,1,1,1
I have now been with bt broadband for total of 2 weeks  switching from sky. It has been the biggest mistake of my life  the home hub 4 is the biggest piece of dung outthere. Never have I had so my devices drop out and stop working. No AirPlay  no remote app for I iTunes  no control of kodi over wifi and a signal strength  half that of a basic sky hub. My sainsburys vouchers are now having to be spent on air port extreme. (What ever the deals is it's not worth swapping)~~~,Parbold~~~,2015-05-13~~~,1,1,2,1
This has been a NIGHTMARE from the word go.  Messed about for a month to even set up basic broadband  misled on phone regarding availability of 'Infinity' in my area. Told by two separate customer service agents that I would be getting the upgraded Infinity for no extra charge. It was then cancelled without my asking and RESOLD to me over the phone by another agent that misled me to believe I was getting a special deal because of how I'd been treated!! One visit to the website made me realise that it was a standard package for existing customers!  I have now been trying to set up BT Sport (the ONLY reason I went with BT in the first place...) for over a week. Speaking to people every day over Twitter  over text  over the phone... '8pm tomorrow'  doesn't happen  I get back in touch...'12 midnight tomorrow'  doesn't happen! 'After the weekend  8pm Monday'... still NO BT SPORT!?  Then the EMAILS!! Multiple emails saying the same thing 'your order has been recieved'  then saying the service had been cancelled  then saying the standard TV package had been ordered....I've been using that for a few weeks already... 8 emails today!!!  Confused yet?? I am.~~~,London~~~,2015-05-13~~~,1,1,3,3
It's quite difficult to give a review about BT broadband  because it's incredible inconsistent.  You will get great speed at one point then painfully slow the next day.  It's not reliable  seems to go down everyday around 1:45 and in the evening around 9:30/11pm and then it might disappear at random points in the week when it feels like it. Haven't used their customer service so have no opinion  I hear it's pretty good though.~~~,Maidstone~~~,2015-05-13~~~,3,3,2,1
It is impossible to say how bad BT is.  Think of the worst service you have ever gotten  then try to imagine something worse.~~~,London~~~,2015-05-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Have had 23 engineers  many promises to fix things and been dealing with England's resolution centres and the highest person responsible to the CEO of BT.I'm still being lied to   being treated like an idiot and this week  was told I had the plug in the hub in the wrong place!!!Broadband has been a joke and BT have been the worst people to deal with that I've ever encountered.Even the top complaints office tells lies promise to ring and don't . It's 8 months on and the fault in the line discovered after 5 different engineers looked for it is still waiting to be repaired.The resolution centres are so busy with complaints that the people you speak to seem to be against me because I've complained.Never get broadband  or phone from BT they are a shambles that couldn't give a dam about their customers.~~~,Felixstowe~~~,2015-05-10~~~,1,1,2,1
"I moved house a year ago where I was on 125MB Virgin Broadband  it worked like a dream. I've been forced to pay BT as they're the only provider where I am at the moment and it's disgraceful. Currently paying for ""up to"" 17MB... I see they use that phrase to cover their backs because I consistently get 2-3MB. My family can't do anything if we're on at the same time. They recently upgraded the village I'm at but have left the one exchange that connects my street  so for the last two months everyone else has been able to upgrade to fiber optic and we're still in the technological stone age! Emailed them to ask when the exchange would be upgraded and got a standard  copy-paste response from some customer service representative who has no appreciation for their job.  If you can get another provider  do it. BT will only bring you frustration.~~~",Cambridgeshire~~~,2015-05-10~~~,1,1,1,1
I wish I had never taken out a package with BT. At first everything was fine. Then my broadband was always running at 3mb. I reported this loads of time and in the end the customer services put me on fibre costing me extra money. My bills where always higher than they should have been which lead to endless calls being made to BT. Alls they try to do is make you spend more money rather than resolving your problem. I have since changed to talktalk who i never have a problem with. The customer service is great and the broadband is out of this world. If your reading this you should take this on board. I was advised not to go to BT from loads of people and i wish i'd taken there advice.~~~,London~~~,2015-05-09~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I current have BT fibre which is always losing connection. Engineers have been and they are okay but never solve the problem long term. The BT sports are always bad quality and never working as they should. Cannot wait until my contracts up in July to leave this awful company!!!~~~,Lancashire~~~,2015-05-09~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
We have had BT Internet for at least a year now and all we get is slow internet and expensive bills for not only the internet but they are charging us for the telly which we have never had and we have explained we don't want to pay for something we don't have but they don't listen and put the phone down on us all the time. They will rob you off your money. The Internet isn't even that good it cuts out 24/7. I would never ever reccomend BT unless you want to pay out lots of money every month for things you shouldn't have to! Rude staff aswell!~~~,Essex~~~,2015-05-09~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
I've been with BT for the past 18 months. BT infinity 2. To be honest it was rather brilliant  beside the price. Initially had some problems to get my Sainsbury voucher but eventually got it and it had promised 100 pounds on it. Broadband was reliable - never had any drops in connection and after setting the router properly I stopped having issues with iPhone connection etc. Router broke once  but I was offered another one in no time. Overall I was very satisfied but I'm gonna leave them because of the price.~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2015-05-08~~~,5,4,5,5
Moved into new property  ordered BT infinity 2 months before moving in  then had to wait another 58 days with no broadband or phone  BT eventually connected us to broadband  and we got a max speed of 2 mb/s 2 weeks later go infinity  and that is a max  of 12 mb/s. BT are trying to charge us for Infinity when we only get broadband speeds  they take money out of out bank account with out notice.Customer service is non existent was with virgin before BT are the worst company I have ever dealt with. They promise  speeds they can no do and when you complain use the old distance from exchange excuse. Believe non of there blurb its all untrue  Open reach are a disgrace and hide behind we are not customer facing story. BT are a total disgrace to the country If you are after broad band stay away from BT and Open reach if you can.~~~,Congleton~~~,2015-05-08~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~

Absolute rubbish in terms of service. BT keep putting my monthly broadband payments up every couple of months. For an example one month I can be paying £38 and the next £65. I have contacted them numerous times in regards to this. I have an unlimited package and I do not use the landline so I do not expect my monthly payments to be fluctuating like this. I have 4 months left on my 18 month contract and then i'm leaving! I cannot wait!~~~,London~~~,2015-05-07~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
In December I had a BT salesperson call me about changing to a different package  as I'm not the account holder I don't have permission to change the package and also turned them down saying I wanted to stay on the current package. In January I received my BT bill which was unreadable due to prices here and discounts there  when my February bill arrived I found the package had changed. I phoned BT to complain and get the original package that we had re-instated to be told that I was not the account holder and I was not authorised to make any changes. The complaint was never registered and it took 3 months of calls to get back to the original package. I've now left BT and will never return.~~~,Hampshire~~~,2015-05-07~~~,1,1,2,2
