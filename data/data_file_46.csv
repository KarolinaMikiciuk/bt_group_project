"Long term customer and you get no favours for that. On the back of some email password sync issues I managed to get a ""deal"" for a better BB service. Should have kicked in days ago and hasn't.  The time I've spent using their online chat support service has redefined abject misery. It took time to even get a response from that but when I did I got nowhere fast. The emphasis seems to be on validating who you are  rather than resolving the problem. I mean who in their right mind would pretend to be someone else  and put themselves through the pain that this so called support service involves? Without boring about details  I usually sit down with a magazine or such  because on average I spent over an hour  and most of that was just that  waiting. Occasionally getting responses such as ""hold on a minute"" or ""the server for that test is taking time"" or ""I'm just checking into that"". They are very good at apologising though. I got that a lot. What has pushed me over the edge is being lied to by these people. I've got transcript evidence of 2  arguably 3 instances in less than a week where promises to email or call me back simply have not happened.  When it got to the point of agreeing an engineer needed to look at things I was then hit with what read like a legal statement about additional costs. Now I know nothing in my home is faulty but the tone of this was appalling and came across in a threatening manner. I firmly advised I will not be paying any extra to get the service I am now paying for. I'd add that the previous BB service I was buying NEVER managed 75% of its so called performance either. Today I will be submitting a formal complaint. Whilst I would prefer to stick with BT as a 1 stop shop for my phone and BB  I honestly do not feel I am dealing with a company that demonstrates good customer focus  nor ability to deliver as promised.~~~",Cheshire~~~,2016-08-26~~~,2,1,2,4
Had BT for 30 years then made the mistake of moving house. Filled in the order online with BT and was told at Midday everything would work in my new house. 2 weeks and 4 phone calls totaling 4 hours to India I got a phone Line. Broadband was another issue after a further 7 weeks and 13 calls to there call centers total 10 hours and every time having to repeat the same details I gave up. Called Sky and They gave me a date 7 days later all was working. Since transferred all my properties away from BT  nightmare.~~~,LARGS~~~,2016-08-26~~~,1,1,1,1
We have had BT for many years. Poor broadband service initially was eventually fixed when they found the problem lay not in our home but in their exchange! Have had consistent 11Mb service with no dropping for years. Now considering moving to fibre but not sure it is worth it or that we will get a better service than now!~~~,Fife~~~,2016-08-25~~~,4,4,5,5
A much slower service than three years ago  but paying more. numerous calls go un-answered and problem ingnored. Very disappointing  but i'm just a small fish in a big pond~~~,"Gayton, King's Lynn~~~",2016-08-25~~~,2,1,1,3
Absolutely appalling called BT to tell them I was moving home and they told me an engineer would be out to my PROPERTY which they never showed up so I called up to see what was going on an they told me an engineer doesn't need to be out when I had wires missing and I also don't know how set it all up  I explained this to BT for 3 days on the run and they sent me the same wire for 3 days. I really don't know how hard it is to send an engineer out to help a customer out!!!!~~~,Liverpool~~~,2016-08-25~~~,1,1,3,3
And absolute disgusting service pay for the full amount and basically get rubbish speed ! Can't believe what I'm paying for ! And it doesn't even work . Keeps dropping out ! Speed is on 3 ! So why do I have to be penalised to pay full amounts! Let's see if the customers service team contact me within 24 hours   bet they don't ! Would be great if they did and would be an added bonus if I could talk to someone British !~~~,Lanner Redruth ~~~,2016-08-24~~~,1,1,1,1
I would not recommend someone I hated to BT worst company I have ever come across I had there over seas billing department mock the way I talk when he thought he had me muted I demanded to speak to a manager who apologised on his behalf If it was me mockin him I would of been called racist and been in trouble. I was meant to have full service on 27th June after hours of phone calls a new router a engineer out i received full speed n channels from 1st August n they want to charge me £194 for 6 weeks bill when I only had service for 15 days disgusting service AVOID~~~,Kent~~~,2016-08-22~~~,1,1,1,1
"BT... what could possibly be the biggest con ever.I have had it for 4 years now with their ""Ultra fast broadband""  but really it never went over 3Mbs of download speed  or 1Mbs of upload speed. No matter how many times I called BT for help  no matter how many times they assured me that ""it'll work perfectly fine 24 hours from now"" after doing what apparently seems like nothing on their side  my broadband is terrible. It seems they are incapable of offering any decent service or internet at all... Go to Virgin media.~~~","Watford, Leggatts Green~~~",2016-08-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Charged me over £80 to cancel my line (my initial contact had finished a few months earlier). Over £50 a month for basic broadband  which wasn't that reliable. Ripoff.~~~,London~~~,2016-08-21~~~,1,2,4,3
"DON'T GET SUCKERED INTO ONE OF BT'S DEALS! I signed up for £5 broadband and £17.99 line rental for 12 months starting in September 2015. In July 2016  they increased the price to £6.10 broadband and £18.99 line rental. When I complained  they told me that they can increase their prices at any time. I seriously doubt the legality of this trick; if you advertise a product at a set price for a set duration  surely the company is legally bound to honour the advertisement or allow you to leave the contract without ""contract termination charges""?~~~",~~~,2016-08-20~~~,1,1,2,2
Rubbish company AVOID we have been trying to get a phone line and broadband at our home for 5 Months now excuse after excuse but still no phone or broadband They contact you to someone in India or Pakistan who place you on hold for 45 mins plus They told me to be in today as an engineer was calling then an email mail stating the engineer didn't need a essential to our home and they had fixed the fault This was around 2pm today it's now 18.43 and guess what not phone nor Internet Please please Avoid bt~~~,Pontefract~~~,2016-08-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Over the last 10 years we've been with Telewest / Blueyonder  O2 / Sky and more recently with BT and BT have proved to be far the worst in terms of quality of broadband (ADSL) and customer service.  The broadband is unreliable and struggles to cope with SD streaming and any other activity  frequently dropping out and requiring a reset. I've followed this up with technical support with little improvement. The Wifi dongle sometimes just cuts out  needing to be unpluigged and reconnected to pick up a signal. To cap it all  our landline stopped receiving incoming calls 2 months ago and counbtless calls - during which I have to repeat the issue every time - it is still not fixed. Unsurprisingly we are cancelling our contract and moving to Virgin. It cannot possibly be worse.~~~,Whitley Bay~~~,2016-08-20~~~,2,2,2,2
"Like the majority of reviews I have just read  BT customer care is more than dreadful. Being in an area that doesn't have fibre  I was told by a lovey chap in the sales department that I would be guaranteed a minimum of 6mbps download speed at all times. As my existin provider (talktalk) were only able to provide me a guarantee of 1mbps  I made the switch. Having never achieved more than 4mbps and spent hours and hours (over 10 hours in the 1st week)on the phone trying to get things sorted  I was transferred needlessly from complaints to faults to cancellation. Every time I said I wanted to cancel as I am within the cooling off period. They deliberately tried to ""fix"" the issue. On day 15  they used the ""you're in contract now for 12 months line"". After finally getting through to someone based in uk  I raised a complaint to management and asked them to listen to the recorded call at point of sale. Having been accused of lying  and being told I am rude  I received a call back saying we are sorry about the issues you have had. Sure enough you were right sir. We will cancel your contract with no charge. All that aggravation for nothing. BT have the most pathetic customer service of any company I have dealt with. No wonder sky get away with their ""believe in better"" slogan.~~~",Egham~~~,2016-08-19~~~,1,1,1,1

Appalling service. We are in Central London and we have not had internet for 3 months. BT sent 4 engineers  2 new hubs  I called them 30 times and they were not able to fix the problem. Also issues in the building with the landlines! Quality of service of the call centre is very poor  they don't care about customer service. We are struggling to get compensation for not having internet for a few months. Extremely disappointed and annoyed.~~~,London~~~,2016-08-18~~~,1,1,3,1
Arrogant abysmal service. Too focused on BT Sport.How on earth do they still have operational control of Openreach when they only meet certain targets and deliberately ignore the little people.I had BT TV with them for years before this obsession with BT Sport happened. Since fibre became available in my city area 5+ years ago I have been trying to get BT to connect the flat complex I live in as it currently has a very poor broadband connection. Typically less than 4 Mbps download and 0.44 Mbps upload. When BT 'upgraded' their TV service it became unuseable as the new service requires a fast broadband connection. I now have a Sky TV subscription as a result of this. I am now going to completely bin BT. Phone line  phone  broadband  TV  Sports  the works and move over to Sky for broadband and phone as well as TV. It will work out about the same total price (including my current Sky TV subscription) as I am currently paying these shysters £34 per month alone  on an abysmal unlimited broadband service. At least by using Sky they will be able to put pressure on these incompetents to maximise the performance of my current line. I will then try to get Sky to apply pressure to get fibre installed. My area is served by the Denburn exchange in Aberdeen and there is no excuse for not providing everyone within this area with fibre broadband.~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2016-08-18~~~,1,1,1,2
Customer service is appalling. Phones only answered promptly when you want to sign up. I cancelled BT sport and I am now outside the notice period but have just been billed for it for the next month. The only answer is for people to start taking BT to the SMALL CLAIMS COURT. Believe me it works. BT are so inefficient they would not attend the hearing....you would get judgment.~~~,england london~~~,2016-08-17~~~,1,1,2,2
BT = British Trash. After reading through other people's reviews  I'm really surprised their rating is overall 3 stars  it should be much lower  and you should give a 0 option just for BT. I've used them a couple of times now and each time their service  broadband and reliability is subpar in comparison to other providers. However  this occasion takes the biscuit. The most unreliable service I've ever used  extremely slow and cutting out several times a day for several hours at a time. So this means they are only providing working broadband service to their consumers for a few hours each day  yet charging full prices. They should be heavily regulated to ensure they are providing their customers with service they advertise  or be fined.~~~,London~~~,2016-08-17~~~,1,~~~,1,1
We moved to a remote part of Warwickshire 4 weeks ago. So wasn't expecting great speeds. Bt took 2 weeks to connect us. It ran for 4 days then went down on the 9th august.I was promised by bt it would be repaired on the 11th  15th and 16th August. ....I'm still waiting...no update from bt of progress...another call and put on hold for another 35 mins I guess....I DON'T RECOMMEND BT!!!~~~,Nuneaton ~~~,2016-08-17~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are COMPLETELY  and UTTERLY disgusting.I am SO dissapointed in their 'service' it feels as if im in some sort of debt with a mafia loanshark thats given me a piece of garbage worth £2 and asked for me to repay them with £90 000 before the end of the month and its the 28th. BT broadband speed is laughable  videos buffer (THIS ISN'T 1998) constant lagspikes  latency in games are in the 200's (to neighbouring countries) and their 'customer service'.Ha. WHAT customer service? They don't even answer their phones!! Router CONSTANTLY cuts out and everything to do with them is just absolutely aggrovating. Don't forget the cancellation fees those loanshark THEIVES try to threaten you with. Bunch of jokers.DON'T get BT.Stabbing yourself in the foot would be an understatement.~~~,England~~~,2016-08-15~~~,1,1,1,1
My partner has been a BT customer for years so when we moved in our new flat this month  we decided to use the BT broadband services. However  the line came on and off all the time in the first three days so we called to cancel the order. Their customer service team sounded very nice and asked us to give another chance for them to investigate  so we did. We arranged a follow up call on the following day and specified due to our working hours we could only receive calls in early mornings. So their team did call back a few times but when we were at work so we missed all the calls  and there was no number for us to call back. Therefore we tried to call back again to cancel the order  then we were told the 14 days free cancellation had been passed (counting from the day we placed order). Then we spent altogether 5 hours calling their teams and got the answer that we either paid a £350 cancellation fee  or waited at home for an engineer to come over to check whether it can be fixed (but again during our working hours!). I am very surprised by their tactics and attitude to deal with their customers in this way.~~~,London~~~,2016-08-15~~~,1,1,1,1
"BT is the worst company I have ever had to deal with. I have taken out a contract for fibre optic broadband  TV and phone. As planned  BT disconnected my old provider 2 weeks ago  but have not reconnected us. The phone works partially....but no internet and no TV. They won't tell us a connection date....the phone centre staff in India are beyond useless. They refuse to cancel the contract until the Internet is connected (I don't know why)  but can't tell us when it will happen  but will charge us if we do then cancel!!!! So we are stuck with no internet  no TV and can only buy ourselves out of the contract when (if) they finally do manage to connect us. The also refuse to set up a temporary non-fibre internet connection to keep us going. The attitude is "" we have disconnected you and there's nothing you can do about it  we are not going to help out in any way all or bother to find out what is going wrong  we are not even going to bother contacting you to let you know there is a problem  you will have to spend an hour of your own time on hold waiting to speak to us  and we will then tell you that we won't be doing anything to fix the problem for at least two weeks  now please stop bothering us""~~~",London~~~,2016-08-14~~~,1,1,1,1
broadband is expensive at £40/month for infinity max  but work well and is reliable. I am however very upset to have discovered a little clause hidden in section 13 of the Terms and Conditions: even if you are not on a fixed term contract  if you move and don't want to take BT with you you will be charged  in my case £31. So beware when comparing prices...~~~,manchester~~~,2016-08-13~~~,2,1,5,5
customer service is just so bad it is unreal. Broardband reliability is good its always on just crap speeds are not as they say the poor customer service team keep telling me you have good speeds.

BT – Bloody Terrible We have been with Sky for 5 years now and have had no cause to contact them during this time. If an outage occurs they text me to inform me that they are aware of a problem in the area. Total downtime over 5 years no more than 10 minutes.We left BT (for good) in 2011 as a direct consequence of their extremely poor customer service. It doesn’t look as though they learnt a damned thing in all this time.  Skavar~~~,Hertfordshire~~~,2016-08-13~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been a loyal customer of Bt since 1996.I have up to now not complained but I feel I must tell others how I rate BT.Our internet has always been slow but within the past year it has been dreadful.I can't watch any utube Facebook videos as it keeps pausing.I tried ringing Bt forty minutes later I eventually got through.I went with their protocol and was promised that speed with get better.I am still waiting as nothing has improved.I have tried ringing them again but again can't get in touch with BT unless I have another forty minutes to wait listening to We are experiencing a high number of calls please wait?I now understand the reason that everytime I call to complain that the line is busy as I am paying full price for a service that isn't fit for purpose.I am on the lookout for a new provider but very disappointed in BT overall.~~~,Mayobridge~~~,2016-08-12~~~,1,1,1,1
So  I am one of those people who read the reviews about BT before signing up  I thought  it can't be that bad surely! The sales team I called were great and I got a good deal online with some cash back. I had fibre unlimited 2 broadband and TV with an extra box. I have just paid £135 to cancel my contact as BT are genuinely the worst company I have had to deal with in years. The broadband wouldn't let me watch videos on YouTube from my phone (stood right next to the box!) without pausing. In the end I upped the allowance on my 4G phone contract so I could. The TV service is ok  it worked at least.Now  on to the customer service  when you get through after 40 minutes you are greeted by someone who completely misinterprets what you are asking and tells you point blank that you 'are wrong sir' after explaining for 30 seconds after the assistant constantly interrupted it turns out I was right! No apology from the person I spoke to and no follow up from a complaint I made about over charging. There is a reason BT has such poor reviews  it's because it is genuinely terrible and those giving bad reviews are sharing their personal experience. Which on the whole is abysmal.  I will never go with BT again and strongly urge you not to.~~~,Sutton coldfield~~~,2016-08-12~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are to big  they don't appear to be interest in home support .~~~,Worcester ~~~,2016-08-11~~~,1,2,1,3
I have to say I didnt think BT customer service  could get worse. It is appalling.  I have spent 3 hours today on hold;30 minutes talking to someone who clearly didn't understand the technology and couldn't speak English sufficiently well.  This is the worst customer experience I can recall. Bar none.~~~,Manchester~~~,2016-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely shocking service all round  have been without broadband now for 2 days  they are advising me it could be another 3 days before I receive a call back to get it resolved. It is a complete lottery if you get anyone that knows what they are talking about when it comes to broadband faults. If you are a new customer looking for a broadband provider I would advise that you avoid BT at all costs.~~~,lancashire~~~,2016-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Used to have speed of 1.4 mb year ago. Now lucky to get 0.7. Often 0.5 or below. Over a year and no sign of BT resolving speed or upgrading to fibre. will have pay out for satalite~~~,~~~,2016-08-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Waited for 2 months with no internet  spoke to the clueless and useless customer service team about 100 times to no avail. Eventually cancelled and they refused to refund me.

Wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy; a worse service would not be possible.~~~,Leeds~~~,2016-08-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Do not go with this company!!! Customer service is the worst I've ever seen or dealt with! Every time you speak to someone  it's either the wrong information giving or doesn't get logged. Each advisor tells you different things each time you phone and has you believing everything is sorted for you to later find out it isn't. Then they make out your the lier because they haven't taken any record of your call. Even the managers are no help  they don't even call you back when they said they would. The worst company!!!!!! Never will I be using them again!!~~~,Glasgow ~~~,2016-08-09~~~,1,1,3,5

Rubbish i thought bt said they would have english call centre so they would understand you. Speak 15minutes repeating myself because they dont understand and all i wanted was past paper bill that i pay for and should have been sent for last 6 months and havent. They couldnt explain why my bill per month is £30more she just kept repeating if ur bill has gone up. Yes but why it should not have gone up my bill is unlimited broadband   so round and round we go i got no where. Go on line no do ur job and find out why no. Just pay bt  and do all the qork yourself when there is a problem. What are we paying for??? I still got no where with foreign and completely useless staff.

Absolutely awful  the broad band it self is disconecting contunuesly every couple of hours  so i thouhg it might be the hubs foult since it's not the newest one  so i ordered the latest (5 smart hub) so i have been told that this should eliminate the problem that im having. So the new hub came in after 2 weeks of calling and ordering it  since my order keeps missing. Everything worked fine for 1 (one)!!!day... then it just startet to show green light (witch means hub is starting). AGAIN  called for technical support and after 3h of talking they sent me  a replacement. WHICH AGAIN was missing so after another 2weeks about 10 calls and aprox 10h on holds 3 placed orders and talking to numerous people i'm still waiting for a replacement.Thanks BT! So if you're considering to get a contract at BT  take further consideration!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~,London~~~,2016-08-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Why did we do it? This has ben the worst 12 months ever as far as phone and broadband go. Switched because it looked a good deal but they never met their contract promises. Average speed was .98. Tried to get out but they wanted to charge a stupid amount despite their failure to honour supply.Service appalling an appointments never honoured. service due to be switched midnight 5th so they turned us off 18 hrs early!!! then wanted an extra charge to reconnect!! Thanks to new provider our business only suffered 4hrs loss. WARNING DON'T USE BT words fail me but inept useless come to mind.~~~,Essex~~~,2016-08-05~~~,1,1,1,1
