£50/ month - Slow connection  connection dropped everyday. And yes I did report the fault. I have been woth the company for 2 years now and nothing changes. It’s almost everyday now that I am struggling with this. Still this is not a good internet company provider~~~,Manchester ~~~,2018-02-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Returned to BT for phone services after trouble with Talktalk and for broadband when free serve died. All was fine for a year or so  then got charged for BT sport which I expressly states I didn’t want  I managed to get a 50% refund and will never trust BT again (this was common practice and BR were fined by Ofcom for malpractice). Since then I have had numerous faults with noisy  crackly and intermittent phone line and unstable broadband. Despite hours on the phone  6 engineer visits( one of which didn’t arrive)  and a massive collection of data about broadband and phone stats  8 months on I am no better off. It took 6 months for my fault to be escalated so I didn’t have to repeat myself each time I called the Help desk  the fault is now managed personally by a very helpful manager but she is hamstrung by the disastrous BT fault management procedure. I am now out of contract and paying a fortune for a disastrous service  but don’t feel I can leave whilst there is a fault as who ever I move to will still use theBT Openreach lines and I’ll have to start all over again.In summary  untrustworthy with sharp practices  incompetent  unreliable and poor value for money. Avoid like the plague.~~~,Harrow~~~,2018-02-18~~~,1,2,2,1
Totally  totally useless. We ordered our service 3  weeks and a month later nothing  Crap provider. I would NOT recommend BT to my worst enemy. Shocking  atrocious service. Please do go somewhere else.~~~,E7~~~,2018-02-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Total disgrace again by BT. Dealing with them since October. Indian call centre. Nobody know what they are doing.  You have now lost our shop account as well.  Should not be allowed to trade. All blame each other all the time.~~~,Edinburgh ~~~,2018-02-17~~~,1,1,1,1
I would not give even 1 star. Horrible customer service. Do not deal with a complaint either. Wasted hours on the phone with them to find out that they have no idea what happened with my order  transfering to all departments where one person state that the order was cancelled and the next person telling that is still active. Wasted hours last week. AVOID!!!~~~,~~~,2018-02-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Worst ever service and broadband you can get. BT likes to do nothing but are very happy to send you stupid invoices for a service they do not provide! Avoid at all time. Not reliable  Unfriendly and arrogant! Avoid this company! An absolute disgrace!~~~,Craigantlet~~~,2018-02-13~~~,1,1,1,1
"Had an email from BT to say that local exchange had been upgraded for more stability and possibly more speed. TWO WEEKS LATER my speed is still a quarter of what it previously was - and that was stupidly low - despite calls to and from ""managers"" (piss-up/brewery style) in UK and in India AND two Openreach engineer visits. All personnel charming and helpful but the dots aren't joined-up  right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing. Result - frustration  loss of work  wasted hours. IF ONLY there were an alternative in this rural area - but all rivals use BT's copper lines and we're too far away for the village's fibre. What irks me most is the fact that we've had FIVE Mbps here in the past and now we're down to 0.6 despite NO new subscribers in our area.~~~",WR6~~~,2018-02-13~~~,1,1,1,1
I have claimed that broadband speed I very slow.They keep agreeing it's slow and they are working on it  this has been going on for over four weeks   it's still the same.~~~,Dougie.~~~,2018-02-13~~~,3,3,1,3
BT Infinty is really good - the kit is really well packaged  simple to set up and performance is good and stable.Fundamentally good product makes up for the wacky world of BT customer service - perseverence is the key - keep going till you find someone sensible to talk to and ignore the muppets (eg the nice man who advised we had a problem with the underground pole). So far all has eventually come good in the end.~~~,TURVEY~~~,2018-02-11~~~,5,4,5,4
Not happy with this company  lost my Samsung galaxy 8 with my BT mobile sim contract inside as i used this sim with my handset witch did come from another network but used BT  when i lost my handset my insurance asked for proof of usage witch BT could not give me they had poor excuses to why they couldnt give this info witch i believe they should be as sim was used with that handset in question  i was told till blue in the face they could not provide proof of usage strangely  witch has now caused me big issues with getting my handset replaced by insurance no proof of usage no claim. so now im at a big loss of a £750 handset i cant replace and stuck in a 2 year contract paying £44 a month with no handset  no thanks to BT mobile not providing the appropriate info for my insurance company  when i mentioned court action bt all of a sudden managed to produce documents out of the blue witch did not even gel with my claim  so i believe this is made up and it come across very suspicious i am now forced with having to take court action at a cost to me  as a autism suffer and suffer of Asperger's i found my ordeal very very frustrating and distressing i have been without a handset since Oct now while dealing with this and every day my mental health gets effected and now forced to buy out for a new handset. i believe BT mobile to be liable in this case and having to take them and others to court over this now  id stay well clear of BT for mobile phones they have a poor reaction to customers issues and cant even do the simplest of things and unless you want to lose out i wouldnt even go there. not worth the stresses or action that has to be taken after dealing with them i also managed to gather over £50 worth of phone call charges to my home phone in relations to all contact to companies about issues revolving this. very upset customer and will never use BT again or advise people to go with them. I also had to go through the Ombudsman who sided with my insurance company and denied my claim due to no proof of usage so i feel BT are at fault and liable and act very suspiciously  i had to go through reconsideration with insurance and the ombudsman companies all to a fail due to one simple bit of info BT wont and say cant provide. Soon as a sim is put in to a handset that network is aware and details are logged of this imei number and with that number states what phone is used so why they cant do what other networks do is beyond me.~~~,Canterbury~~~,2018-02-11~~~,1,1,2,3
You sign up to an expensive 24 month contract with the first year prepaid. They hike the price after 12 months tell you you received an email 10 months in informing you of the price hike and giving you the option to leave. You show you didn't receive the email and they say this is an issue for you and your email service provider. It will cost you £300 to leave the new price hiked contact that you are locked into. BT is as scam and once I get out I will never use the again. Furious :(~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2018-02-10~~~,1,1,1,1
"My Broadband speed is pathetic  so I went on line (again) to see if BT fibreoptic Infinity  was available as several months ago  cable was laid. The checker said ""Yes its available"" I went through the ""deal"" page ordered the fastest package  then with it in my basket it said ""Not available in your area"". Dear BT  as is said by teachers ""You have plenty of room for improvement""~~~",PE32 1JJ~~~,2018-02-10~~~,2,3,1,1
I put one star because I couldn't choose none. Absolute rubbish. Don't do what they say  don't deliver. In a new build  still no land line since September (5 months now) and no Internet since December (2 months) and we are still paying... A few engineers came to fix the broadband and connected us to the network of our neighbours to finally remove the connection as not set-up correctly. Still awaiting for some update  they cannot be bothered to tell us what is going on. Simply the worst customer service I have ever seen. I couldn't care less that they understand how frustrated it may be to spend hours on the phone to simply get an update. Stay away!!!!!!~~~,Uttoxeter~~~,2018-02-09~~~,1,1,1,1
My WiFi with Bt use to be the best in my town until some baboon who worked for Bt tried to put my neighbours enternet in and broke our and only came back the next day to fix it.   I was quite annoyed with this because when they did fix it my WiFi is really slow and they do not want to come out and look at it or give us a solution.~~~,~~~,2018-02-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute crap  can not wait to get out of this contract   which they keep changing their minds when that is. got a package for £36 a month but often get billed £85 for using the phone a hand full of times. Too expensive in this day and age  will be using my mobile from now on instead of landline.~~~,Newquay~~~,2018-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Signed to Bt internet and within a couple of weeks of joining the internet connection became unreliable  often cutting out  slowing down and now we have been without wifi for over 2 weeks. We have made 3 appointments and every engineer visit has been a no show. Completely unacceptable customer service team  who are unable to provide appointment commitments they can keep  to remain calm or to give reasons for the engineers not showing up. DO NOT JOIN BT!~~~,London~~~,2018-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
I had standard BT broadband with a speed of 2mbps  I contacted BT who said if I up grade to infinity I would get a minimum speed of 17 Mbps. I upgraded and only received a speed of 10 Mbps approx. I contacted BT several times and had line checks done and a visit from a engineer who said due to my location I was lucky to get a speed of 10 Mbps. On contacted BT again several times they would still not admit miss selling me the contract. I then contacted the ombudsman who found BT at fault for miss selling  said I could leave the contract with out penalty  have £40 debited to my account and 1 month broad band free of charge. BT now want to charge me £317.20 for leaving my contract early even though I have sorted another BT contract for infinity and the ombudsman has instructed them that I could leave without penalty. They are a complete joke  the service is a joke  there departments don't speak to each other  some of the staff(not all) are rude and ignorant  I really can't think of one reason why I would recommend BT.~~~,"Northwick, Bristol~~~",2018-02-05~~~,1,1,1,2
Awful customer service. Foolishly signed up to them after being told I would be able to upgrade for a low price when fibre was available. Now told my unusable slow broadband is what I am stuck with unless I pay a large fee to switch to fiber~~~,Swansea~~~,2018-02-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Price constantly rises  indifferent and unreliable service. The only efficient thing about their service is the dependability of getting a bill~~~,"Grateley, Hampshire~~~",2018-02-04~~~,2,3,3,2
Being able to see a Superfast Broadband green box from my window  yet only being able to receive 0.3Mb/sec is hugely frustrating. Our BT Broadband service is intermittent at best  dropping out at least 20-30 times each day! We have complained to BT so many times  several OpenReach and contractors have visited  assessed and concluded there is a fault between us and the exchange 4 miles away but in their opinion it'll never get addressed as the main road to Malmesbury from M4/J17 will require major disruption to repair/replace the damaged areas - which apparently there are lots of!~~~,Stanton St Quintin~~~,2018-02-04~~~,1,1,1,1
After signing up to broadband in the January deals which came with an awards card  they saying they could take over an exsisting phone line which was great  I would have broadband in two weeks  a week later they cancelled the order and said they couldn’t as the phone line was linked to another provider which was strange as the previous owner took their provider with them two weeks prior  I rang up and was promised fast tracking to hopefully get the broadband on the original date and I could still get the deal I was promised I just had to book it through the advisor  they then hung up and I was left confused  I rang back up and none of this was possible  A complaint went in and went to the offline team to investigate hoping they would honour what they promised after listening to the phone call  I had a phone call from the offline team just to say sorry  nothing else  pointless  if you want false promises and useless staff  BT is for you!!~~~,Stockport~~~,2018-02-03~~~,1,1,1,1
absolute pile of junk  i got wifi so i could watch a few films etc  even with full signal all movies constantly buffering  customer service couldnt even find my account  now im stuck for 12 mths  on a crap network with no signal and to top it all they tell you if you cancel you will have to pay the whole 12 mths what a cheek .~~~,truro~~~,2018-02-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Sailing into third week without broadband. No one at BT seems to have a clue. Engineer has been out (spent 3 hours 'fixing' something. Was told all we had to do was call BT to resolve it their end. Here we are nearly 5 days later  still waiting for BT wholesale to assign and engineer. I'd move service provider at a heartbeat if they weren't going to get me on charges.~~~,Kent~~~,2018-02-01~~~,1,1,3,1
Worst Customer Service ever  rang because my contract was changed without me being notified. got told an email was sent out but I have never received an email from BT. so now they want me to prove that I have never received the email and tried to make it like I did and was trying to get out the contract. worst part was he declined that I should speak with his manager saying he knows more than his manager  which is probably the case. Now I have to wait a week to receive a deadlock letter. He sounded so rude on the phone like he was not happy working there. quit if unhappy mate.~~~,Wakefield~~~,2018-01-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have now placed an order for fibre broadband with BT 4 times. The first two orders apparently didn't reach the engineers (I need fibre cable installing to my property). The only way I discovered this was because I called them to check on progress. The third attempt looked good  I received confirmation email almost immediately. Within 24 hours I then received another email saying the engineers needed to conduct a survey and therefore I had to change the installation date. Each application takes almost an hour  so by then I had lost 3 hours of my life. So I cancelled. As I can only get fibre cable to my property by applying through BT  I tried again yesterday; order placed after a mere 45 minutes. I have still to receive the confirmation email which I was assured would be with me almost immediately. I am therefore confident this fourth order is not progressing but can I be arsed to chase them yet again? No. I'll stick with Talktalk and their abysmally slow broadband speed  but at least they are competent.~~~,Bury St. Edmunds~~~,2018-01-31~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Attempted to switch to BT because of a very good money back deal. A painful month followed of phone calls to their customer service line and 3 wait in all day visits. One of which they didnt turn up for. Appalling customer care. Just don't do it.~~~,Poole~~~,2018-01-31~~~,1,1,1,1
I have made lots of poor mistakes in my life  but joining BT is one of the worst. I was a customer with TalkTalk for 10 years and very few issues with them.  Unless you want to constantly lied to you than join BT. Over connection issues I have rung BT numerous times and they always give different answers. Every single time you have to explain the whole situation as they do not update the accounts.   I have been waiting 1 month and half to get my landline and broadband installed in Wembley and they have not even started yet!!! Please  do not join BT!!!~~~,London~~~,2018-01-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Would NOT recommend BT AT ALL!!!! Money grabbing!!! Don’t look after their customers get them into a contact to TRAP!!!!!!!! them. Their an absolute joke. Asked to contact me through post if any changes so I can have that ‘30’ day cancellation time but nope still contact me through email knowing fullwell I don’t use it and I just gave it to them to sign me up with. Now they have emailed me NOT sent me a letter through post. Trapped me now but you think I’ll EVER come back you’re having a laugh. To the staff on the phones keep working for a joke of a company~~~,Colchester~~~,2018-01-30~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

"Would not recommend BT. Have been a broadband customer since May 2017  just moved house to be hit with a load of trouble from BT. I have been paying for internet for over a month now and been unable to use it. It took them over 2 weeks (of cancelling our appointments on several occaisions  which may I add myself and my partner had to book time off work to fit around these appointments  only to be told on the day they are now not coming) just to get our line up and running. Now the line is finally up and running  the BT box is just flashing purple and not working. We have tried online chat several times to which we get told ""We will calll you tomorrow"" only to not recieve a call and have to go through the whole process again  in which still now we are waiting for a phonecall! We get text messages claiming they have called us and can't get through  however  no missed calls on our call logs. If something isnt done immediately  we are going to take the matter into our own hands and seek legal expertise advice. My partner and I can both work from home and are unable to due to the lack of Wi-Fi  which we pay £35 a month for  RIP OFF!!~~~",St Helens~~~,2018-01-29~~~,1,1,3,3
Up until last month I never had a problem with the company  then I had to move house. This is where all the problems started.I moved End of December  to then get told I have to wait 24 days for an engineer to come out  so I booked the day off work and the day comes around for me to then look online to see they had cancelled my engineer. I contact them  they then re-schedule (so I had to take yet another UNPAID day off). There excuse was that they activated a line (which i never had). So the reschedule date was 2 days after. The engineer came  struggled to locate the ports  asked my partner where she thought it may be  drilled 2 massive holes straight through my wall  to figure that the ports wasn’t correct. (Partially filled them up).Eventually the engineer located a smashed up port box  fitted a new one and connected everything up. But STILL the internet didn’t work  I contacted BT online support once a day for 3 days  each day they said they tried contacting me on my old number (which I updated 3 times)!!!! The last attempt they said they would call me within the next few hours - which they didn’t. Figures there is a network fault on their side. Too add onto it all they have put extra charges on my bill for internet that I’ve not been able to use! Oh and also  BT support needs fluent English speaking phone operators cause all 3 that dealt with my case didn’t have a clue what I was talking about (and apparently didn’t know how to update phone numbers) If you want good customer service and problems to get solved quickly go somewhere else as British Telecoms are shocking!!!!!!~~~,Haydock~~~,2018-01-29~~~,1,1,3,3
Used to use BT fibre optic at my old property. Speeds were running low alot of the time. Called up to report a problem and they talked me through it on the phone. I fixed it myself then they still sent an engineer and billed me anyway £152. The engineer wasn't needed but they still sent him and charged me for it. Do not waste your time with this company absolute rip off.~~~,Draycott Derby~~~,2018-01-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I have had terrible customer service from BT and have now been without home broadband for six weeks. They are very hard to speak to  and almost impossible to understand. Two engineers visits  and two failed appointment when nobody bothered to tell me of non attendance  and still no progress. BT not to be recommended.~~~,Surrey~~~,2018-01-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Left BY after many painful (really painful) years. Even transferred to a business account in the hope of getting better customer service. Over a year my broadband speed degraded from 15 megs (for the previous 2 years) to 8 Megs. BT maintained this was the 'New' operating level. Left for John Lewis Broadband and after 3 months and 3 engineers visits (without talking to any overseas call centres) and relatively painless communication with JLB my broadbamd restored to 18 meg connection. Shame on u BT!~~~,Kings Lynn~~~,2018-01-26~~~,3,2,1,3
Having been with BT twice over two separate 12 month periods  I have to say the company as a whole is TERRIBLE. I have no idea how the staff pay structure works but I am going to guess that they get a financial incentive to extend or sign up customers to longer contracts.  My first experience was that I had ordered broadband  and having not received my hub on the date given  I called up and asked. Only then to find two boxes arrived. I called up and spoke to an Indian call centre to find he has signed me up for a new contract. This happens 4 times over a 6 week period. I had 4 running contracts running at the same time and was a huge ache to then revert back to my original sign up date  as all they wanted to do was start my contract date from the last one they had wrongly issued me. On my most recent experience  having signed up for a 12 month contract  I had problems with my speeds and called them after a week. They said they will give me the faster service (for £x extra) which I agreed to. That was pretty much it. When it come to cancel my 12 month contract  I was informed that I had agreed to sign up for an 18 month contract when my speed was increased. Something not mentioned once.  There is no integrity in the staff whom represent this shocking company.  Speeds are ok but intermittent. Customer services is cr4p~~~,Essex~~~,2018-01-24~~~,~~~,~~~,3,2
Constantly cuts out  customer services takes an age to contact and when you do get through they are absolutely hopeless. Only with them to get BT Sport  changing to another provider next available opportunity. Poor product  terrible service.~~~,Berkshire~~~,2018-01-24~~~,2,1,3,1
Moved into my new house had bt setup my broadband fine no problem 1 week later they cut off my broadband for no reason at all when I rang they said that they had tried to reactivate the line and cocked it up I would have to wait 72 hours for a specialist team to call 1 week later still no call so I phone bt they put me on hold and cut me off five times when I finally got to speak to someone they said I will have to wait another week for a engineer and they would charge me 130 pound luckily for me I was still in cool down period needless to say I have now canceled bt and am waiting for virgin to set me up next week.customer service from bt is none existent please do not even think of using bt they are a disgrace any other company is better~~~,uk gloucester~~~,2018-01-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible. Slow and expensive. Infinity signal does not even go from one side of our house to the other. Unable to send e-mails since installation (can receive).I work from home often  but broadband keeps cutting out half way through quote  so have to keep starting again.Installing engineer was extremely rude to us and our neighbours  called them a four letter word. Made complaint but this was not followed up.~~~,Fleet~~~,2018-01-23~~~,1,1,1,1
