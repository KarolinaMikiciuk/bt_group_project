Do NOT use BT  there inability to conduct a home move order and successfully complete is astonishing! An active line that gave previous tenants internet and phone at fibre speed seems impossible for BT to takeover? They promised a new line at no cost then cancelled that order too  I’ve been over a month waiting and 8 cancellations. They promise to call you back but not once have I had a callback I have always had to call them. The latest call took over an hour with no change on the order. I would highly recommend you look elsewhere  the  perceived reliability of BT is unfounded and it is not worth your time and effort. Pay more for someone else if you must  just don’t trust them with anything.~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2019-06-28~~~,1,2,4,1
Disgusted to find my son is paying £58 per month for his broadband.    For sure he will not renew and neither will I.    Thats two customers lost and I'll try to persuade others to change.~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2019-06-27~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
Ilana’s customer service today was brilliant - clear explanation  took 12 minutes to handle what I anticipated could take 1-2 hours. Thank you for what is clear dedication to your customers!! Could not fault.~~~,Newcastle ~~~,2019-06-25~~~,5,5,5,5
They don't even deserve 1 star! What an absolute mess of a company  lie after lie after lie  zero communication with openreach to get line sorted had them land up 3 times without even knowing there was any appointment  been without Internet for over 2 weeks now the original start date was at the start of the month and they just keep telling me utter *****. Absolute joke! I will be swapping providers ASAP! And this was just the tip of the iceberg don't get me going on the whole rewards crap and moving address! DO NOT USE THEM!~~~,Cumbria~~~,2019-06-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Once again I have apparently forgotten my login details to BT when I have them sat in front of me! So once again when I have really important e mails to gat off my service is rubbish!  & months I have endured this pathetic performance which I am paying through the teeth for. I' off that's another dissatisfied customer you have lost~~~,Devon~~~,2019-06-25~~~,2,1,3,2
Please stay away from BT. Awful company. Lost my order twice  spent hours on the phone trying to sort it out. Lied to on several occasions. Phoned to cancel within the cooling off period as I was very annoyed. Told by customer services that as a gesture of goodwill my contract would be reduced to 12 months from 18. After 11 months  I phone to cancel and apparently there is no record of this conversation in my notes or on my file. I have 'superfast' broadband at 13mbps (the lowest speed guaranteed in my contract) - my previous provider was standard fibre which was faster. One positive is that it has been pretty reliable.  I will never touch BT again and will tell everyone I know not to either.~~~,Essex~~~,2019-06-23~~~,1,1,2,3
Been with bt for 6 month and had problems with speeds and drop outs constantly  after numerous amounts of engineers and phone calls they have finally sorted the speed out but the constant drop outs make this pointless. After deciding enough is enough I rang them to terminate my contract due to them failing to provide  I got told it would cost £300 by the rudest woman I've ever spoke to  I've now took the situation further.~~~,Doncaster ~~~,2019-06-23~~~,1,3,1,1
Appalling Customer Service; 'take the money and run attitude'.Poor email host with no support whatever. SHOCKINGLY SLOW SPEED.Terrible Overseas polite but brainless helpdesk IF you can even contact BT!Everything that is wrong with Globalisation but with nice shiny 'we are family  love puppies and care about YOU' Advertising campaigns to keep sucking us in!~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2019-06-23~~~,1,1,1,3
Absolutely terrible provider. Have run tests over 30 days and I have not received above 33mb but pay for 64mb. 1 minute it is fine and the next it will slow down to below 1mb at times. I 100% will be contacting the ombudsman to have the contract contested.~~~,Nuneaton~~~,2019-06-23~~~,~~~,2,2,~~~
"BT are a disgrace to the British telecommunications industry. I recently discovered that I was paying £40 a month for an ADSL line. On a separate bill I was being charged £240 a year for the line rental. Meanwhile my internet connection kept dropping off  so I decided to take the plunge an upgrade to BT's Superfast Fibre. You would think that as an exiting customer with a working BT landline that might be a simple enough process. Ring up  choose a package  pay for it?You must be joking. I was on the phone to BT for a total of 99 minutes that day.After some discussion as to what I wanted and selecting the package and agreeing the price (£39.99 a month) I was told by the salesman that because I had just consolidated two accounts he couldn't process the order for 48 hours. We arranged a time 2 days later when he would call me to process the order. Needless to say he didn't call and after sending him an email a colleague of his rang.The colleague then told me that he needed to transfer me to a different department as I was a business customer. I then began the whole process again with a woman who told me that the price offered to me (and which I could see online)was only available to new customers. So for being a BT customer for 33 years I have to pay more.Eventually when I told her that I was not prepared to pay £50 a month and had already agreed £39.99 she said that she would process the order at that price.Then she told me that there was a problem processing the order; she needed to place it with the ""back room team"" who were not available as it was a Saturday.I was told that they would e-mail me confirmation of the order no earlier than Monday of the following week.By Wednesday I had heard nothing so I rung BT and had two calls each over 40 minutes. Having again agreed the package and the price I was put on hold. Minutes passed and whilst idling on the phone I started looking at other providers and discovered that Zen offered a faster fibre bb at the same price with a guarantee of no increase at the end of the contract.So when the BT salesman finally returned to me to say that he was ready to place the order  I told him that I was sorry but had had enough of BT and would be going elsewhere. No order was placed and I bid BT farewell - or so I thought.After placing the order with Zen I was told by them that there was an open order on my line. That was a week ago. Since then I've been batted back and forth between Zen and BT - the former saying they can't process my order because of the open order on the line  BT denying that any such order exists. Last week  in one such call  I was transferred to Kevin in the Loyalty Section of BT who told me that he was able to offer me the same package at £29.99.I told him that it was too late for that  I'd had my fill of BT. I've had several conversations with BT over the last few days all insisting there is no impediment on the line that would stop the transfer. Meanwhile I have had a letter and an email from BT thanking me advising me that my new fibre broadband is on its way from them. When I ring to ask what these messages are about  they say it's just a computer generated letter  and again swear blind that no order exists. It's impossible to find out who is at fault here  but I can see no reason why Zen would be giving me false information  whereas I am getting every indication from BT that they are frustrating the process of transfer as best they can. I haven't gone into the detail of some of the utter stupidity of what they are telling me  the fact that you can never speak to the same person twice  the fact that they cannot transfer calls internally  that they cannot send you an email on an address that can be replied to; the fact they they sign emails with a name that is not in fact their name (eg. Mike Lincoln is Mike who works in Lincoln). All of this designed to make sure that you can never get back to the person who had assured you that they were on your case. Just a horrible sick joke of a company.~~~",London~~~,2019-06-19~~~,1,1,1,1
promised fibre broadband was available in our new home however BT engineers say we are too far away from the distribution box. called BT and they said we were still eligible for fibre broadband. very poor customer serviceCurrently have ADSL speeds of 1.6~~~,Sandhoe Hexham~~~,2019-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful  awful  AWFUL network  they set you up with a contract and little by little make your internet speed worse and worse  they promise good speedy internet (which just isn’t what they provide) and then they expect you to pay £400 to get out of the contract  it’s a cheap scam and no one should deal with internet like this  disgrace and embarrassing company~~~,Meltham~~~,2019-06-17~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been a business customer for several years with BT and had the worst experience ever. For a few months I had one constant issue with BT business broadband in connecting to my card machine which is a lifeline to my business a lot of customers do not carry cash so after they dined and wanted to pay  they had to walk quite far to use an atm and a few times customers did not return to pay. I phoned BT faults department and they would take me through a few procedures to reset the connection and after a few attempts the fault re-emerged ‘Connection failed ‘. I contacted World Pay card machine provider and over the few months they changed the card machine twice in an attempt to see if it’s their machines are faulty. This was not the case and World Pay kept asking me to contact my internet provider (BT) I had enough of this constant issue that I decided to change internet provider and giving BT a months notice to terminate my contract. I was furious when I received my final bill payment and BT charging me an extra month for leaving  when I contacted BT about this they said there’s nothing they can do as they don’t have any record of any previous complaints. After wasting so much of time and effort to try to resolve the issue and to remain with BT this is what I get offered a £30 reduction  it’s an insult to all I have been through . I have never experienced such a bad level of service and this is a warning to all and specially businesses to keep their distance from BT. I find it an irony that when one calls BT one is constantly reminded that the phone calls could be recorded for customer service.~~~,London ~~~,2019-06-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible experience.  We received our router and set it up but the service didnt start on the date promised. Many calls later we were told that they forgot to add our address to the system.  They cancelled our order and said that they would add it to our account again and start the service the next day.  This didn't happen. Weeks and many phone calls later they still haven't sorted out our internet. On top of this they're threatening to charge us for the BT Hub that they sent us! It's not my fault they haven't set up the service on their system yet. Appalling.~~~,~~~,2019-06-07~~~,1,1,1,1
BT has been amazingin both advertised and achieved speeds (currently getting 82/18 on Infinity unlimited)  as well as reliability. I have literally forgotten when the last time my internet connection was down due to a fault.HOWEVER; a huge caveat is that I'm using my own router. I consider the router that BT offers to be extremely subpar in router specific functions. I'm not talking about wireless signal or USB ports  I'm talking about routing; WAN  NAT  DMZ  internal bandwidth  portforwarding and the stuff that routers need to do! In all of these  the BT routers are not suitable.Same goes for their support. It is one of the least helpful and cooperative I've encountered  so it is a great pleasure to me that the reliability of the line is so great as I've only ever needed to call them once in 7 years  and that was NOT to discuss connectivity  but router problems.Provided you have your own good router  BT is a dream.~~~,Hayes~~~,2019-06-06~~~,5,1,5,5
Terrible:  First month the internet speed was good. After  little by little in a few weeks  from 52 MBs  was going down to 2 MBs Was impossible to use internet. But They advice me upgrade package for a better speed!!! Also the bill was increased little by little and end up paying 5.65 pounds more. See your bills regularly  you may have a surprise ! I have give up BT.~~~,cf44 8ll~~~,2019-06-05~~~,1,1,1,1
During 18 month contract broadband speed disappeared almost every month for a whole weekend. Even contract said that speed should be 52 MBps  I never get more than 32 Mbps with a Green Box located 25 meters from the house. During contract time monthly Direct Debit fluctuated several time by increasing from 34 to 35  then back to 34  then it increases to 38. If it is fixed monthly Direct Debit. It should be fixid. But not with BT. When contract ends they switched you automatically to the highest price service  without properly informing you and offering something instead of your ending contract. They making changes to your Monthly direct debit without properly informing you about that.~~~,Bournemouth~~~,2019-06-02~~~,1,2,2,1

"Just switched from BT to Talk talk today and what a relief. I was initially promised a monthly bill of £27.99 a month for 18 months....and...since that ""promise"" my bill has steadily increased to £42.99 over that period for simply Internet (no TV package and I don't use a landlines phone). It's simply annoying as they cannot keep their word. When I phoned up today I was hard balled for about 15 minutes by a sales rep claiming they were much better than TakTalk and as a ""valued"" customer they would revert my bill back to £27.99 a month for  yes you guessed it.....the next 18 months. I actually laughed at her down the phone and said ""you promised me that last time and TakTalk are offering me the same speeds etc for £25 a month"". I was simply met with ""you will receive an inferior service"". Wow  desperate  unprofessional and simply rude. I will never return to BT as they are a dinosaur company  over charging loyal customers and using hard ball selling techniques best suited to time share agents of the 80s.....au revoiur BT.

"Many speed dips down to a few MB/s download. Use the BT app to check and miraculously they find it's fast.Switching to another supplier  BT told me ""they will be just as bad as we supply the infrastructure"".~~~",East Kent~~~,2019-05-21~~~,2,2,1,1
Have been with BT  for many years but will probably go else ware when my contract is up. There customer service is terrible and know one cares  When you take out you contract.~~~,Northumberland ~~~,2019-05-16~~~,3,1,4,3
Absolutely terrible  salesman misled me to believe I was getting something else for my deal  didn’t even process the order correctly which meant it had to be deleted and no one from BT told me. When I complained I was advised that for each problem I have to speak to each team and complain - connections  sales and billing. Absolute waste of time; they do not care about their customers just your money.~~~,Devon~~~,2019-05-14~~~,1,1,1,1
I couldn't get different registration numbers for my multiple complaints about speeds of 2mb download  which is a contract breach.They cannot provide better service where i live  in weston super mare town centre  300 meters away from the exchange. It's not like I have the cheapest service because i wanted to  but even that fails to stay within the contract guaranteed limits.I will go to citizens advice and ask if there is a way to cancel the contract without having to pay a fee.If anyone knows of what legal actions could be taken against them please share it.~~~,Weston super mare~~~,2019-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1
In Weston super mare  near town centre  300 meters from exchange and they could only provide 17mb download and 0.70 upload.I have to connect to 4g if i want to attach a picture to an email.I might as well send a pigeon with it  just stick to 4g or get broadband from any other company...even if they use BT infrastructure they can provide better speeds.Just unbelievable how they can be called ISP  i'm waiting for the day I can cancel without a fee more then I am waiting for my bank loan to end.~~~,Weston super mare~~~,2019-05-10~~~,1,1,1,1

BT is worth company in UK.I am not recommend anyone  this BT company is bully and robbery from customers. I did contract for my business with them I was make 1 contract with BT ( broadband and phone)together  when I made contract from the beginning  they didn't explain me for closing and cancel charge  now I was closing down my business  then i called them and explained them  that time they said me  you have to pay for cancellation fees for £183.15  i was accepted for this fees. I paid them £183.15 already on March 2019. Now they send me another Bill £475.64  So i called them  for what you send me another Bill  So they said this is Broadband cancel Bill. Can you believe this?? Now they said separate cancellation payment. who can pay for that amount £ 658.79??? Before i paid £183.15   I called and asked them for this is last payment final Bill or not?  they said this is final Bill for Cancellation.But  now they said this is another bill with different reason.when i find solicitor  i will Sue bt company~~~,london~~~,2019-05-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Speed's actually not bad.... but the service and the company is absolutely atrocious. Operators have lied to me  they fail to call you back  they fail to follow through with problems. BT have just employed a new chief exec and he doesn't even come from either a consumer or telecoms background. This company is BROKEN. One of their executive level complaints team admitted that they all knew the customer service was terrible and claimed that was the reason they bought EE... so that they could show them how to do customer service. How these people have a licence to operate I'll never know.~~~,Suffolk~~~,2019-05-02~~~,1,1,4,1
Disgraceful service. After it took 4 months to get set up my suoerfast fibre broadband runs at 39mps when it works. It's now been off for a week. Rang BT and the first two people I spoke to denied I had an account with them with one even asking me to double check that the hub said BT. Wow.The 3rd person said it was a fault inside so an engineer had to come out. This was the 5th time an engineer visited as as always they come 5 minutes before the end of their slot. He was their 5 minutes and said no it's an outside problem. So now I have to have another appointment with open reach. If you complain they don't ri g you back  nobody knows what they're talking about and they generally couldn't care less. Terrible customer service and even worse internet which is saying something~~~,England~~~,2019-05-01~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

I do not recommend BT they promised me a £39.99 however we have just been charged £121.75 so if want a guaranteed price every month don’t get a contract with BT. We have also been charged for a engineer to come out even though they said we wouldn’t have to because it wasn’t our fault the WiFi was broken it was the council so if you want a trustworthy broadband and a bill the same price every month don’t go with BT. There is not good customer service they never communicate to each other even though they work together. I’ve said this loads but it needs to be known that BT IS NOT A GOOD BROADBAND SERVICE  go with someone else.~~~,~~~,2019-04-27~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I agreed a broadband deal on line. They cancelled my phone and broadband with sky on my behalf. They sent me several emails stating a date when my router would arrive and the date when my broadband be started. The day came I set it all up and I had no phone or broadband. I waited up till midnight when they said it may take till. Still no broadband. The next day I went to work when I came home still no phone line or broadband. I phoned and after waiting for 15 minutes for them to answer the phone was told that there wasn’t a portal for them to connect us to so the order had been cancelled yet no one had contacted me. I was told that I would have to wait 24 hours then ring back again to re order. So I did just that to be told on this occasion that I could only have the copper connection and had to go on a waiting list for the fibre connection and there was no time frame. I had to wait for someone to cancel theirs and then take my place in the queue. Also that I could not have my google home as agreed on my previous deal as it wasn’t on this copper one. Maybe when I finally got onto the fibre they would see what they could do. I can’t believe that a big company like BT couldn’t still give me the gift as some sort of compensation for all the inconvenience That was caused by them. I am absolutely disgusted by them. Do not go with them their deals are a scam as they don’t know until the date of connection if there’s an available portal. All to late as your previous supplier will have been cancelled.~~~,Caister-on-Sea ~~~,2019-04-25~~~,1,1,1,1
What disgusting company they transfer you to operators 5 time before anyone can help when you constantly repeating yourself I had problems with my broadband for over a year every month was calling bt to fix it am paying for a service they can provide and they make up lies saying there's no information about the faults would waste my time and money I have cancel my broadband I will not be paying them anything there a SCAM please customers read the over review on here and trust them don't sign up to bt they will dragy for stress and you will be fighting with them every month to get your boredband right.~~~,birmingham~~~,2019-04-25~~~,1,1,1,2
"I've recently been experiencing a lot of problems with my so called BT ""Super Fast Fibre Optic Broadband"" speed (lots of buffering)  internet channels unavailable and with the Broadband dropping intermittently. We frequently can't find the Broadband to connect to even on devices which have been logged in constantly. When the phone rings or a landline call made  it disconnects the Broadband and has done so from the outset  the engineers have not provided a solution. As BT have a new Smart Hub 2 with Wifi Disc to sell  I have a suspicion they're messing around with our broadband to force us to ""upgrade"" to their new product  for which there would have been no need as apart from the Broadband dropping out when the phone rings  was fine  coverage in every room was not a problem until very recently. I smell a big BT rat.~~~",London~~~,2019-04-25~~~,2,4,2,1
Horrible service - on the phone they claimed I would not need to pay for an old contract if I get a new more expensive one. I specifically asked if upgrading meant paying for the old and the new contract and the rep said they would leave a note on my account for this conversation. Of course they sent a £200 bill for the old contract  on top of paying for their Superfast Fibre 2. When I called they said no note could be found on my account and I should wait for the charge to come through and speak with my bank about reversing the direct debit. After the direct debit came through the advice was I should have done something about it before it  and nothing could be done now.~~~,London~~~,2019-04-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Moved from SKY after 12 years  to BT  and said £29.99 month and free £70 loyalty card after 30 days. BT Delayed the Broadband 30 days as error at BT end so we had no Broadband for 30 days now 120 days later no Loyalty card and they say its not being sent now.Do not use BT they promise things to get you on board  and after you sign 18 month contract  they do not pay the rewards.Going back to SKY at contract end~~~,Coventry~~~,2019-04-17~~~,1,1,1,1

Don't know where to begin. Changed from TalkTalk to BT on the hope of internet in every room. Five weeks later  I have no internet. BT gave me a start date  sent the equipment  ended my previous supplier  and then left me stranded. We run a home business  requiring internet. This hasn't seemed to bother the countless BT staff we've contacted. They're all 'sorry'  and promise to resolve the issue  etc  but nothing gets done. It's a broken business.
