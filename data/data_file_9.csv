The worst experience I have ever had. I would look to use anybody but BT. If you enjoy 2 months of hell with a customer service team who are completely inept then this is the service for you. I have never come away from working with a company with such a passionate distaste for them. CHOOSE ANYBODY OTHER THAN BT~~~,LONDON~~~,2019-10-22~~~,1,1,1,1
"I have been trying to add ""complete wi-fi"" on to an existing package. This costs an extra £8 per month but would solve issues we have with thick walls. To sign up  our BT TV package will only last 18 months and BT broadband 24 months. This will mean a 6 month gap and pressure to sign up for another contract with BT. This is a risk that could be too costly. Very disappointing.~~~","Battle, East Sussex ~~~",2019-10-21~~~,2,2,4,4
I was approached by BT to sign up for another 18 months and that would involve me going on to BT plus. At the time my line throughput was 41Mbits/s. This speed remained constant for a couple of months and the it started to drop and eventually went down to 10 Mb/s. I rang BT and unfortunately had to speak to their Indian help desk. I had to remove all connections from my router and went through all the tests until the last test where I had to hang up. No call back on reply. I rang them again  a different agent. He insisted I go through the testing sequence again. Again I was told to hang up. Nothing again. At this point I gave up. A friend of mine who works for Openreach measured my line and said there was a high resistance fault probably on the pole outside. I rang BT and fortunately got a British operative who logged it as a fault and three days later an engineer came round and fixed the fault. All well and good I hear you say. No. The throughput speed came up to 25Mb/s. I had somebody ring me to see if I was satisfied. I said no. They decided to send me a new router. I installed this and this one had a software field that actually measured the line speed. It said it was running at 30Mb/s however testing with their own software and Ookla line speed tests it has now dropped to 20Mb/s. The router says it is running at 30Mb/s so what am I to conclude from this? It would appear to me that their network manage to system is throttling my line down to 20Mb/s. As a result of this and poor customer service I shall be voting with my feet at the end of the contract~~~,Canvey Island~~~,2019-10-19~~~,1,1,1,1
We have received help from Tyrone both yesterday and today. He was very devoted and exceeded our expectations. He fixed an internet issue that we have had for a very long time and went the extra mile as he came in extra early the next day and made sure the problem was fixed.

Worst broadband experience.  Broadband kept on cutting out  after multiple attempts 7 engineers  I finally managed to cancel my contract and get a full refund of charges.

After 6 weeks of trying to get internet installed  it’s pretty obvious BT have some huge internal system/process issues  I have experienced 4/5 times of having conversations / orders placed only to find out that the relevant email/sms does not reflect anything ‘booked’ on their systems.On top of that the complaints procedure is obviously a token gesture as it’s quickly closed followed by a experiencing exactly the same issue you complained about. Overall absolutely abysmal service.~~~,~~~,2019-10-06~~~,1,1,1,1
So  I've come home looking forward to watching Netflix after a long week  and my bt internet isn't working. I have tried the 'on off' method as you do and it doesn't work. I checked the status and apparently it's 'good' in my area. Been on the website and tried to test the landline number and the page goes to an error. It hasn't worked the whole day and when I try test the connection it goes straight to an error page. This is poor from a big company as they do not state any recommendations  fixes  or even acknowledgement of the issue. I hope it is fixed soon as I pay good money for the service.~~~,London~~~,2019-10-05~~~,2,1,1,1
Not been with them long but cancelled this morning absolutely rubbish service we have gone back to our original supplier . The straw that broke the camels back was no phone and no internet again this morning. Being pensioners nearly 80 years old we rely on our internet a lot. When we went with them we thought that they would come and set it up but you have to do it yourself so l had to get someone in to do it.~~~,Walsall ~~~,2019-10-01~~~,2,2,2,2

Had 12 months of serious broadband issues  now have issues with a mobile service too. Let me explain - I noticed broadband connection issues  called out their Openreach guys  fixed it so no problems right?  - Wrong!  lost connection 3 times more  engineer sent out  he hooked up terminal to my line box which displayed a different number  so he went out to check  returned to say my private line was unplugged (stolen) obviously previous engineers working etc - then told there's ample space for new lines etc - then fixed issue and made report back to BT.   BT sent the standard email eg:  case closed   then line got hijacked again - altogether lost about 2 months internet time  which after months of phone conversations was eventually credited to my account. Took out a 2nd service - a mobile phone contract approx £372 pa for I Phone SE (6 year old phone!!)  which was a 'recommendation' from 'Sales Dept' - sounded ok   biggest mistake I made --  phone battery issues galore   to a point where phone battery depleted from 8 hours a day (only switched on  and no other usage) to a mere 3 hours after a full recharge!   BT wouldn't take responsibility  tech support was refused  so got passed to Apple instead.   Problem was the battery  Apple sent just a refurbished replacement model  not brand new or a newer model offered. Moving on 7 months later - they double billed me due to 'automated billing system error' - which messed my finances up for 3 months  BT tried to stick me with an engineer call out fee of £180 - based on their customer service suggestion and insisted a broadband check be done at my end to help solve the slow speed issue.   Fault was found to be BT's and not damage to my equipment etc - so another credit made to my account - I should think so..... Forward a few months and I paid my mobile bill by credit slip at my bank.  BT sends me a reminder to restrict my service etc  I explained it was paid 20 days earlier  assured my service was restored  but I owed them £55 for 'other mobile services' which they couldn't explain what these extra's were - actually illegal as all charges must be billed in detail which this wasn't - I questioned this  requested in-depth details and promised to pay once proper itemised bill is forwarded - but none came  yet their still trying to bill me for a non existent extra that I know I never requested as my bill is just for the phone and is one charge only for unlimited calls. so nothing else to pay. They then sent me a further reminder  threatening account termination  along with debt collection action and that I would be stuck with extra fees for non-payment etc - a very aggressive letter indeed.   If only they checked their bank account to see the bank transfer  hmmmm.  So got proof of payment from my bank  agent reconnected my service  but few days later - BT disconnected me again for reasons unknown. Don't get me started on the nightmare call transfer system they force on their customers  or the rude agents intent on blasting policy instead of active listening skills that should be employed to understand the mere basic of info needed to sort an issue.~~~,London~~~,2019-09-13~~~,2,1,3,4
I don't understand why some people have such problems. I have been with BT for nearly 2 years and they are amazing. I use them for broadband and mobiles  and they are ALWAYS sss helpful.I am so pleased with their service I have extended my contract for another 18 months~~~,Leicestef~~~,2019-09-13~~~,5,5,5,5
I started with BT almost 3 years ago after moving to an address where Virgin Media was unavailable. I had no major problem getting started with BT with everything being as it should be regarding my phone  TV  Sport and Broadband 'package'. The contract was 12 months. There were no major problems in that first 12 months  however when coming to renew I had an email from BT before the contract expired offering me a Broadband renewal at a reasonable price but with a contract for 18 months not 12. I spoke to them via their helpline but was told 18 months was now their minimum contract period. I agreed to this.  A few weeks later they contacted me again about my TV and sport contract!!!!!! I thought I had just renewed this but it turns out the verbally agreed renewal was just for the Broadband BUT the TV and Sport package were now a minimum of 24 months. So  there is the major problem - how can I watch the final 6 months of my TV and Sport package if I decide not to renew my broadband? Sneaky. Having spoken with my wife we decided to go ahead with the TV and Sport as we had already committed to the Broadband.Fast Forward 21 months - suddenly realise that my monthly bill had shot up to £80 from around £40. I contact BT who tell me that I am out of contract with my Broadband and therefore have no 'deal' and the price has risen to £52 (a lot of money  especially as I can only get a maximum of 25mbps where I live via FTTC) I point out that BT did NOT contacted me regarding the end of my broadband deal but obtained no explanation or response from the BT 'assistant'. I enquired about reducing my cost of my existing 'plan' by cancelling the BT Sport and TV package that to be honest we don't watch much at all. In this day and age of Netflix  Youtube and other streaming TV services  BT's TV is not an attractive proposition. This is probably why they hike up the price of their broadband post contract to offset the lack of customers taking up their TV options. To cut a long story a little shorter  my BT 'assistant' could not offer me any sort of decent broadband deal so I am cancelling everything. My 'early termination' charges are way lower than remaining with BT so I'm off. Having placed an order with a different supplier for just Broadband and phone line  (NOT a BT subsidiary of EE or Plusnet) I am now receiving text messages from BT asking me to reconsider. To be fair to BT  I was never unhappy with the Broadband and had few drop-outs and would have remained with BT for many more years  however  due to their underhand sneaky price hiking and contracts of unequal length  designed to trap their customers  I will NEVER trust BT again. Deals can be agreed and negotiated but trust cannot. Goodbye BT  - Forever.~~~,Coventry~~~,2019-09-12~~~,3,2,4,4

Had tv and broadband package which came with £100 on a debit card and free bt sports. Tried to use the card which doesn’t work   can’t contact anyone!! Also had my monthly bill increased   I phoned to make a complaint and was told after a long discussion that my bill would not increase. Forward a month and my bill increased  called again to complain and was told the previous advisor should not have agreed that   made a complaint and was told they would look into the complaint . Just had a phone call and been told my bill will increase   I told the advisor you wouldn’t fill a car up with fuel and half way through the garage decides to increase the price by 10p a ltr. THIS IS LEGALISED ROBERY~~~,Derbyshire ~~~,2019-09-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Someone mentioned in the reviews about BT as big trouble  that says all about it and I agree. You will not get any notification about price rise  you will only come to know until you check your bank statement / a/c balance online. When you enquire about it you would be said that an email is been sent to you. Then you have to pay whatever extra charges as per terms and conditions. If you want to get out of those added packages(sports) you will need to pay extra as well.All this without the consent of the customer. I lost all my opportunity to opt out of the added package at the time of price rise with no e mail notification sent to me. Yes I get all other promo emails not the price rise email. Spend more than 1 hour over the customer services and the answer is terms and conditions. So no point in ringing and wasting time. If you can't find any other supplier only then you should even think about BIG TROUBLE. Good luck to all~~~,London~~~,2019-09-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
DO NOT TAKE THIS BROADBAND  customer service is useless a lot of lias  is not working at all even on Facebook you can't go ...they charging for nothing...at the phone to cancel your contract they are saying you have to pay £30 for one month and £47 the fee and after they are charging £145 ...they are not serious at all...really bad customer service and experience...I fell so bad because of them...they see people like me how doesn't speak English and they trading to rope them ...be careful~~~,Edgware ~~~,2019-09-02~~~,1,1,1,1

BT are dishonest and made us agree to an 18 month contract without telling us that it was 18 months. They hide this information in order to tie people in. Our tenancy was only 12 months so we had to pay a large cancellation fee(almost £200!). Their customer service are also difficult to deal with. I had no problem with the broadband itself  but it is dishonest to actively try to trick people into signing an 18 month contract  especially elderly or vulnerable people. A company which is not to be trusted.~~~,Dundee~~~,2019-08-30~~~,~~~,2,5,5
18 month contract with BT  first few months everything was ok  good speed and reliability  then things deteriorated rapidly. Speed dropped and is now half of what I was promised  connection drops out constantly. I have complained on several occasions and was advised to reset the router on a weekly basis  reset it once but then for some reason it wouldn't reset again.  I am now in the process of switching provider and am hoping for an improvement but one thing is for sure  I won't be returning to BT.~~~,Ashton under Lyne~~~,2019-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
I am so disappointed with BT  I had no broadband connection for a week I contacted them and this was resolved  however was told I won’t be charged for the times I had no broadband  however the bill came with full amount which I had to pay. I contacted them online and was told we are going to refund you and you will get an email within 3-4 hours. I waited all day no email came. Decided to contact them again today and was being tossed around different agents and for 50 minutes I got no help. Was patient bough to remain connected and waited for them but they wasted close to an hour of my time with no help at all. So this means am going to pay for the times I had no connection and it’s always very slow seems they also switch it off at night i don’t know. Am glad my contract is ending soon  so.~~~,Kettering ~~~,2019-08-29~~~,1,1,2,2
I went from EE to BT as you are supposed go be able to get fast fibre broadband in every room. Yes you can if you buy into extra discs for every room. £10 extra for each one per month. Rubbish coverage. Can't wait for my contract to finish. Don't do it.~~~,Bryn Port Talbot~~~,2019-08-26~~~,1,2,1,1

Why is it BT continually get it wrong. Very simple these shysters increased the price of my BT without my knowledge or consent. Spoke to them and they hung up. Spoke to them and they said we sent an email (didn't get as it was in spam) said your in contract and that's it.

Broadband went dow. Engineer appointment with a 5 hr window. Traveled 220ml  5hr round trip and waited. When no show contacted BT was told engineer was on his way. Again no show. Found out that engineer had phoned in sick that morning. It appears then the I was deliberately deceived ie I was lied to. 2 further deadlines set by BT for fixing the problem pass with still no broadband. No update and no contact from BT.

Absolutely abysmal service and threats for BT Have been with BT for may years was out of contract and looked around and found I was paying about twice as much with BT as I could get with other providers. Contacted BT and asked if they could give me a better deal which they said they could they offered a couple of pounds off not the £35 need to be competitive. Asked for a PAC code but due to technical problems they could not give one. This went on for a couple of weeks but eventual got my PAC code and left B. They did however finally offer me a deal which was £1.00 more expensive than the company I transferred to. But there was no way I was going to stay with them after the way I had been treated. Was sent a final bill which I paid and have now spent a further month receiving threatening emails from BT. Saying they would be sending round the bailiffs and destroying my credit rating if I did not pay. This despite me having raised a complaint with them. Absolutely abysmal service will never ever go back to them.~~~,Cornwall~~~,2019-08-07~~~,1,1,4,4
BT= BIG TROUBLEBT is the worst company I have met so far. I have been with BT since January and since the beginning  I have told to BT to make sure if they can provide the service they were offering because I would need it. They kept saying that absolutely they could provide me and guarantee me a specific speed. Well  since January I complained as they never ever provided me with that speed that they said they would and that I was paying for. I spent so many hours to try to help them in solving the problems and having engineerings in and out  for absolutely nothing! Plus  they kept saying they would call me and they would not. I normally do not write reviews but this I really had.  BT the worst ever in service  price  and communication.~~~,Maidstone~~~,2019-08-06~~~,1,1,1,1

There has been a major issue with our broadband we have been without Broadband since 19th July  tried to update to a BT Plus customer on the 22nd July to upgrade to fibre. 10 days later we still have no broadband and I have been told this morning that our upgrade order has not been accepted yet due being stuck in their system and wont be connected at the earliest on the 1st of August  when we might get our broadband connection back. BT blame their supplier - meanwhile we the customer have to suffer!! it seems incredible that in the modern world that we live why they cant sort this problem out! The BT Mini hub supplied as temporary fix is practically useless. I will definitely be looking elsewhere after this distressing and frustrating experience!!!~~~,Matfield~~~,2019-07-30~~~,1,1,1,1

loved BT from the first broadband I had.Then the cost sky rocketed and 8 times out of ten the speed was not what I was supposed to get.Sky have given to me the same speed and the cost has almost halvedWhen BT say they can guarantee super fast broadband surely lower speeds should be as good~~~,Cheadle~~~,2019-07-27~~~,3,2,1,5

Don't bother paying for anything more than their standard broadband. If you expect superfast fibre  don't hold your breath. My download speeds got slower and slower until I was getting between 2Mbps and 7Mbps and constantly got interrupted. I pay £50 per month for superfast fibre and it is an absolute waste of money. An engineer has already been out  it was not fixed  then a second engineer who didn't arrive and then a third appointment was made. I am moving on to another provider as enough is enough. What a waste of money and time.~~~,Ipswich~~~,2019-07-18~~~,1,1,1,1

I hadn't had broadband before and had heard that since BT controlled all the cabling that their service would be best. How wrong.To start with things looked good. An engineer turned up on day arranged and installed line.  He said there might be teething problems and to get in touch if so. I did .       I needed the link for my work and it is vital I have live connection when I broadcast.   The link kept dropping out. I raised query.  An engineer was arranged to come out (this took far more time and trouble than I can relay here).I realised I would be at a wedding and called help line to rearrange (again more time and faff than I can relay)  I was told that was sorted.  Then while away I was texted to say an engineer would call on the OLD date - would I be in or did I want to cancel (my only option in the circumstances was to cancel!)   then - as I suspected  no engineer turned up on new day. I had raised complaint and a complaints person rang me to  check out if line was now working.  This was exactly as I was communicating via the awful chat line system (see below) with another so callled 'helper' to try and establish if and when an engineer would call.    The complaints person said they'd ring back . The help line person asked if I wanted an engineer to call.  I explained that one was due to be visiting but emphasised YES PLEASE.    The operative terminated the on line call without sorting.  I now have a complaint on top of a complaint on top of a complaint - The service IS AWFUL.  Years ago I used to work in project management for Comms .     I can honestly say that service levels have gone down the pan and customer service is not fit for purpose.    Out-sourcing to a foreign country in a completely different time zone and in a completely diferent language  different culture  different etiquette  is a HUGE mistake.    No axe to grind with the individual helpline people on the other end: Its not their fault.  The model is wrong. The system is broken.   I am going to see about cancelling and going elsewhere.   Except i suspect more grief and heartache awaits en route.  This is no way  to live a life~~~,Gloucestershire UK~~~,2019-07-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely disgusting customer service. My dealings with BT have inspired me to cut all cables to my property  live in my shed and create some sort of nomadic existence for myself. On the plus side.. if you complain enough they will give you refund after refund. I’ve now got enough credit with BT to retire and move to the Bahamas if the shed gets a bit cold in the winter.

I read the reviews. It’ll be different for me I thought. Let’s try BT. What a mistake. Left Sky for BT business on Superfast Fibre.Day: 1 No phone or broadband connection. Call engineer to fix  sorted later that day.Day 2-4: No problems  great router.Day 5: BT inform us we are leaving them in 2 weeks but we can change our mind and stay.Day 6: BT terminate our service and give our telephone number back to Sky. Business now in turmoil - no receptionist  no online access. Numerous telephone calls to BT. Can’t find our number  join the complaints queue  no action being taken as we aren’t their customer any more. So much for the 2 year contract.Day 7: Give us our neighbour’s telephone number.Days 8-14: BT place 4 new orders  none of them right.Day 15: Today. We have our telephone number back but broadband now cut off.  We have lost £1000s in business over the last 2 weeks  not to mention face/reputation. I am absolutely livid with them.For God’s sake  for your sake  don’t go with BT  they aren’t fit for purpose.~~~,Reading~~~,2019-07-02~~~,1,1,4,3
Worst broad band and customer support. Have been receiving 2-5 mbps since last whole week and what bt have done so far is sent me rj11 cable as fix.  During there test they confirmed that the speed from bt box to my router is 69 mbps but from my router to pc 1-5 mbps through ethernet which they don't guarantee.  So they expect customer to sit on there router and suck the speed and transfer through telepathy because all there claims are just up to the router. And after that they dont give any guarantees that you will receive the same speed to your devices.  First they tried to exempt themselves by saying sir you might be using wifi which i wasn't then they oh our speed guarantee is up to the router.  On ther adverts of stay fast guarantees speed consistently but all there advergs are scam and full of lies.  On top of that when you ask them that you are 2 mb they ask for 7 months old email evidence that what you guaranteed speed. These guys are proper scammers who are only punctual in deducting there direct debit and when it comes to customer support all they donis restart your router and send you cheap cables and max 5 days worth of broken days credit.  Horrible post sales customer support.  Every year there is apain.. Last three months twice the services have crashed and they are busy in finding loopholes.  It's a simple effing transacrion. I will pay you money you provise me services. But they believe in making customer life a living hell. Lies excuses and loopholes. Thats what there belive is and ripping customer.  Go to any other provider exept bt. My honest opinion~~~,London~~~,2019-06-29~~~,1,1,1,1
