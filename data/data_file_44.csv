I went back to BT; over and over and over and over again.... after deciding to change my contract with another provider  BT (mis)sold me fibre broadband.  They enthusiastically (perhaps 'pushily') reiterated that is was 'Good news' as I have fibre broadband to my house.  They cancelled my contract with my previous provider and rang me two days later to tell me fibre was NOT available.  They then offered me a discounted copper broadband package  which I took only to find out that it would take a further two weeks beyond the original start date to install (a two week break in my service) and that it was significantly cheaper elsewhere.  I then cancelled my order to receive an order confirmation text message inviting me to reply 'start' to confirm my order?!? I rang customer services who told me that it should be obvious that an order confirmation means a cancellation (the word cancellation was never in the text).  The operative said that an order confirmation is 'semantically correct' for an order cancellation.  Not in my world. It is comical looking back  but the fact that the call centre operative would argue with a customer in such a way means that BT are not worth my money  any day  any time  ever.  After 8 separate phone calls to this lot I would say 'DON'T BoTher.'~~~,kent~~~,2016-09-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling service on broadband and tv. was told bt sport is free to view on the tv box. when I set it up its unavailable as my broadband speed is too slow. I have been mis-sold this product as it doesn't say anywhere bt sport depends on your broadband speed. when you phone up the call centre staff are rude and unhelpful  if they can even understand English. absolutely shocking service~~~,Manchester~~~,2016-09-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. The connection is very very slow and constantly disconnects at random times when very important events are being carried out. This also happened at my last house when i had bt where it would constantly disconnect and i would have to restart the connection over and over and over untill my brain couldn't handle it anymore. The wifi is constantly slow and drives the whole family insane. Arguments and fights have arised from this dark connection that caused a violent plague to erupt in my household. Sometimes in the morning when i go to eat and McDonalds i take my PC there with me in order to recieve a taste of stable connection. Signing with  BT was a fatal mistake that will daunt me till the day i die and I truly hope no one will have to face such a horrific experience.~~~,london~~~,2016-09-28~~~,1,4,1,1
Recently I had a problem with my home land-line having a loud crackle and also broadband which kept disconnectingThe customer service from BT was appalling. Problem with their oversees call centres not able to understand me and vice versaThey told me twice that my fault was fixed  when it wasn't and had to start the process all over againI have now given up on BT~~~,North East~~~,2016-09-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Having suffered several 'major outages' in this area over the summer  I made a complaint to BT. A few days later they called me back - to see if they could call me back in a few days time! By the time they eventually called me to discuss my complaint  we had had another 'major outage'. The customer service gentleman I spoke to had an Indian accent  but I wouldn't say I couldn't tell what he was saying. Mostly he blamed Openreach for the problem  but that is surely a cop out. If he was calling to deal with my complaint  surely that means that whatever arm of BT he worked for was taking responsibility for it. He also seemed to contradict himself over and again. First telling me he could give me a rebate on rental for the number of days outage  then saying he could not unless it was 5 consecutive days outage - which we had not had.  I tried to clarify what he was saying  getting very frustrated that he seemed to keep contradicting himself. At the end of the conversation I told him I thought it very poor service that we had to be without internet for 5 consecutive days and that I would look for another service provider. We agreed though that he could close the complaint as we seemed to be going round in circles and he said he would make the rebate!!! I don't know if we are getting a rebate or not. I was left feeling very confused and frustrated - so much for customer service. He did however confirm that we are not under any current contract with BT so I told him I would be looking elsewhere for an internet provider who knows what customer servce means.~~~,Chester~~~,2016-09-28~~~,1,2,3,3
Absolutely useless!!!!!! Took 6 weeks to activate. What a joke!! Internet speed not as fast as they guaranteed it would be and customer services couldnt give a flying monkey about there customers~~~,~~~,2016-09-27~~~,~~~,~~~,3,2
Awful awful  only joined because of sky 12 month deal oh dear   I live 300 yards from exchange  broadband will drop out at any time 3am 5.30 am 10.00pm I cannot tell enough people how poor they are  truly deceitful company  anyone reading this  don't go to BT  awful service awful customer care  laboured call times  truly awful~~~,Banbury~~~,2016-09-27~~~,2,1,1,1
Every evening (around 7pm) speed drops from around 24Mbps to less than 5Mbps. Often less than 1Mbps. Usually back up to decent speed by 12am. Nothing different that I am doing so must be down to BT. As I work during the day  the evening is when I need the speed!~~~,Wrexham~~~,2016-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Opted for fibre optic given long distance from Exchange but pretty diabolical all round Pros:Netflix works well (only tried in evening) Cons:- Consistent connectivity problems during the day (off peak!)- Poor quality VoiP calls (mainly Skype)- Incredibly poor support  helpline performs speed test and that is their key to connection being ok- Any further support must be through their paid for service~~~,"Chiswick/Acton, London~~~",2016-09-27~~~,2,1,3,1
Have been with BT since July !!we have infinity which keeps dropping out wish i had stayed with Sky!!! will be gooing back after 12 months is up. Have tryed contacting customer services  over a hour waiting in a que they are a joke.~~~,Devon~~~,2016-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I have never come across such bad & unprofessional customer service.Ive spent hours on the phone trying to get my email address changed.I have been passed from department to the other .The English team are great the team of advisors abroad in India or where ever are diabolical.I wouldn't have anything to do with BT ever .avoid like the plague at all costs .~~~,leeds~~~,2016-09-27~~~,1,1,2,1
"I have what BT jokingly refer to as high speed fibre broadband.  I live less than 3/4 mile from one of the most modern exchanges in the north west so theory is a good short run connection.the funny thing is when we made an upgrade 3 years ago the engineer had a problem locating the distribution box. this was eventually located about a mile in the opposite direction. This is probably why the service is so abysmal as we may have (some doubt about that) the fibre optic to the box but then we have about a mile or so of Victorian copper cable thereon. Says it all for BT promises of better performance. Disgusted for £50.0 a month. As they say in Dragons den ""Im out""!~~~",Oswestry Shropshire~~~,2016-09-26~~~,2,2,1,2
Don't use BT  seriously. I've had the worst experience with BT  and although the advisors have been semi-useful  it's not good enough to compensate for the terrible service. To validate my claim: I'm a student  this means that I need internet  particularly a reliable connection. I move into a new flat and ring BT and ask how long they'll take to get my internet working. I'm quoted 10-12 days. Fine  that's average  I can go that long on data  just. They check my postcode  confirm this and let me know that I can get at least 50mb in my area. I buy a BT Infinity 1 package. Super.  I get an email confirming that the hub will be delivered (c.£8) and the line will be switched (c.£49) in 11/12 days. Two hours later  I get another email saying that actually  it's going to be 21 days(!). The advisor suggests BT Openzone but there isn't one nearby  so they suggest that I get a MiFi data box for the time.  I buy a MiFi data box for £14.99 and buy 32gb data (there are 3 people in my household and this need to last 3 weeks) for £25. That's now another £40.  Finally  the hub arrives and the internet is turned on. Great. The literature that came with it says that it would take 3 days to settle  okay. After 4/5 days of terrible connection that drops out frequently and doesn't exceed 20mb (averaging at only 9.4mb) BT rings me because I put in a complaint about the wait. I explain how bad the internet is and the advisor tells me that it will take a week to settle.  I ask her about the 21 day wait  she says that I'm entitled to £14 compensation  but when pushed she offers me £20.  At this point  I've received my first bill and with all the charges it's over £80 and that's just my BT bill  it doesn't include the data I had to buy which pushes it to over £120.  Now I'm sat here a week later  a student  with a bill of £108 (minus the discount which hasn't actually been taken off yet) because of BT  after having to wait 21 days for connection. Oh  and to add insult to injury  my internet hasn't connected for the past half hour  even with resetting the hub twice. I'm writing this on Word ready to copy and paste if it does come on again  or for when I get into Uni-whichever comes first.  Don't bother with BT  if it's in your area  go with PLUSNET instead  faster/matched speeds  cheaper  and more reliable  it's what my friend has in her student house and what my parents use at home and they've had no problems. Update: My bill is due tomorrow before posting this review I thought I'd give BT one more chance. I spent 40 mins waiting on the phone. 30 mins waiting on a live chat  then later another 50 mins on live chat just for it to disconnect after I had told my problems to the operator. Useless.~~~,Canterbury~~~,2016-09-26~~~,1,1,1,1
OMG! never use BT for broadband  i have faulty equipment and all i get is renew your contract and we will replace  i bought the 'smart hub' from there shop and after speaking to a dozen different indian call centre operatives i and loosing the will to live  BT you are rubbish!~~~,cornwall~~~,2016-09-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Appalling  I wished I had never sighned up to them   since august1st I've had 2 ghost engineers appeared and 2 line rental engineers appeared to fix a broadband problem . I have wasted around 70joits of my life on hold or in a quie . they are totally useless as a provider . You never get put through to the right department  and even complaints advisers could not give a damn . My next step is to cancel my subscription and wait for them to phone me . They might just talk to me then when they don't get my money .. I cannot stress enough that it's the most frustrating company I've ever felt with .~~~,Ballymena ~~~,2016-09-26~~~,1,1,1,1
the worst company in the world to deal with had no broadband for 2 weeks now keep being told its being sorted then the date moves.non existant customer service why cant tey just send an engineer out like the old days and bedone wth it  corporate greed is all it is.ive cancelled my direct debit see you in court~~~,west midlands~~~,2016-09-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

What a shambles BT are I joined them early May 2016 to start with they had to set up 4 different set ups with me spending up to 10hrs on the phone speaking with what can only be imbeciles incapable of doing a job. 4weeks later I find they had set me up on direct debit 2 accounts after numerous phone calls I eventually got someone to see some sense. I set up my broadband on unlimited only for BT to keep emailing me costs of going over my as they say 25 meg which drove me mad. Now after all that my BT sport and sky sport I pay extra for has gone down completely after 1hr trying to talk to customer service and waiting one and a half hrs to speak with technical services which I never got through to I'm completely at my tether with this company so please please think twice otherwise unlike me spending the best part of 15 hrs on the phone you will go completely insane!!!!!!!!~~~,Tameside~~~,2016-09-25~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Been with the company about a month already had to make 2 complaints both completely ignored. DO NOT go with BT you will regret it. I'm saving up so I can leave asap.~~~,Portsmouth~~~,2016-09-25~~~,1,1,1,1
"Just paid for an ""upgrade"" which keeps dropping out. The customer care is the worst I have ever experienced  in any industry. The Outlook engineers have about 2 weeks experience each and are useless  literally. Even the BT engineers  who generally know what they are doing  cant stand them. This dreadful company is a shameful example of what happens when there is no effective oversight. The fatboys at the top cream off huge salaries for no reason and no one gives a damn about the company. The board of directors should be savked for incompetency and the customer care should be brought back to the UK. I have nothing in principle against Indian call centres but the ones BT uses are utterly  utterly incompetent. Probably selected for cheapness alone. What a truly dreadful  shameful company.~~~",Reigate~~~,2016-09-24~~~,1,1,3,1
Installation puzzling end up installed where i do not want it. Was then told to install upstairs will cost me £120 / customer care rang twice both times I was cut off. Cannot access my account easy I have given up. Do not reccomend BT I have a 12 month contract whech I will finish as soon as I can. I advise anybody not to buy BT internet.~~~,bramhall~~~,2016-09-24~~~,1,1,3,2
Total rubbish  only since refusing BT Infinity due to costs involved speed is ridiculously slow~~~,Swindon~~~,2016-09-22~~~,1,1,1,1
BT service is very good  however they try to get you to sign up with vouchers for £100 and £50 which they do not honor.  Don't know how they get away with this deception.~~~,BARROW-IN-FURNESS~~~,2016-09-21~~~,1,1,5,5
I was having some issues connecting my laptop to the new home hub we had just received. Although the problem could not be resolved (due to the age of my laptop)  the customer service was quick and helpful in trying to determine the problem and figure it out.~~~,England~~~,2016-09-21~~~,3,5,4,3
they alter monthly payments without your consent so you wind up in debt 12 month contracts wind up as 9 month contracts without warning and I don't mean price changes when your with another isp and you have a speed fault like no usable service and you inform your isp they the report it to bt they in return say there is no fault after putting up with no internet for 3 months I phoned bt only to get the answer your not our customer so ok I cancelled my existing contract with my isp and joined BT broadband with a promise of 1.5mbs but when I connected up over three days of use the only speed I was getting was .001 mbs if I was lucky so there was a fault and my former isp lost a contract because of bt cheat also the speed that I now get is so say 5.8 mbs and yet if I connect more than one laptop or desktop the surfing use or bbc iplayer is trashed they then offer you infinity so you say ok then when you check the download speed from their cabinet the one you will bb connected to you find that the min speed is just bellow what your getting anyway I could write a book about the dirty tricks that BT use the sooner the government and local councils wake up to the useless service and con that BTopenreach are pulling with the grant money being paid to them to provide a superfast highway to the most populous users this area for one is not getting it their excuse is the copper wires my answer is what happened to the 21st century cabling promised by bt this was supposed to be completed years ago if we are on second rate cabling that provides a second rate service why are we paying a top rate monthly price for a second rate line that can't take the load. Ofcom should wake up to the ripoffs this company is pulling I could write a book of all the cons they have tried on me but the best is the councils and government are wasting tax payers money~~~,wiltshire~~~,2016-09-21~~~,1,1,1,1

Probably the worst internet service you could go with  constant low speeds  absolutley terrible customer service who half the time dont even know what they're talkig about although you just waited 3 hours to talk to them  discusting reliability hardly ever works to its full potential download speeds are terrible and you can expenct regular lag and slow speeds  STAY AWAY!!!~~~,London~~~,2016-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst service I have ever experience in my life! Paying for fiber optics. it should be around 35mb upload speed. I am getting 4mb at best. I have tried calling BT every day but after being on hold for over an hour and not getting through I give up. I work from home and am losing work and money from this situation!~~~,sussex~~~,2016-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
absolutely disgusting customer service  pushed from pillar to post  I have spoken with 6 different advisers today and only 1 could tell me the truth! that my order has somehow slipped through the net  after spending over an hour on the phone 3 weeks ago placing an order for tv and broadband and giving my card details  and to be told I have an engineer coming out. My appointment was meant to be tomorrow but I have had no communication from bt in the past 3 weeks so i thought id better call them to check as I would need to take time off work! after 1 30 minute live chat and 5 half an hour to an hour calls later they told me that there is no order for my address/name/contact details. Disgusting customer service  I was cut off 3 times and promised ring back numerous times which never materialized. I just cannot understand how a substantial order with a massive company like BT could go so wrong  highly dissapointed to say the least!~~~,Deeside~~~,2016-09-20~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Worst internet company that I have been with ever in my whole entire life. Crap wifi  even with fibre.... Increased my direct debit amount without informing me.. Crap customer service who kept offering me more offers rather than solving my issues on the online chat (and he didn't seem to understand my questions). Will be leaving when I have used up my data for the month that I had paid so much for !!! It's like daylight robbery! GO WITH A DIFFERENT COMPANY!~~~,Norfolk~~~,2016-09-20~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"Worst customer service/incompetent staff.. unreliable internet despite paying the most expensive package! Also  increases the cost of your monthly direct debit without informing you as ""your contract ended""... Even without a notice prior to ending to remind me about it. Other companies I have been with would send reminder or continue with the package u signed up for. But instead   is ""ok"" and acceptable to charge u double of the cost you had initially agreed to!! It's like fraud! Moreover  the line keeps getting cut off especially at night. Not sure what you have been upgrading in your company!! Never with bt again. My whole family is leaving too! Generally an UNETHICAL company!~~~",England ~~~,2016-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely dreadful. 0.44MB download speed! 0.22 upload? Our experience with BT has been uniformly poor. Never again. I am happy to walk away from our contract if I could be sure of finding a better supplier~~~,"Newmarket, Suffolk~~~",2016-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
"The broadband we get is very good. BT customer service however is beyond poor. Issue started when I couldn't access BT sport through the app. Was told I had to ""refresh"" my package to reactivate. Told I would receive an email through later that day stating I had taken out a new contract by to ignore it. I did. No prizes for guessing that they had extended my contract without permission.  I have since had 7 calls with BT going round in an infuriating circle. Agreed new package  didn't put in place. When did charged me a sport cancellation fee when I was out of contract. On hold for 40 mins then cutting off (twice). Indian call centre with translation issues.  Eventually sorted the new contract only because they gave me 50% off & because the infinity broadband is God - otherwise would have gone elsewhere for sure. Couldn't possibly recommend the company based on these awful levels of customer service.~~~",Rochdale~~~,2016-09-19~~~,1,1,5,4
"If I could have given less than one star for reliability and overall satisfaction I would have. Truly appalling broadband with signal drop several times a day  this was over a period of nine months despite numerous calls to customer service who claimed to have ""identified and fixed"" the problem. If it doesn't get sorted this time  I'm going to Trading Standards.~~~",Preston ~~~,2016-09-19~~~,1,2,4,1
Recently switched to BT broadband  and I have been totally SHOCKED by how apalling the whole  experience has been. Mistakes in connecting the service  a router that doesn't work properly and terrible download and upload speeds at times when the  ridiculous BT sport- which I do not want and do not subscribe to- is at peAk time for entertaining people in pubs who are sensible enough not to subscribe to BT at home.... For me  BT epitomises the worst of the UK- a post-colonial monopoly that thinks it is competitive because it is a private company. With such an appalling service  it would not survive in a truly commercial market like the US. A total farce  and one star is one too may in each category. I should have trusted my instinct and avoided BT like the plague instead of falling for the marketing hype.~~~,Canterbury~~~,2016-09-17~~~,1,1,1,1
I personally begrudge putting even 1 star  this company has as many holes in its reliability as Swiss cheese the complete incompetence of its staff to communicate between themselves leaves you talking to a different person about the same problem repeatedly  from the beginning . in my case every week for nearly four month. a two day fix is not justification for closing a complaint  which then has to be reported again. basically this company has got to big to greedy and basically couldn't give a £^%$ about its customers.~~~,norfolk~~~,2016-09-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband speed is incredibly slow (1.7) and I would love to speak to BT about it but I don't want to waste another 2 hours of my life to try and get them to answer my call!  I would love to switch but started our 12 mth contract with them 2 mths ago.  Can we get out of a contract that obviously does not work for us?~~~,Lower Broadheath~~~,2016-09-15~~~,1,1,1,1
60 min wait to speak to their Indian Call Centre resulted in an engineer being booked to assess tv reception fault.Advised I would be charged £130 if the fault was within the home. No engineer arrived in the 5 hour time slot. No explaination and a further 60 mins on hold trying to re contact the TV support line. This service is truly shocking. Best avoid BT.~~~,Derby~~~,2016-09-15~~~,1,1,2,1
