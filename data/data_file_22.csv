BT Infinity is a waste of time  energy and money. They are incapable of delivering on their own contract terms. Dismissive  rude and obnoxious customer service when trying to complain and escalate unresolved issues. Stay well away if you actually want any kind of decent service.~~~,London~~~,2018-03-14~~~,1,1,1,1
"As my current BT broadband/calls package is costing £37.99pm  I checked on BT website to find that ""new customers"" can get the package for £24.99. So I used the online chat - after a very long wait for an adviser - to ask if I could get a cheaper deal (or quit BT!). Eventually was rung and passed over to a sales adviser to whom I complained I felt I was paying too much and what better deal could he offer. He first offered a contract which was only £6 cheaper  then when I prevaricated he offered a 2 yr contract at £29pm - but only if I placed the order there and then (altho I would have 14 days to cancel on receipt of their confirming email). It was stated that if I didn't take the deal today  there was no guarantee it would be available on a subsequent enquiry!! Needless to say  I told him I was going to explore a different provider  and I hung up!! Bully boy tactics I will not abide.~~~",Midsomer Norton~~~,2018-03-14~~~,3,2,4,4
Oh...dear...a month ago my internet went offline. Engineer came out then it took a week to fix. A month later its down again. Call for engineer first meeting missed  arrange another  that was also missed too! Called to find out whats going on only to find put problem with exchange and ports...not acceptable. Its still down now and has been now for 2 weeks out of a month and keep blaming the ports and the exchange like they think we wont know wjat they mean when im involved in IT. They dont know what the problem is and the service is poor. I will not recommend bt to anyone. Avoid.~~~,Liverpool~~~,2018-03-12~~~,1,1,3,2
As existing BT customer just attempted to upgrade from copper to fibre (Infinity) Broadband.  As usual with BT this has worked OK technically  but horrendously / comically badly in terms of dealing with BT admin.  Started with an appalling website  very difficult (for a very frequent  online user) to determine current package and costs;  rip-off prices for loyal customers (new customer deals for £25/ month are £50/month for existing!); after two phone calls agreed a better price  but order confirmation entirely wrong (standard prices); two phone calls  one formal complaint and a month and not sorted out the pricing.  BT = B??? Terrible!~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2018-03-12~~~,2,1,4,4
Broadband speed is quite variable and the wifi signal often drops out.~~~,North Somerset~~~,2018-03-12~~~,3,4,3,3
BT Broadband is by far the worst service I have ever had. Thier speeds fluctuate from 2mbps to 50mbps constantly and very often disconnects you completely. After 5 days of no internet and numerous tests We had a new hub which they charged us £50 for and still nothing. When an engineer arrived he found we had been disconnected from the green box in the street. No apology no compensation. It's a disgrace.~~~,Wirral~~~,2018-03-11~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Moved the house 5 weeks ago and still got no service.Been pushed from pillar to the post.Very poor customer services spent hours on the phone.Been promised connection few times and there we are 5 weeks later still no internet no tv and no telephone.No goodwill gesture NOTHING.Thats how you get treated after being loyal customer for over 5 years.Another phone call today stating that the service that ment to be starting in 2 weeks was cancelled again.And all they had to say is sorry.Very poor customer service~~~,Milton Keynes ~~~,2018-03-11~~~,1,1,1,1
very bad at everything  never tell you the truth. nobody helps with your problem. THEY ALWAYS OVER CHARE  SO IF YOU CHECK YOUR BILL THEY WILL KEEP ON OVER CHARGING. WE WILL NEVER RECOMMEND.~~~,UXBRIDGE~~~,2018-03-10~~~,1,1,1,1
I foned on the 8th March   afternoon  I had a BT guy at my door by 845 the next morning in Dunoon. The man was very friendly and explained things very well and resolved my problem and  I felt that he did his job very well. All I know is he has jinger hair and works in dunoon. Great asset to your company.~~~,DUNOON~~~,2018-03-10~~~,5,5,5,5
I was recommended BT after ringing a company that would stop my contract with Virgin Media and set up a new contract with BT in my new area (VM doesn’t provide its services in Old Colwyn otherwise I’d have stayed with them) and I have never been so disappointment in my 5 years of living alone. I got told that my tv box and internet hub would be delivered on the 08/01/2018 which it was. And the engineer would be coming out on the morning of 09/01/2018 to install and set everything up for us. On the 09/01/2018 everything was also meant to go live(which it didn’t!!). No engineer turned up but when I opened the boxes  I found instructions that I was to set it all up myself. So I did and nothing. Rang BT to be spoken to like dirt and laughed at because I wasn’t sure if I had done it right. The woman hung up on me so my husband called back the next day as nothin was working still. The kind gentleman apologised and told us that he couldn’t get an engineer out until the following week. Following Tuesday  a young man came out and set it all up for me and left without seeing if it was working(which it was not) so another phone call to BT and they wanted me to wait a further two weeks for another engineer. I told them that was fine but I wasn’t paying for my services for the time I didn’t have them. The guy started shouting at me down the phone and hung up on me  AGAIN!! Two weeks  & several phone calls later  someone came out to my house and told me that the box didn’t work and he get them to send out another. 10 days later that turned up and I still wasn’t receiving the services. By this time I’d lost count of how many hours myself and my husband had spent on the phone to BT and they agreed to take money off my bill. SIX POUND was all they could take off my bill when 5/6 weeks into having the contract I had no services. I fought until I was blue in the face and eventually they let the bill go. I told them I wanted to leave BT & they told me it was £700 to cancel with them bc I was past the time line. BY ONE DAY!! They are bullies and their customer service is disgusting. Eventually they agreed I could come out of the contract after I threatened to take them to trading standards!! AVOID JOINING BT AT ALL COSTS. I’ve had to keep my internet contract with BT and I don’t haven’t had a problem since I was guided over the phone how to fix this. But I still wouldn’t recommend.~~~,Old Colwyn~~~,2018-03-09~~~,1,1,3,3
Absolutely the worst customer services I have ever encountered! Three appointments now moved to have install and one was given to someone else when my wife waited in from 8am until 6pm for a 8am to 1pm appointment. New date confirmed and then a call to reschedule further down the line again. No one interested in sorting after explaining the issue to three different people in different departments! Dread to think what it would be like when you eventually receive the services!~~~,Chester Le Street~~~,2018-03-09~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
What a great person to have working for your company! Darren Williamson was so Polite and very helpful. After 6 months of waiting to be connected back he came and said that some has took our phone line- why the last couple of people couldn’t work that out I don’t know. Thanks Darren your the best.~~~,Brightwell-cum-sotwell~~~,2018-03-09~~~,5,5,5,5
Not worth rating bt the customer service is a lie they are not willing to help it's all about the money always check your bill they will charge you for things you have not got they were charging me £75 on top of my bill which when ever I rang them they were calling it a business where as it's a private family owned terrace. I am allready Ill and I did not need this rubbish of theirs extra money for nothing. With all honesty I do not recommend BT to anyone I have been with them for over 20yrs and they do not respect that all they want is money for free I would only recommend Virgin for good service which I have heard about and the Internet will not cut off..  BT broadband is not reliable and is slow that's my experience with them.~~~,Bradford~~~,2018-03-08~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Our BT broadband is so slow as to be useless for anything other than email. I have reported the fault again  but they insist there is nothing wrong with our 0.5mB download speed.~~~,Warminster~~~,2018-03-08~~~,1,3,1,1
I've never received worst customer service in my life than with this company. Went onto the live chat as I was charged quite considerably more than what I should've been for my bill. So after just under an hour of speaking to 'aditya' male or female who knows? She said let me speak to my supervisor... a few minutes after receiving that message  he/she left the chat. Leaving my problem unsolved and I didn't receive a phone call or email or anything in response. He/she was quite happy to just leave it at that. Undoubtedly the WORST 'customer service' I've ever received. The broadband speed is good ill give them that but apart from that I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone unless you want to be ripped off monthly and be treat appallingly. Disgraceful.~~~,Sunderland~~~,2018-03-08~~~,1,1,4,2
DO NOT trust BTDO NOT try to place your broadband order using their website (they will cancel it and force you to phone them)DO NOT phone BT without recording your callDO NOT finish your conversation without understanding every single word they say (foreigners  they will trick you)DO NOT expect they sign you up for the contract you asked forDO NOT think they won't lie to you in order to get more moneyDO NOT believe they will cancel your contract easilyDO NOT hang up the phone without getting a confirmation email from BT of what you agreed~~~,~~~,2018-03-08~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Awful customer service  I've been trying to resolve an issue for the last 8 months since I moved into a new property but it has been my worst nightmare! Stay away  this company doesn't give a damn about you as a customer  they will just milk you!~~~,London~~~,2018-03-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Is this the worst most heinous bullying company in the UK? Hike their prices up whenever they feel like it and when you exercise your right to leave they try to bully and threaten you with all sorts. This is the second time (yes  how stupid am I) I have been with BT and I left them early last time because they upped their prices mid term. Chasing a fe £ that time cost lost them £100s  now the same thing has happened again. To be fair to BT I know people who simply pay the increase and are happy paying through the nose so I guess overall the awful business model of ripping people off does work for them. However BT will never ever get my direct custom again.~~~,Isle of Wight~~~,2018-03-07~~~,1,1,5,5
Avoid at all cost. Worst company ever. Didn't keep appointment and no-one contacted me to explain why. Customer service is abysmal. Have made a complaint but they still don't keep me up to date. Nobody tells you anything  just a load of lies and fobbed off.I hve no idea what the problem is and why it is taking so long to have my broadband conected. Will be looking for a new provider and cancelling my order.~~~,BRISTOL~~~,2018-03-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Worked fine until 2 months ago. Now it drops connection randomly. Bt help desk are worse than useless and are unable to answer why or even fix it. Speed is decent IF you can keep a reliable connection. An ISP I would not recommend anyone take up. Also as a point of note  had my net go down for 5 days with no support from BT. Not the service I expected and definitely a service I am leaving~~~,London~~~,2018-03-05~~~,1,1,3,1
I have been waiting for BT to connect our broadband for 4 weeks. They have had to cancel the original order and create a new one today meaning we will be without internet for another 3 weeks. They claim we can use their BT wifi network but their own website shows it is not available on our road. Terrible service. Offered no help. We paid £59 set up fee which was more than other providers. Would not recommend~~~,Bristol~~~,2018-03-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Worse then dreadful Some 40 years of good BT digital service gone in a puff of supposedly high speed broadband . But haven’t a clue on performance and service . My broadband has not worked properly since I took it up 4 months ago . They tell me it’s my iMac that’s faulty so I arrange to take in to Apple Then I think it’s my iPad that’s gone wrong so I buy new iPad . There nothing wrong with Apple it’s bt How I would like to cancel my contract .~~~,Ayr~~~,2018-03-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Completely and utterly useless.They don't turn up  they give no reason and won't even call back to offer a new appointment. But they're happy to add services to you bill that you haven't asked for. Avoid at all costs.~~~,Suffolk~~~,2018-03-03~~~,1,1,1,1

Hi everyone !     Me and my fiance are with Bt since Jun 2013. We lived in LLandudno for 3 5 years and we had network disconations and speed internet problems. My fiance alredy spend on phone over 50 hours talking to Bt staff.     Now we live in Colwyn Bay and you can gues it is the same crap and again useless phone talks with BT staff.

It is my nightmare becouse i loooovee playing mmorpg and i need strong conetion. I really want to cry.     I am absolutly unhappy with BT it is an expansive nightmare.

Got told our bt box was getting delivered never came the day after an engineer was ment to be coming out never came didn't even get a phone call to let us know rang up again and said they would call us the following day but didn't so we rang them to find that apparently the order has failed twice but every time we rang they kept telling something different!! Absolute joke!!~~~,York~~~,2018-02-28~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is overpriced and Customer Service is rather arrogant.  They do brag constantly how well they are whereas they cant even keep up the internet speed as promised despite of many repairs and support.  I understand this may not be the case for many but still the arrogance is a real put off by the Customer Service in general.~~~,London~~~,2018-02-28~~~,1,1,2,2
54mbps on a guaranteed 100mbps minimum line.  I was told 80 down and 20 up were my minimums  I get 54 down and 8 up.~~~,Derby~~~,2018-02-28~~~,1,3,1,3
I’m moving house soon and these fools can’t even keep my internet working. “Their system has shut them out” but of useless morons at part from one chap I spoke to who was nice and helpful. I would go to any other internet provider instead.~~~,England~~~,2018-02-27~~~,1,5,1,1
Constantly crashes and isn't even close to the speed you pay for with the worst customer service imaginable. Steer clear  they are useless.~~~,Scotland~~~,2018-02-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Trying to upgrade to Ultrafast - got an email saying it's available  try to buy and website says it's not.  Speak to customer services  apparently their 'old system' knows its available . hence the email  but the 'new system' doesn't  so they can't sell it to me.  So they say they will fix that and place the order for me  even give me an order number.  Long and tedious story cut short  that order had never been placed  raised complaints  spoke to every man and his dog in India multiple times  still not fixed.  Utter shambles.~~~,Nantwich~~~,2018-02-24~~~,1,1,3,5
We moved house 2 weeks ago  was meant to have an engineer come out Monday and no one showed. Partner rang and was told we would get a call Tuesday  still nothing. I rang on Wednesday and after speaking to numerous people I was put through to Josh. He sorted us out  used his common sense and a new broadband box was sent out the next day  which I set up. (An engineer was never needed.) brilliant customer service from Josh.~~~,~~~,2018-02-23~~~,3,5,4,4
We’re towards the end of a line in a semi rural location with very old wiring.  Speed and reliability is poor  service is poor and cost is high as we pay for high speed in order to get best speed at box before it starts to deteriorate over the distance. BT have no interest in improving the situation and other providers do want to take it on or “network is not released to them”~~~,Longdown~~~,2018-02-21~~~,2,1,1,1
Shocking service  claim to be unable to get openreach to return and install service correctly as broadband and phone work. However fail to grasp that open reach have run cables all over neighbours property. Installed on the 15/02/18 I cancelled morning of the 16/02 as BT kept saying there was nothing they could do. I’ve now had to go to another provider and hope all goes well but have lost my phone number which I’ve Had for over 20yrs  have no broadband for over a month as I can’t have time off work for another month to be there for another installation and have one very unhappy neighbour to boot. All I kept getting was sorry  sorry doesn’t put this right. A simple call to openreach from BT was all that was required but no it’s all too much trouble.~~~,Oldham~~~,2018-02-21~~~,1,1,1,1

When it works everything id good   when it does not you are in a sue for a call centre in India. SHOCKINGLY poor customer service. Very nice & friendly but totally ineffective. To solve issues with Mac network connecting to BT home hub I ended up calling apple (sorted) - BT hopeless~~~,High Wycombe~~~,2018-02-20~~~,2,1,5,4
Honestly. It's been a year of absolute hell with BT. Guys; do not bother. Most people I know are now with sky and I have heard nothing but praise. (And yes before people think this is one bad experience  I have been in contact with BT on a weekly basis for months now... Have replaced equipment and wiring... And guess what- I'm still paying the bill. Cannot wait to terminate)~~~,London~~~,2018-02-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Have been with BT for about 12 years using their broadband and fibre services  packaged with a landline. The service has been very reliable and easy to set up. The one time we had problems  the router was replaced (for free) and immediately resolved the issue. However  despite the service offering up to 40Mb  we're lucky to get 20 - good enough for what we need  but not as good as advertised  and not likely to be good enough moving forward with the increasing demand for bandwidth. The price has also risen significantly recently - nearly a 30% rise over the last year. As a result  we're looking for a lower cost deal  either with BT or someone else. That's not reflective of their value over the length of our time with them  but of their current price and what we get for it.~~~,Hertfordshire~~~,2018-02-20~~~,4,5,3,5
I had been with bt over 3 year and I actually was puying more then a any new customer you will get notting for been loyal with bt and connection actually very very poor 6 mbps for 30.99 thats a a joke I won't recommend  bt to anyone walk away if u cann better then stay~~~,Enniskillen ~~~,2018-02-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Your time is valueless to BT.  Be prepared for connection failure followed by waiting in for a 5 hour window with no pre-call when en route.  On arrival the engineer will tell you the problem is their end as it always is (there's nothing in your home that can go wrong).  Mendacious incompetents uncontrolled by effective competition and consumer advocacy.  They make masses giving rotten service so why make any effort?~~~,cambridge~~~,2018-02-19~~~,1,1,1,1
