absolutely appalling service!  still not connected after 1 week of trying.  Tried to call to sort out and was put in a queue for over 1 hr on the phone.  The worst service i have ever received and would not recommend using this at all~~~,Notting hill~~~,2016-02-05~~~,1,1,1,1
I have bt sport  got a bill of 154.36 when I'm usually 10 pound a month  and when I phoned up they did say they had made a mistake and we're sorry  but I will have to wait 10 working days for a refund! They make a mistake and I'm the one that has to wait for my money that I need!!!~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2016-02-05~~~,1,1,3,3
Terrible customer service. If something goes wrong during your contract it is an absolute nightmare to get BT to help fix it  even when its their fault!I was left for 8 weeks without broadband & then they re-charged me all the activation costs on my next bill.~~~,Portsmouth~~~,2016-02-05~~~,1,1,2,2
"NOTE: This review has been given one star only because no stars is not an option.A series of problems since November 2015 relating to the date on which I pay my direct debit.  These culminated in BT's complete failure to take ANY payment in January  2016. The company sent me an email just after Christmas telling me they were going to put up my direct debit payment.  They didn’t taken any payment in January so I was surprised to get another email telling me my new direct debit would be for less.  The logic of this must be that if we don’t pay  BT won’t charge us.  I have spent what seems like half of my life trying  and failing  to resolve this matter by phone  email and online chat (BT's ""preferred"" option). Staff  both in the UK and in India  are rude  aggressive and not above lying if they think it necessary. There is no concept of customer service  and the technical aspects of BT's provision leave much to be desired: my broadband speed is well below the minimum advertised speed.  As soon as my contract ends I will be ending my 32 year association with BT.  The company must be doing extremely well if it can afford to alienate its long-standing customers.  AVOID at all costs.~~~",UK~~~,2016-02-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Iv been a customer for a number of years  overall it is working every day   videos sometimes lock up as speed is a little slow but thats about once a week on average  Cost is the part that annoys me  Lots of offers to new customers but no customer care for current customers i pay £18.70 pm~~~,Telford~~~,2016-02-04~~~,4,2,3,3
The service that you receive from BT customer service is an absolute disgrace  late in returning calls  phone the wrong number rude and unhelpful the list could go on. I have waited in 5 times for an engineer to look at our broadband never an apology couldn't careless.  And as for the slow and patchy broadband useless.  Would never recommend BT to anyone.~~~,Perthshire~~~,2016-02-03~~~,1,1,1,1
It's the worst broadband ever I'm apauled by the services. They charged us twice on the 2nd month and tryed to pretend that it wasn't them also the internets is always going on and off u are lucky if u get signal.~~~,Worcester ~~~,2016-02-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Utter rubbish. Broadband is glitchy and sometimes freezes when you have more than two devices connected. Customer service is a joke. Even if you get through to a good person they are not empowered to help you. And watch out for random charges on your bill. I have had ot have items removed several times before paying it. They also add extra charges to your contract over and above what was initially agreed without telling you.. If you read the small print it says they can raise prices at any time and you're stuck with it. The contract only works one way. If you decided to lower the amount you want to pay that wouldn't work! I also had a faulty plug on my hub. I called up to ask for a replacement and spent about 2 hours on the phone - 'you can't have a new one - ok can I use the plug I have from something else? - no that's not safe - ok can I have a new plug? - no - can I speak to your manager? - how can I help? Can i have a new plug? and so on... I never got a new plug... Cannot wait to leave them  it's just too much hassle having to deal with them.~~~,London~~~,2016-02-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
At first quite good speeds and reliability though expensive.  Then over the years the connections began to drop now and then.  I never complained as I thought they're the best out here.  Then today total failure.  I completed their diagnostic tests countless times with no joy.  Tried to phone their service status helpline about 7 times but only managed to get an automated message twice which informed me everything was grand where I lived despite the message being over 2 hours old.  I was then told to phone their helpline however it was constantly engaged throughout the afternoon.   Finally after 3.5 hours when I had just managed to get an answer on their helpline the broadband worked with no explanation.  Never actually spoke to an engineer just heard another automated message saying we are having problems and for me to leave my name and number for a customer survey! I did then get a phone call back from BT on my number asking who I was!  They then said oh we are having problems ourselves and so I cannot help you.   Brilliant.  I just hung up.  Useless company.~~~,"Ahoghill, County Antrim, Northern Ireland ~~~",2016-02-02~~~,1,1,3,2
Been with BT a day  engineer didn't turn up  broadband doesn't work  customer service continuely forward you to someone else  quite simply the worst company I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with  avoid BT at all costs~~~,Tain~~~,2016-02-02~~~,1,1,1,1
A 1 star is not suitable. Moved from bt to sky and wifi keeps dropping and I have to keep using my data mobile to access info  which works out to be more costly than converting to bt. Customer service desk have been absolutely Unhelpful suggesting that an engineer can come but will cost me 120 pounds to check for a fault I never ever experienced with sky. All advise from bt already stated in this message regarding bt support is consistent with how they are responding...take no blame to their service. Shockingly I am supposed to provide dates and times when it drops. A ridiculous request  since a normal user is not even able to monitor dropping of wifi for few seconds.  I regret moving now and committing to a 12 mth contract~~~,London ~~~,2016-02-01~~~,1,1,1,1
i cant get through on phone as they just hang up. the speed is much lower than promised. any problems you have they dont want to fix without trying to charge £129.99. should never have went with bt!. cant give no stars or half stars 1 star is still to good for the service you recieve~~~,ARBROATH~~~,2016-01-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Shocking customer service  BT have been scheduled to attend my property twice in the last week to install broadband and a landline. on both occasions they didn't turn up and the company made no attempt to let me know they wouldn't be attending. Go elsewhere for your broadband.~~~,Orkney~~~,2016-01-27~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
My tale is too terrible to tell in detail. 2 lines in 2 locations  swindled out of the Sainsburys voucher at one and problem after problem after problem with the other.  Terrible supply (cut off for 2 weeks over Xmas and New Year)  line keeps dropping  swindled by misinformation twice  misled over 'faster' broadband  hours and hours and hours and hours spent talking to people with an unintelligible accent. They are beyond belief.~~~,County Durham~~~,2016-01-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I have wasted too many hours of my life over the last six months fighting with BT  to leave a full detailed review. Just trust me and all the other many unhappy BT customers out there  that this company is best left well alone and I hope it will eventually die the horrible death it deserves! The customer service is the worst I have EVER experienced  the so called fibre optic broadband is slower that my old 'normal' broadband was  and most of the staff I spoke to were impossible to understand at best and mostly dishonest. Don't bother going to the Ombudsman about them either - they clearly work on behalf of BT and are as useless as a chocolate fire guard! Beware of PLUSNET as well; apparently they are part of BT  which explains why I had such bad service from them when I was with them a few years ago! You have been warned!!~~~,North Yorkshire~~~,2016-01-26~~~,1,1,1,1
I had a horrible experience with BT and was a long customer. They promised me a 60 Mbps speed and instead all I received was just about 2 Mbps. Absolutely horrible customer service. Was finally able to leave and switched to We Save who have saved me a mass amount of money and also provided me with a better service. Would definitely recommend We Save over BT.~~~,London~~~,2016-01-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
So it has come to this  writing a review in order to vent my spleen or in the vague hope that a miracle might occur and someone leaps into action  I'm being too positive. I moved home in April last year using the BT Home Move Service. Since the day I moved BT have continued to charge me for two accounts  one from the old home and one from here. To add to this they sneakily added BT Sport to BOTH accounts  absolutely without my consent  I never agreed to this..ever. The effort I have put in every month since April last year to get them to stop illegally stealing money from me is beyond words  I would honestly punch the CEO repeatedly in the face if I was ever to see him. Every month  hours of my time wasted on the phone to some other country  the promises that it is sorted I hear every time and NOTHING changes  the bills keep on coming. If I could ask the police to go and arrest the boss of BT for stealing my money every month I would. The customer service is outrageously poor in every respect  from understanding the problem to downright lies about how it will be sorted. How a company can get away with this time and time again is beyond me. BT steals my money and when they are caught they won't pay it back  even when they say they will  not a penny received  not a problem sorted. Unfortunately I don't have a choice here  the minute I do then BT can go hang. Makes me sad they are allowed to use the word BRITISH  they should change it to MAFIA Telecom.~~~,Acton Burnell Shropshire~~~,2016-01-26~~~,1,1,1,2
Ok  BT. The first product I bought with them was a BT Wi-Fi contract for a year. Half a day spent on the phone swearing and despairing  as their software could not process my credit check (no negative points  1 credit card  previous credit-checked long terms contracts  etc.). Eventually  after much frothing at the mouth  my partner got to speak to someone sensible who set the service up. Flash forward. A year later  setting up BT broadband. First the quoted engineer fee is charged even after I'm told there is no need for an engineer visit. Then the BT Hub doesn't arrive - at all. Then the new hub does arrive  but is missing a part without which it cannot be set up. Then I am patronized on the phone by being told 'it definitely was included  it is there' even after I have checked multiple times. After much foaming at the mouth  I am despatched replacement parts. Then the invoice comes  with a double delivery fee charged and the contract fee charged from the day when the Hub wasn't even delivered. Boy  I don't think you could do worse  BT  I really don't.~~~,London~~~,2016-01-25~~~,1,1,3,3
"If you want to get ripped off or literally throw your money down the drain by all means join up with BT if however you don't like being conned or value your money STAY WELL AWAY!not once have i paid the amount that i signed up for half way through my contract they raised there prices without even notifying me which then on top overdrawn my bank as i didn't have enough funds to pay the bill then they charge an extra £3 a month when you do cancel your direct debit which they don't tell you about and to top it all off now when i have called up to cancel everything then call up again a month later surprise surprise no acknowledgement of me calling no record or call log?!very convenient on there behalf now to actually cancel not only have i got to pay my outstanding bill they have whacked another £30 charge on top for cancellation fee!!beyond flabbergasted and beyond disgusted and if you ever want to try and resolve anything on your account when you call there ""customer service""number you are on hold every time guaranteed for at least 20mins before you even speak to anyone.And seeming as BT is meant to stand for British Telecommunications every time you get through to there call centre only once have i ever spoken to anyone british and this is me calling them literally over 100 times all there call centres are mainly primarily located in india where alot of them can't understand you and can't even speak english properly!Incompetent employees Incompetent Business and absolute sham of a company they should genuinely be ashamed of themselves avoid like the plague!~~~",cardiff~~~,2016-01-25~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been a loyal customer to BT for 15 years and the customer service  braodband speed and outages are getting worse. The latest upset is where BT has charged me for calling an 0808 freephone number. Therefore  I am now in a battle with BT and the Ombudmsman and cannot wait to switch away from BT. They are too big of a company to give two hoots to their customers  unless of course you are a business customer  then they will bend over backwards for you... If you have the option of moving with another provider take it (as long as BT do not own the line)...~~~,Gloucestershire~~~,2016-01-25~~~,2,1,2,2
problem after problem with bt phone line  broadband and tv since infinity contract began in june 2015. the helpline frustratingly regularly ditch calls. i estimate 30+ hours on the phone trying to sort things out  3 days lost work with engineers that don't attend. never experienced such bad customer service. currently waiting for engineer since mid december 2015 for tv problems (again) and now landline went down 6 days ago. there's not been one day of this contract that's been problem free. bt themselves admitted the other day that they may not be able to provide the tv service and may withdraw it from the contract which i hope means i'll be able to leave the contract early.~~~,manchester~~~,2016-01-24~~~,1,1,1,1

Had ADSL as a small business user since it took over from dial-up  17 years? Originally with ZEN who were excellent. Moved to a basic BT service to access wireless hot spots using own router. Worked fine. Was persuaded to take Infinity 1  our on-line world collapsed  2 defective HH5s  7 days later moved to new TP-LINK VDSL Router which was stable from the word go. Truly abysmal technical support from India  if you can 'get through' in any sense of these words. Incompetent staff and supervisors  promised call backs that never materialised  inordinate delays  replacements that take 3 business days to arrive (Amazon Prime 1 day). A thoroughly discreditable performance and speeds currently a fraction of those promised! What can I say  go elsewhere!~~~,"Wrightington, Wigan~~~",2016-01-22~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have just wasted another 30 mins trying to contact BT. My broadband while fairly reliable is appallingly slow. My download speed varies between 0.6 and 0.8 Mbps! I cannot access any streaming services. Although I understand my green box is enabled they won't offer me Infinity.~~~,Dumfries~~~,2016-01-20~~~,1,1,1,3
Firstly I have never worked for BT  or in any company related to broadband etc.  just used this service for phone & broadband since 2005.I have never had a problem with phone  speed or router which is still the original one I got free in 2005 and set up myself at my previous property and after my house move! Customer service on the two occasions I've needed it (with PC  no probs at all since I moved back to Mac) has been excellent. Despite being abroad  the advisors were helpful  knew their stuff  sorted the issues & rang back later to check all was well. Phoning UK just before contract expiry has allowed me to negotiate a better price each time and whilst BT is not the cheapest  I would never change (unless something happens in the future to alter my opinion).~~~,Huddersfield~~~,2016-01-20~~~,5,5,4,5
Since BT changed their e-mail client from Yahoo to the BT Mail version.i have been utterly frustrated and disappointed with the poorly designed user interface and functionality of the BT Webmail client. The e-mail layout is poor and un-inspiring.Couple this with glitches and freezing while trying to compose e-mails or execute commands such as moving a message to a folder a nightmare in itself due to the user unfriendly drop down box which doesn't always respond when clicking on a item. Then you will know where this review is heading! Worse still my outlook.com e-mail client will not work with the new BT Mail system due to the BT Server not accepting Outlook mails through it. The previous BT Yahoo service worked fine with Outlook.com! I could go on and on about this but instead i would like to give a final piece of advice to anyone considering changing to the BT Mail Webmail service.Don't!~~~,Colwyn Bay~~~,2016-01-18~~~,2,3,2,2
God Awful  Spoke to 5 different people and they told me 5 different things drawn out process and charged for a service not provided  broadband not provided until almost a month before contract begun and charged for extra month after being told 3 times they wouldn't (this is after giving them a months notice and phoning twice between this month notice given and months end to confirm no extra charges) They belong behind bars~~~,Chester~~~,2016-01-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Signed up to BT 17 MbpsGot 0.5!  i.e. 97% less mbps than we signed up for. We called to ask BT for help….they said they would “call us back” they never did. We asked to cancel our contract (Note receiving only 3% of the Mbps meant they were not providing use a service fit for purpose)BT said it would cost £140 to get out of their contract. As we have 90 days left in the contract we offered to pay to the end of contract and that we were giving advanced notice of termination. BT said only when your contract has 30 days can you give advanced notice (not 90 days  not 29 days not 31 days….1 day in the year that you can cancel)~~~,Surrey~~~,2016-01-18~~~,1,1,1,1
My true rating for them is 0 After 13 years of faithful loyalty to BT  finally I have had enough. Not only their prices were ridiculous but my Broadband was interrupted as from September 2015 for no apparent reason and all attempts to troubleshoot it or repair it by me or them had failed. I called for an engineer and while he was in my premises double checking the equipment since he couldn’t find any logical reason for a fault  the internet had miraculously worked!! The engineer had confirmed that he didn’t know the reason behind the loss of Broadband or its sudden return  and the only explanation he could give me that it might have been enabled from outside!!! A few days later  the internet was back to its former useless state. This had confirmed my suspicions that BT themselves had interrupted my services as a technique to force me to call so that I get hassled about renewing my contract!!!  So  I made it clear to everyone that I was not staying with them. Only less than a month after the expiry of my contract  I tried to leave but I was told that my contract was renewed!! I launched a complaint and was given so far three different deadlines they couldn't keep  to investigate how I was tied in a contract without my consent. Each time I called  they lied to their teeth about staff and they're messing me around. However  they are not giving me any feedback about the investigation and they’re playing the silent game.  This is unethical  fraudulent but more importantly stupid. By using this technique  BT might be securing an extension of a contract for a while  but they are also making that client so bitter with them to the point of no return. I know that BT is a big fish and won’t go down easily  but even sharks get caught eventually. Although I feel for individual employees as they’re just you and me  the organization as a whole had lost its values and ethical foundation  the very thing that worked to its advantage only a few years ago  and this  in my opinion  is the beginning of the end for them.~~~,"Barking, London~~~",2016-01-16~~~,1,1,1,1

"5 times I've ordered broadband. 5 times they have messed up the order.""it's a technical issue. The order has to be re progressed"". About 10 hours on the phone. Still no broadband. They never phone you back and won't register a complaint. If your a masochist with a penchant for having the same conversation 20 times I would highly recommend. Otherwise you could achieve the same level of hair pulling frustration and emotional pain by clamping your testicles in a vice.~~~",Hull~~~,2016-01-13~~~,1,1,1,1

I recently move to live in the centre of Europe's 2nd largest city. I was a previous (disgruntled) BT customer with 10 months left on my contract when I made the move to London. BT insisted on sending an engineer out for installation in my new home even though the previous occupant of my property was also with BT. This took 3 weeks  but I was prepared for that. When the engineer came he said that a) there would have been no need to physically disconnect the previously installed connection - but nonetheless it had been disconnected manually by a BT subcontracted engineer (not him though). and b) He thought there might be some damage to the connection which could have been cause by the previous BT engineer 'ripping out the connection' (obviously I can't verify this because this relates to the condition of the wires outside my building which I am not legally authorised to touch). Since installation my Infinity Unlimited broadband consistently fails at peek times  and is interment in the middle of the day. I work from home and I need to use  the internet during the day and during peek times - hence why I wanted an unlimited package. BT will do nothing at all for me because the internet is intermittently working (just not when you most need it to work!!!). I have absolutely no recourse and I can do nothing to solve the issue. I suppose I could pay over £100 to get an engineer out (I mentioned getting an engineer out and BT customer services advised me that they could send one but I would have to pay for it.. and wait 3 weeks). BT prefer their customers to hand over money for a fixed term contract and except whatever poor levels of service their antiquated nefariously procured telecoms system will deliver. All they have to offer me is their 'understanding' of my concern and frustration. Not anywhere near good enough. Hateful crooks.~~~,London~~~,2016-01-09~~~,1,1,3,1

This firm is basically satanic.  Utterly useless in providing service and then contemptuous in every conceivable way when dealing with any problem.  There lines and systems are basically not fit for purpose and they lie about this saying that your equipment is faulty.They deliberately tried to decive me on the inception of the contract.You would be better in my view with a length of string and two polystyrene cups.  I am now with a independent supplier B4RN which is awesome and has great customer support.~~~,Hodgson~~~,2016-01-09~~~,1,1,2,1
