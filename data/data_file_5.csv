Just read some reviews and realised that the worst service I’ve ever experienced is normal for BT  how can this company be so poor at delivering what they promise / organise  I’m going to email the CEO to see if they are interested or aware of how poor the BT company has become~~~,East Barkwith ~~~,2020-12-05~~~,1,1,1,1

I would not recommend BT to anyone. What should have been a simple and easy case of transferring my existing account and service to my new address when I moved house has been an absolute nightmare. They cancelled part of my order on my moving day took over two weeks to put the new order through (leaving me without a working landline or internet service for a number of days)  billed me for an increased tarrif at my old address account after I'd moved out  assured me that they wouldn't debit my account for this incorrect bill but did anyway  they've also set my new account up on a higher tarrif then originally agreed  and have ignored my last six emails to the Home Moves Team trying to get this all resolved (who'd promised me a call back two weeks ago  but who still haven't called me). I've also spent hours repeatedly on hold also trying to get through to someone to get it sorted (I'm currently on the phone to BT in a queue and have already been on hold for over an hour this morning). I've lodged complaints which have not been dealt with  and this is still dragging on six weeks after first advising them of my house move. Absolutely unacceptable way to treat their customers! I'll be raising this with the Ombudsman if BT don't get it all sorted out soon. If you're thinking of moving to BT I'd advise you to avoid at all costs  I'd really wished that I'd just switched to a new service provider when I moved house!~~~,Cornwall~~~,2020-11-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Router is excellent.  Full speeds on wifi upstairs. I pay fot 50Meg and usually get 42Meg.  No down time at all in last 18 months.  Free Anti-virus plus other perks etc.  Pricey  but you get what you pay for.~~~,Berks~~~,2020-11-26~~~,4,4,5,5
Horrible service ! Have paid for my contract with them  a month has passed and they still haven’t implemented the equipment and the wifi in my place. Have had 5 arranged appointments with them  and every time the engineer did not show up and did not even inform ! Completely unacceptable  horrible service and reliability ! Every time you try and contact them you have to wait for one hour  and every time someone says they will fix it and then the appointment does not got through ! Also  they promise to call you back  but eventually no once calls you  so you have to call them again and wait for one hour until someone replies.~~~,London~~~,2020-11-25~~~,1,1,1,1

After years of sub 5 Mbs speed  and waiting to be connected to fibre (about 300 yards from the house)  we installed 4G broadband.  We now get 30-35Mbs download  and about 10-15Mbs upload.  This may be pretty pathetic for city dwellers but if you live in the countryside you will appreciate that these numbers are high.  So if you live in the middle nowhere  like us  it might be worth trying a 4G service.  We needed an aerial on the outside of the house  but BT installed that for free  a rare example of good customer service.  We pay £50 monthly and are capped at 500GB monthly  but again  having tolerated miserably bad speeds for years we're quite happy at the moment~~~,Attleborough~~~,2020-11-15~~~,4,3,4,5
Worst service I have ever experienced. New installation  they ddnt turn up 2 times to the appointment. Finally intalled was working ok for a month and then they canelled it! A new order had to be  made and start all over again  have been without service for more than a week now and no end in sight. Pathetic. Avoid~~~,London~~~,2020-11-14~~~,1,1,3,3
Been without network connection for nearly 4 weeks now. Firstly i was told that it was an external problem and would be sorted within 5 days. I then had a text to say the problem had been sorted..... it had'nt. Another hour long call and they arranged a house visit and i had to wait another 5 days. I booked a day off work. At 2.30 i had an email to say i needed to book an engineer to fix my problem. I telephoned bt again an they said (this is where the lies start) an engineer had been and there was nobody at the premises. The engineer then phoned my mobile and i cancelled. I asked the advisor if he could confirm the number the engineer rang and the number i was given did not belong to me  or anyone in my household.Another appointment was made for the following day  guess what! Yes it was cancelled again  through an email telling me again that i needed to book an engineer. Another hour long call to bt  this time they could'nt give me a reason as to why they had cancelled. I told them i wish to terminate my contract with them and they told me i had 12 months left and would have to pay the outstanding amount(£460)  The first oppertunity i get to leave this supplier i will. They said openreach was the problem and they they do all the broadband regardless of my supplier. I said that bt are the company i pay and it's up to them to provide the service i pay a lot for.~~~,Wrexham1~~~,2020-11-10~~~,1,1,1,1

Our experience with BT is absolutely horrible. We signed up with them only because they were the only provider offering over 100mb speed at our current address. They booked us an engineer visit on two occasions which they've missed (both)  then 3rd time lucky  but leaving us without internet for 5 weeks. Now we are moving home and they can only offer us 30mb to 60mb at the new address. They wanted us to sign a fresh new contract on 30mb for a further 24months. Of course  we want out of our contract since they cannot honor their part of the deal & Virigin can offer us up to 500mb. They are not allowing us to leave without a buyout fee which is ridiculous. Since they want us to go on a fresh contract  it only shows that the old one does not stand.  Absolutely horrible.~~~,London~~~,2020-11-05~~~,1,1,1,1
"Internet down for 2 weeks now. From first day promised will come back in 24 hrs - never did . Both my wife and I opened complaints and got ""assigned case owner ""- never heard back ( not even an email nor phone call ) - and now my complaint marked off as completed and resolved without any feedback or progress . Openreach staff told me outside on main road it was their fault as they mixed cables - transferring greenboxes on the first day of internet loss . I wish I could mark no stars on this - but Trustpilot only allows me to mark lowest 1 star - absolute appalling ( both of us rely on the internet at home for income - during covid . If my phone signal was good enough in area or if I had an alternative option - I would have swapped already .~~~","Burton , Christchurch ~~~",2020-11-04~~~,1,1,1,1
An absolute joke of a company in terms of service and looking after your new customers. We were due internet on Friday and one and a half weeks later we're still speaking to support to even get an engineer sent out. The initial engineer wasn't able to complete work outside the flat due to requiring a hoist to get up the pole  however he just left and never told us even though we were just across the road. Had to phone back  get another engineer booked for Wednesday  never showed up. Had to book a new one for Friday  now there was an error in their booking system and so never showed up.  Booked again for the following Monday  and yet again the same system error meant that no engineer showed up on the day (we only find this out after each of the no-shows and not in advance) Now we've been told that the 'error' is meant to be fixed by Tuesday and only then can we book an engineer again which will likely be at least another few days to a week.  All in all we set up to become a customer over a month ago to be live 2 weeks ago  seems that planning ahead means absolutely nothing. The empty promises and poor service is endless  and at this point any trust in the company is completely gone.~~~,Dalston~~~,2020-11-02~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I wanted to post this as a complaint on their site but before I had finished posting it  it was already closed. Showing they clearly care about your feedback. I can't be bothered to change this text so that's it's not directly addressing them but I want to post this to get this off my chest. So keep that in mind.My situation was this  I am currently using BT in my apartment and have been doing so for a year and a half. Recently  I bought a new house and the keys to the house would be handed to me on the 19th October. In anticipation for this day  I went to the BT website on the 6th of October and had ordered for new broadband to be set up for the 22nd in this new house. On the 13th  the week before  I received an email saying that this order had been cancelled. Confused  I called in to BT to try and understand the situation. I explained my circumstance to the person on the phone and asked him what could have been the reason for the cancellation  and he said he did not know. I then asked him if it was possible that the people who were currently staying in the house who were about to move out  were the ones who cancelled it and he said it was possible. Okay I said  I could see how if the previous tenants got a call saying that their internet was going to be changed (granted that it was going to be taken over on a date where they would not be in the house) then I could see how a mix up could occur. I asked the man on the phone if it would be possible to make the order again and which time it would be best to do so. He said that it would be alright to make the order right away if I knew I was definitely going to be at the house by the 19th. I said I was sure I would be in the house by then  but I wanted him to be sure that I could make this order and this would not happen again. He assured me that it would be fine. We make the order again and I can see that it was made for the 27th of October. This is a lot far down than I would like it to be but I thought it was fine if this is the best time they could do and I know things are stressful at the moment so I don’t want to push anything. A week passes and the weekend before the 27th comes around and I receive no notice of BT making their order which I thought was odd as I thought BT would always give me small reminders that they were coming. Especially when you compare it to all the process of all furniture shops and gadget shops that I’ve been seeking patronage from for this new house as this is the standard process for all of them.The 26th comes around and the delivery of my equipment has not been made yet. I track my order online and above it says that my order is cancelled but below it looks as if my order is still on track for my house. Confused  I call into the BT help desk to ask them what the true status of my order is. The guy checks my order and says he noticed the cancellation that was made before but that this current order is still on track but there were just some delays. He said that it should really arrive the next day or the day after. I feel relieved as he has reassured me that the order was still on track and happy that I could finally set up my internet so that I could move in and get my house together while working from home.The next day comes and nothing arrives  and no email or text message arrives telling me they are still making the delivery. I decide to call in again to reconfirm that the order is definitely on its way only to be told that this new order was actually cancelled by the previous people again and it was done on the 15th. Now I am seriously confused and frustrated and extremely disappointed. I tell the assistant I had not received any message indicating that this had happened and that someone had told me yesterday that the order was on its way. She apologizes profusely and says there’s nothing she can do except make the order for me again and that it should come on the 10th of November. I ask her if there is any way she can move it up and she says no. I feel really dejected at this point so the lady encourages me to call in until someone makes a cancellation and I can take their spot. I felt a bit better after hearing this and decided that I would try.Now today comes which is the 28th of October  and I decide to call in to first check the status of my order to confirm it is definitely on its’ way and to see if there were any cancellations. The man that answered assured me that the order is on its way but told me there was no way for me to take the spot of cancellations and move up my date. I told him this was not what was told to me the day before and he tells me that the lady must have been wrong. Again  I feel dejected again and he apologizes by giving my £10 credit for my phone (which I won’t use) and that he will lodge a complaint for me but frankly  both things don’t make me feel better about the situation. Now I completely acknowledge my fault in trying to order the internet before I had fully moved into my new house. I should not have assumed that because I had paid for the house  had a date set for when we would exchange keys and know that the tenants were definitely moving out that the process would have been smooth and without hiccups. However  I wish to address the parts that were lacking on the BT side and were improvement could be added.1.Communication – the first problem stems from the fact that I did not receive an email or text message or a phone call or anything letting me know of the second cancellation. Had I been allowed to know immediately after  I would have waited for the 19th to come  knowing we had full rights to the house (so there should be no reason for a new cancellation)  and made a new order where it wouldn’t take so much time for my internet to be installed.2.Staff collectively and consistently knowing the process – As I stated above  I talked to several people within BT in order to sort this out and I was given very different information from all of them. If it was a situation where I stayed quiet and just accepted everything at face value  then I wouldn’t make such a fuss for this point. But that was not the case  I constantly asked questions in order to reassure or reconfirm my suspicions. I asked the first guy if it were possible that the order could be cancelled again  and he said it would not. I asked the second guy if the order was still on track and he said that it was. I asked the third lady if I could call back and move up my installation date  if there was a cancellation and she said that I could  only to be told by the 4th guy that I can’t. What is going to happen if I call the 5th time? What is going to be contradicted now? This is the genuine paranoia that I have been left with and it will not fade until I am sure there is internet in my house. I understand staff having flexibility to appease their customers but knowing what limits can and cannot be set should be understood by all in order to not create any confusion.3.Lastly  making the process faster – I am not going to lie  this point comes from a more selfish request  but I still want to be able to voice it. I understand that fulfilling orders can be hard especially in a time where we are in lockdown and we are supposed to be appeasing to social distancing rules but I find it so frustrating when I have ordered something and it is consistently pushed back more and more and more. I made this order early because I wanted to make sure everything could be organised. If there is internet not only could I start living in the new house and effectively put furniture together  but I could start working properly from home for the new job that I just acquired. I would not have to spend money on bus tickets or expensive taxis so that I can be there in time for furniture orders just to go back through the same method to my apartment for work. I would not have to spend exorbitant amounts of energy going from my apartment to my house and back again just to sort things out. I wanted to sort out my apartment so that it could be left in good condition and I could get my full deposit back. I most importantly I wanted my house to be sorted out before my family came for the holidays.Overall  I think that BT internet has been exceptionally good however you have issues when it comes to first delivering that service to people. I have lived in different places for work and education and this issue with delivery is not the first time I’ve experienced this. There was even a time where I ordered for your broadband service and it did not start working until after about 2 months and a half and this was mainly due to the fact the house was not suited for the broadband that I wanted  so someone had to come in and physically install it. Waiting at this point was not an issue because I had access to the BT public Wi-Fi  so I was able to do the things I needed to do and the situation wasn’t so dire. However  at this new house the signal is so bad that I cannot connect to anything and therefore I can’t do anything. This issue where the house is not suited for the broadband that I want  could happen again but I would not know until I try to get the internet started and that would lead to more waiting which again will just make me more frustrated. I am not expecting any improvements on my situation to be made I just wanted to voice my frustrations in the hope that in the future  me or anyone else do not have to go through this.~~~,milton keynes~~~,2020-10-29~~~,3,1,3,4
Broadband keeps cutting out. Had more serious outages in 3 months with BT than 10 years with Virgin. BT can only book engineers a week ahead  and even then they aren't guaranteed to show up. Even when they did turn up they sent someone to fix the phone rather than the broadband. Avoid at all costs  really poor service.~~~,Amesbury~~~,2020-10-26~~~,1,3,1,1

Hindsight  they say is a wonderful thing. Had I read the reviews before deciding to try BT I would never have agreed to a contract. At the moment I am two weeks without internet. Thanks to a neighbour I'm using their internet. If possible I would give zero stars to all of the above. I spent over an hour on the phone trying to speak to someone on Wednesday and when I did get through I was told I would be getting a call back on Sunday  that's tomorrow for an update. When I contacted them over two weeks ago about an engineer calling to investigate the problem I was sent a confirmation email from BT but two minutes later a second email was sent telling me that there was a delay so they couldn't give me a time when it would be addressed. I won't say fixed because I can't see that happening. I may just have to cut my losses and ask for a disconnection. I'll probably pay through the nose for it but at least I can try another broadband company. Maybe someone more reliable. I see positive review here but to be honest I think they must be from BT staff either that or someone who is being paid to write imaginary reviews~~~,London~~~,2020-10-24~~~,1,1,1,1

I was having problems trying to switch over to BT from virgin (virgin is excellent but a little pricey) Tried to contact customer service and had nothing but hassle.

They are not worth the hassle.~~~,North east~~~,2020-10-10~~~,1,1,1,1

The internet it is realy not working att all  i have the round hubb what they bragg about but it is only for disighn....not pleased at all and i canceled the contract.

Drops in speed all the time. Zoom calls cut off regularly. In these times of home working we need a more reliable service.

If you're thinking about switching to BT broadband because of the BT reward card incentive then beware. They seem to be making it difficult to claim this  despite them claiming it should appear automatically on your account. My own experience was that the reward card never appeared on my account. After contacting live chat to enquire about this  the adviser said he could not transfer me to the relevant department and told me to phone instead. This would have involved wasting more of my time because of the long waiting time on the helpline. A quick Google search of 'bt reward card'  and filtering by the past month shows lots of people complaining about not receiving reward cards  showing this is a current widespread issue. So unless you're prepared to waste time chasing this up  then don't expect to get the card. The broadband itself has been excellent. I'm on a FTTP connection which is fast and reliable. It's just a shame that this experience with the reward card has soured my opinion.~~~,Cambourne~~~,2020-09-17~~~,3,1,5,5
I get 73  Mbps download and 18 upload on BT Fibre 2 package. I am lucky being just 120m from the fibre junction box so the copper wire last leg is relatively short. When things go wrong (about once a year - usually the service suddenly slowing down or needing frequent modem reboots) BT support has always been very fast and efficient. If they cannot fix the line remotely  an engineer has always arrived within a couple of days and the latest modem sent by post - all at no extra charge. You don’t often hear this... but I think the BT service is excellent.~~~,Sevenoaks~~~,2020-09-14~~~,5,5,5,4

I thought paying top whack prices would equal top whack service reliability etc - it doesn't - looking at the reviews you are just as likely to experience slow speed patronising unapologetic customer service providers as you are paying half the price of BT - I am swopping to a cheaper provider for what I imagine will be the same poor experience but at least I won't be paying 50 quid a month for it~~~,Watford ~~~,2020-08-31~~~,1,1,2,1
Such a terrible provider  download speed always fall short of the stated speed (e.g the stated speed was 11-13mb  and I am constantly receiving speed less than 5mb) and the pings are always spiking (varies from 30 to 500). The worst is that the slow wifi plan is even more expensive than some of the optical fibre plan provided by other competitors  I had no other choices as there is no optical fibre in my area. If you have other option BT should be avoided at all cost  extremely terrible.~~~,London~~~,2020-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Have recently moved home and simply wanted to move the service across  but this seems to have been an unnecessarily difficult process for BT. Have had multiple orders cancelled for no reason over they last three weeks  which they cannot seem to stop doing. They say they will call back to sort out  but never do  resulting in me having to call them back. Previously the broadband had a tendency to cut out at least twice a day. It takes a good while to get through to any customer service reps  and even when you do  whilst they are pleasant enough they can rarely solve your issues there and then. Don't even think about asking for discounts for inconvenience  because they won't even consider it. Have been a loyal customer for a good while  but enough is enough and it's time to move on.~~~,London~~~,2020-08-30~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
Awful awful awful. Two weeks with no internet. Engineer supposedly came - no change. New modem sent. No change. Back at square one after two weeks and now have to wait yet another week for another engineer. Been told I cannot cancel contract unless BT fail to provide a service for 90 days!!! How can that be fair? They can fail to provide internet for three months yet I must still pay. Disgusting. Can't wait to leave...~~~,Surrey~~~,2020-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1
