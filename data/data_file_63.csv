Four months no internet  4 promised call backs and Indian call center operatives  who I'm sure are very nice people but cannot deviate from a script and will not help your cause. DO NOT TOUCH BT WITH A BARGEPOLE~~~,HANTS~~~,2015-07-17~~~,1,1,1,1
My phone line hasn't worked for over a month. I raised a ticket and they said they'd fixed it but they hadn't so i re-opened it after which  nothing. So I phoned them (06:30 am) and got straight through to Gibson. He was very helpful  checked the line and confirmed there was a fault. He raised another ticket and it is due to be fixed within a week. Plus I get a refund on my line rental. So apart from the delay in getting the line fixed  customer support were very helpful~~~,Kingston-Upon-Thames~~~,2015-07-17~~~,3,4,4,5
"please  please  please do not sign up to BT. The customer service if utterly shocking!!! I have now been without a phone line and broadband for days. I have wasted hours of my time trying to sort it out. You get through to an Indian call centre and communication is sooo frustrating. I can't understand what they say and they can't understand me. You will constantly fobbed of with ""we will connect you to a different department"" or ""it will sort itself out tomorrow!"" But it never does. I have tried everything to leave BT but we are tied in for a year - I am even considering just taking the hit. In summary no one cares  no one is interested in actually helping you and if you don't want to feel like there is just no hope then go to another company.~~~",horsham~~~,2015-07-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Absolutely awful..broadband slow customer service unhelpful i changed back to bt thinking it would be better but i was wrong..i received my bt hub and the next day i get a bill for over £50 ..for what i asked and they said that it was my monthly bill..absolute joke.000000 review~~~,Farnham~~~,2015-07-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
EVERYONE!!! Please Read This!!! I was with BT but the money I was paying P/Mth was too much... I got 7Mb/min unlimited B/b  landline  unlimited anytime calls - Now I pay the same to a Diff provider but I get 32Mb and satellite TV and landline and anytime calls and unlimited fibre plus a free 32 inch LED TV!!!!! BT have a lot to answer for if you ask me.~~~,Rasharkin~~~,2015-07-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful customer service from the call centre!! So rude was hung up on after asking very nicely to speak to someone who spoke English as they're call centre is based in India and couldn't understand. Such slow speed! And now they are telling me to get a booster and pay out another £30 after going over phone contracts numerous amounts of times as the wifi won't even reach 3m away. Would defiantly not recommend them!~~~,~~~,2015-07-14~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT are liars. Firstly they never supplied the Sainsburys vouchers after I joined and have queried twice. Secondly  I was promised a phone call after I complained that I wasn't getting BTSport on my devices and it never came. Having spent probably two hours trying to explain my problem I was left with no satisfaction. I even gave control of my computer to them and they ended up telling me exactly what I told them within the first minute. I am now paying for a service that I am not getting and BT really don't care. I have written a letter to them and still no-one has the decency to call me or sort out my problem.  Absolutely avoid.~~~,Ballymena~~~,2015-07-14~~~,1,1,3,~~~
This service is an absolute disgrace. Customer services / technical faults mislead and lie to you. The broadband speed is no way near what was promised and constantly cuts out. Complete and utter waste of money. And they will not even release me from the contract despite not providing what I asked for! The technical faults team have been talking to me for three months since I had the problem. Initially I was informed they merely had to ensure it wasn't a wireless problem and they would reset then boost the line. Well  I ran all the speed tests and used an Ethernet cable for my broad band direct from the socket with a new filter as requested. Still rubbish. They therefore reset the line. Then it still didn't work. I raised it with them on the phone and they advised I wait 20 days. Still nothing. Then a call  they blamed it on a wireless problem inspite of the tests showing that that it wasn't - they wen reset the line. They then stated they couldn't guarantee wireless speed. I raised it with other representatives via twitter and got the same answer in a long and pointless email.  The broadband never goes above 3.5 Mbps and is often much less. The line constantly drops out. Watching films and multimedia without interruption is a pipe dream. I was promised about 10mbps. Yesterday my partner was told that nothing was guaranteed and that I had no right to cancel. She was told to consult the small print. The sooner the OFCOM changes come into place allowing me to quit the better. I cannot dissuade you strongly enough. BT is not the firm it was and they do not care about the customer or quality of the product. They just want to squeeze a margin out of you. Go with Virgin... I never had a problem with them and the line was awesome!~~~,Wright~~~,2015-07-14~~~,1,1,1,1
After waiting in for three seperate engineer appointments I still haven't seen an engineer  each missed appointment resulted in me phoning BT to be told a different lie about why they never turned up. Three weeks after placing my order I have now been guaranteed (for the second time) that my engineer will connect me on two weeks. Apparrently my order got stuck in the system.~~~,stafford~~~,2015-07-13~~~,1,1,2,2
Utterly useless in all aspects  over a month with speeds of less than 0.5 via Bt speed test through their customer service  and I get told to update my laptop  or buy fibre.  I have had trouble free Internet  not very fast  7mb  for four years  then they take me off exchange only line to a cabinet and I cant do anything  can't watch TV  load a photo  send and email or pay for anything  the connection drops out  or it won't stream at all.  All this for over £43 a month.  Accelerating the fault to a complaint has just landed me with even more Indian call centre people ringing me  but they won't do anything other than test the line  after a month of testing every three to five days I've had enough.  As I Say USELESS~~~,ST Germans~~~,2015-07-13~~~,1,1,1,1
"If I could give Zero stars I would - it is absolutely terrible  abysmal  appalling  shameful  not fit for purpose  over-priced dross! Need to move to somewhere that has Virgin cabling so at least I have an option as Talk Talk  etc. all use BT lines so cannot be any better than BT who are the pits (Being very polite with my adjectives  but BT ""narrow""band and BT E-mail must be about the worst products I have ever used. Would advise anyone I know to use any other provider - nobody can possibly be worse.~~~",GU47 0ZA~~~,2015-07-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband is super-slow.  Customer service continued to reel off the speeds from their internet site and would not accept that they were talking BS.  Calls taking so long as its hard to understand the BT staff abroad.  Basically the same as what many people have written here.  BT broadband is almost useless  cs are awkward and lie and shift the blame.  The reliability is virtualy zero.~~~,Milton Keynes~~~,2015-07-11~~~,2,1,1,1
They are useless  left me without internet for my first week as a new customer coming from another provider. Not recommended at all. Can't solve any problem with them. Avoid~~~,London~~~,2015-07-10~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is a joke- Low speeds and line dropping for hours at a time for over two months.  Technician visited and checked my equipment said there was a problem with the exchange to my property.  Call centre called me to inform me of the progress of the repair and told me that the case had been resolved.  I told her what the technician had told me and the speeds i am getting is not the same as what i was told i would get when i entered into a contract.  She spoke over me  would not listen and told me i was trying to get compensation.  I called the UK base customer service and they were the same.  An absolute joke~~~,Croydon~~~,2015-07-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely disgusted at the dishonesty & fraud bt commits & gets away with they lied about the broadband speed lied about bills & customer service is a painfull experience its as if youre talking to people programmed to be as unhelpfull as possible left bt so free at last free at last god bless me im free at last.~~~,~~~,2015-07-09~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Two weeks ago my broadband usage suddenly shot up from 8.64GB on the friday to 16.46GB on sat. I'd been out most of the day and knew it couldn't possibly be right so I contacted BT on their online chat and a gentleman called Zahid spent about 20 mins trying to find out what the problem was. He asked me to monitor the usage for the next couple of days  and advised me how to change my wireless password  (which I had long since forgotten.) Then sent me a text message and said to reply to it with a time they could call me if the usage was still high. On the monday it had gone up to 25.73GB so I sent a text  and someone called me back within 15 mins. He said there had been several complaints from customers about higher than usual usage and they were working on a solution. He assured me I wouldn't be charged for the excess usage  and sure enough when my bill came yesterday  there were no extra charges. BT get a lot of flack for their customer service  but on this occasion  I am very satisfied with the service I received.~~~,Shropshire~~~,2015-07-08~~~,4,5,3,4
Broadband connectivity is weak - drops out much over 10m line of sight.  The most dreadful customer service ever experienced. Only deal with BT if you're prepared to gamble on not having an issue to resolve. Be warned.~~~,coventry~~~,2015-07-08~~~,1,1,3,3

"I recently contacted BT to complain about the amount by which my line rental had gone up.  Maurice asked me what I wanted him to do!  I asked him to justify a 15.5% increase on last years subscription  he muttered something about profit margins and shareholders.  I was told that he could not do anything about the price  I then asked to speak to a manager and was asked ""why""  I replied that I would like to speak to someone who would not patronise.   My request was refused adding that a manager could do nothing about the price  and that ""this conversation is going nowhere so I am going to terminate the call""  Maurice then promptly cut me off. I called back and got through to someone in India  who made a note of my complaint about the rudeness of Maurice but said nothing could be done about the price increase.  I was also told that if I wanted to cancel my Broadband at the end of its contract in December there would be a £30 cessation fee!!!!!!!Forgive me but I thought that once a contract was finished  you were free to go to an alternative provider without any penalties.Maybe someone can explain how BT can get away with increasing their prices in this time of austerity by 15.5% and how they can charge a fee AFTER the contract has finished.~~~",Kidderminster~~~,2015-07-05~~~,~~~,1,~~~,~~~

7 months into a 12 month contract and still no reliable wifi despite many many phones calls and hours spent on the phone to overseas call centres. The icing on the cake of course is that this month  that is 7 months into a 1 year contract BT have increased the price of the HD extra package and introduces a £5 per month  charge for the free BT sport channels  the channels that were advertised as free with BT broadband. And all this while I am still within the 1 year contract. Appalling service and conduct from BT. Never have I been treated so badly. Can't wait to leave and never return.~~~,Gloucester~~~,2015-07-02~~~,1,1,1,1

I went for BT fiber optic broadband for the great service BT offered in the past. During the installation I was disappointed to learn the modem had to remain near the main socket  which was on the ground floor.  I thought to myself if the speed and connection will be optimal I may not need the ethnic cable  something I used to improve the speed.  From the very start I encountered issues connecting the wifi to my devices. I noticed the password had to be re-entered each time I reset my laptop and on some occasion the password appeared unrecognised. I was then forced to retype the password several times before achieving a successful connection. This got worse overtime  after several consultations with BT technicians over the phone  the only solution I got was to reset the modem when this occurred. I was then compelled to walk to the living room from the comfort of my bedroom every other night just to connect my laptop to BT's wifi. I did not expect this poor  service whilst paying premium price for the connection.~~~,London~~~,2015-07-02~~~,2,1,3,1
ever since we had broad band it's been ridiculous kept going of or would not work bt said upgrade so we did now it's a joke to get through to customer services you just get put through to somebody who can't even understand English they always say there's no manager we have had this for nearly 12 months now they promised to ring a few days later to see if things were any better but never have surely wiyh technology they should know there just fobbing people off all the time I am now looking to speak to somebody to speak to to cancel and a refund they are charging me for something I don't even get and I know quite a few people it's happened to~~~,Featherstone ~~~,2015-07-01~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
If anyone reading this wants good broadband most definitely do not go to bt  this company has left me so stressed  backing you into a coner to fix speed etc  then you get tec team telling you the copper wires are swollen cause it's warm etc etc then when i try to cancel a guy tells me if i don't pay all this money they will send the baliff in. I could go on and this is only 2 months with them.~~~,Limavady ~~~,2015-07-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute joke  rang several times to complain  had several test carried out and told all ok. Obviously myself and family completely in the wrong even though we were ones unable to continually connect to the internet. Had an argument with one representative who said we had never complained and there was no info on our records........really.

Customer service is shocking  it took four months to finally fix a fault slow service  buffering  losing connection during that time I had to deal with some very rude people who kept talking over me and no compensation when it was finally resolved.  The broadband can be excellent but it's not worth using because of the hassle if you have to use customer services~~~,swansea~~~,2015-07-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Struggling to describe the quality of BT fibre broadband without the use of swear words... Total dog crap springs to mind. The reliability and speed is shocking  almost from day one I have experienced regular outages in service. Can't wait for my current contract to end. I will never buy into a BT broadband package again!!!~~~,Leeds~~~,2015-06-30~~~,~~~,2,~~~,~~~
Just switched to BT broadband few days ago and found that the braoddband speed very slow at times and connection unreliable. By replacing the BT home hub (router) with my netgear dualband router solved all the problems.~~~,London~~~,2015-06-30~~~,2,2,3,3
Not one day goes buy without having problems with connectivity. it takes an age to get speaking to someone and they then get you to test the speed wired  despite repeatedly telling them its with wifi the problem is. They told me the equipment I have is no longer used as it is out of date but they wont supply a new hub. We have the TV package as well  apart from BT sport its crap. Had to get Netflix. Not a patch on SKY tv.~~~,CO ARMAGH~~~,2015-06-29~~~,2,1,2,1
Initially went on a 9-month unlimited broadband package  however the bills always kept coming higher than the set contract price. After 9 months  when I called to cancel  I was told that the 9 month contract was only for Internet so we had to pay extra cancellation fees for the landline. To make matters worse  after 'cancelling' their services they supposedly took 2 weeks to process the cancellation (during which I ceased using their services as I had already moved out of the flat) yet they sent me a bill charging me for an extra month. When I called to investigate  customer services were rude and patronising. They said they'd refund me the money by deducting them from my cancellation fee and so the matter was dismissed. A week later  when my cancellation bill came through  I found that they had only deducted  £1.20 from it. Appalling to say the least. I will never be returning to BT again  it was a waste of money and time.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2015-06-29~~~,1,1,3,3
Supper crab service  worst ever. We ordered the internet in last February  and got installation until April after many calls. When we moved house at the beginning of October  BT changed us 200 pounds for moving  and again took another one and half months for the reinstallation. Now we can not tolerate the slow speed  and wanted to cancel it  100 pounds for penalty.~~~,Sutton ~~~,2015-06-29~~~,1,1,1,2
My broadband speed was really poor but when I reported this to BT they sent out an engineer within 2 days and fixed the problem.  This was only a few days ago and so I cant really comment on the long term but so far so good.  Their customer service was excellent.~~~,Co Antrim~~~,2015-06-29~~~,4,5,5,4

I have been with BT for 6 years and I am moving home at the end of June and i read on the internet about giving notice to BT one month before when moving to avoid extra charges On the 9th of June i phoned BT asking to stop my contract at the end of the month. I confimed twice with the customer service saying i was moving out on the 30th and i needed the landline till that day  he assured it was ok and i wrote everything down. I immediately received an email saying i was getting disconnected the day after. So i promptly called back saying i didn't want to be disconnected the day after  they said there was nothing to do and the disconnection was on the way and there was nothing to do about it.I begged to keep my connection as i need internet for work they ammitted their fault but they said there was nothing they could do. The day after i got disconnected by BT and that was my landline and broadband gone. I called BT several times and they said i would have been reconnected the day after  3 different people assured me i was going to be reconnected  but nothing happened. After 2 days i called back and they told me i would have to wait for the following week to be reconnected.After that call i received an email saying i was subscribing a new 12 months contract and the reconnection fee was 50 pounds. (!!!!!!) I never asked any of that. When the week after i finally got reconnected the internet wasn't working and i put up with being with no internet for 20 days waiting to move out. I just gave up talking to them. A special mention goes to the customer service department  all they do is:- asking your details- asking to hold on while they check- transferring your call to someone else- asking your details again (since the new speaker doesn't know anything about you)- asking you to hold on again while they check- transferring you again or lying and saying everything is ok. They have been lying to me so much about everything  the timing  fees  procedures  speaking to customer service is pointless or actually bad for you because they create troubles instead of sorting them out. Conclusion:- if you speak to BT the only communication you should aknowledge is the written one you receive by post or email.Everything said on the phone is unreliable.- if you want to cancel BT  just tell them the day before  they don't need any notice  they will charge you anyway 43 pounds for the disconnection  unless you cancel at the end of your 12 months contract.- If you can  avoid BT at all costs.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2015-06-28~~~,1,1,1,1
My review of BT is that BT is the worst internet we've ever had at my home. I got told that I'll be happy with this internet speed so I can still be happy in making my games with a fast internet connection. After 3 months they went through to floor. The worst people we've ever had to deal with. Broadband speed  Ridiculous. Customer Service  Not good. Reliability  Not good.~~~,Nottingham~~~,2015-06-27~~~,1,1,1,1
