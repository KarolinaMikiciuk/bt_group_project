Bt came to transfer our broadband from plusnet  but managed to mess it up and we have now been left with no broadband and no phone for the last fortnight with another fortnight until they will come out again. Where we live we get little if any mobile connection and rely on the broadband for work. Although after an hour trying to rebook a new visit they have behaved very badly making us wait for a month for something they did.~~~,"whitford,Holywell~~~",2020-08-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Our Fibre Optic box shared with  other occupiers of our small building in London EC1 was isolated as the probable fault  as to  why only our office and no one else in the building  had no  internet. Monday we made contact. It was almost certainly a switch  that needed to be pushed at Open Reach's  end but they could not do this without a job no. This took 3 days  to organise. The engineer then arrived late one afternoon  and did his best  but could not determine the fault and had to return to another job.  It turns out that  it  ialmost certainly is the OR switch  and we hope  after over a week without internet    it will soon be fixed. Meanwhile   we installed a Vodaphone 5G system as back up-even if China can allegedly interfere with this!  It  seems to be performing better that fibre optic  so we  we may ditch  OR. I hate poor service as my busibness would not survive if we gave this  so I  happy to ditch OR and never depend on them again at the first opportunity-JP~~~,London EC1~~~,2020-08-12~~~,4,1,3,3
Moved into a new build property in July 2020 and as an existing customer signed up for their 'easy' home move system. All communication up to our move date was positive  orders confirmed etc. and 3 weeks notice was given. No internet on the day following move in so contacted the customer service team who said the line could not be activated because of a records issue. This was the company line for 2 weeks (we still were without internet during this time). After two weeks the internet started working but was not at the speeds we were paying for. I called numerous times and spoke to numerous people  each one as clueless as the last and it took these two weeks for BT to acknowledge it was there error and apologise! I was subsequently told that BT would need to re-order our broadband and phone which would take a further days to organise and then another 3 to process the order. This was due to happen on August 10th. I then received a call saying that the order had not been actioned and that we would have to wait another week. This issue is still ongoing and BT have seemed to be uninterested in resolving for us. We are in a new build property so are unable to move to another provider and this is clearly why they do not feel any pressure in finding a resolution.  I cannot stress how little I would recommend this company. Throughout  I have had to chase and clarify details at my own time and expense and was also still issued with a bill during this period without internet access. This was only refunded after I raised this as an issue.  Terrible processes  terrible customer service and seemingly a lack of interest in getting our issue resolved within a timely manner. Save yourself stress and inconvenience by choosing another provider.~~~,Bristol~~~,2020-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
If I could give 0 stars for speed I would. We live in a rural location  HOWEVER across the street from us there is ultra fast broadband. We cannot get access to it because we are on a different exchange 2miles away. This means we get 2mbs while my neighbours enjoy 800mbs. We are all working from home these days and are utterly dependent on good broadband. BT does not care and will not help. I have spoken to them for 4years consistently trying to find a solution. Our jobs are on a knife edge and if we do not get better broadband soon we will have potentially lose our jobs and home. Tell me BT how do I explain to my 7 year old that daddy and mommy longer has jobs because of bad internet.~~~,Crediton~~~,2020-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful service! AVOID ! I was waiting for their engineer for all day which never turned up. At the same time BT bombarded me with warnings that missed appointment will cost me £130! It seems my time does not cost a penny ! To resolve a problem it takes 40 minutes of holding and listening their arrogant music. The problem never gets resolved from the fist attempt. What a shame! If I knew  I'd never sign contract with BT.~~~,London ~~~,2020-08-10~~~,2,2,~~~,~~~

Three months no service this year (2020)Five days after finally fixing the latest fault BT inform me my line is due to be ‘taken over’ by someone else.Despite informing BT this is incorrect and being assured the process will be halted...BT end all my services. They then bill me £555.23 for cancelling my contract early!Empty apologies  unable to reconnect without taking out a new contract and ignored calls. Now failed to meet a promised call to discuss ‘my complaint’ (!)... Truly truly awful. Please go elsewhere  this company are beyond self help PS. I couldn’t give less than one star sadly.~~~,Faversham UK~~~,2020-08-05~~~,1,1,1,2
Don't use BT if you live in central Birmingham. The broadband is terrible. I also had several issues with them when I moved apartments. I moved in the same block and they couldn't fix my connection issues. They made me wait 9 months after which I gave up and ended my service  Also they have absolutely awful customer service. You wait a good 20 minutes on the phone only to have no help until you threaten to leave their service. Complete waste of time and money~~~,Birmingham~~~,2020-08-01~~~,1,1,1,1
I made a change of house I took BT  but they started to charge the rest of the old contract  I called and they said it was incorrect  not to worry  4 months later  I receive a letter from their company of 475 pounds debt recovery  and I'm still a customer.  In addition to being incompetents they are liars.~~~,Chippenham ~~~,2020-08-01~~~,~~~,~~~,3,5
This has been the worst customer service I've ever received not only from a broadband provider but also from any service in any industry!!Shocking lack of communication and always lying to their customers. Took them 33 days to fix a broadband fault!~~~,Swindon~~~,2020-07-28~~~,~~~,~~~,4,2
Shamobolic customer services  different excuses and story everytime I phone.  Given up trying to work things out  logged issue with Ombudsman.~~~,Southampton~~~,2020-07-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Been with BT for far too many years and we have to keep calling about the same issues :( they can't even get our name and address correct.  Diabolical Customer Services and never a person whose first language is british.  Want stress free... don't go to BT~~~,Balmedie~~~,2020-07-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Un reliable broadband service which can only be guaranteed if you pay the extra cost of having a 4g router as a back up when the broadband fails. Usually 3 or 4 calls to 151 to get an engineer to your home who leaves saying there is no fault at the premises and has to investigate at exchange. Not happy with a service that costs a considerable amount more than competitors. I thought by using BT I would get a premium service as they owned the copper and fibre cabling as well as local exchange premises and hardware. Not recommended by me  as an experienced BT customer.~~~,St Clears ~~~,2020-07-24~~~,1,2,3,2
Bt just don't want to listen to their customers.  They make promises which they cannot  and do not  fulfill.    Getting to talk to a manager is harder than getting blood from a stone.   If they actually did what they say they are going to do that would be a change for the better.~~~,Brighouse~~~,2020-07-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Unfortunately I'm unable to judge the speed or reliability of the broadband as I've been waiting since February for it to be installed and it's still not done. Whilst I appreciate that there were obviously issues during lockdown  I had 3 appointments cancelled pr lockdown and have now had a further 3 since things have reopened. If I have the misfortune of having to contact BT  I'm usually kept waiting for about an hour until someone finally answers. 9 out of 10 times the person that I'm speaking with is unable to solve my problem so tells me that someone will phone me back. Nobody ever phones back. Last week I finally grew tired of it all and told the person that I was speaking with to cancel the order  to which they replied that there was nothing to cancel as there was no order in place! You really couldn't make it up. To anybody who reads this and the other countless negative reviews for BT yet is still considering going with them  please consider using another provider and hopefully save yourself countless hours/days/months of frustration.~~~,Orpington~~~,2020-07-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Quite possibly the most incompetent and shambolic customer service I have ever experienced! 6 phone calls and 12 hours of being on hold and passed about and we have now moved into our new home a month and still no broadband. They are completely useless! Would go elsewhere except we are still on contract. Biggest mistake ever  wish I had stayed with sky and that is saying something.~~~,Banbridge~~~,2020-07-17~~~,1,~~~,3,3
Poor signal strength  only good when in the same room as the hub. Even then the signal strength fluctuates. Rude and abrupt customer service staff calling to ask why I'm switching to another supplier. Won't be returning.~~~,York~~~,2020-07-17~~~,2,2,2,2
I may as well put my monthly bill money and burn it. BT are worthless is almost everything they do and offer. From day one it has been slow and broken without any response. Small print prevents me from taking action and with a completely unusable service I am stuck paying for something that’s terrible. You should be ashamed BT but I’m sure you already know this!~~~,Doncaster ~~~,2020-07-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Hopeless! I would be embarrassed to be part of an organisation that promises so much yet delivers so little. Unreliable Broadband signal and speed; promised 4 years ago we would definitely get Fibre - and still waiting; engineer comes and everything works for about 48 hours then starts to collapse again; there's always something that's not working as it should. With all the technology available  and given how much we all rely on it  Broadband / phone line should be as reliable as water and electricity .... but it never will be as long as BT have the monopoly. Can't wait for contract to end so we can move somewhere else (even then their antique copper wire will no doubt still trap us).~~~,Bristol~~~,2020-07-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Worthless. 1hr wait first time  1.5hrs seconds time. Promised £50 credit. Never appeared bloody worthless. Got about 5 channels only  not even main channels.~~~,Harrogate~~~,2020-07-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Really poor customer service. Considering that they are a communications company you would expect a certain level of competence  but they don't seem to be able to communicate with themselves  let alone with their customers. To save you a world of headaches  please steer well clear of this company!~~~,Wooburn Green~~~,2020-07-10~~~,1,1,1,1
"I have been with BT fibre for about 3 years now and to be fair  I don't get many issues. But damn  when you do have an issue are they shockingly terrible at fixing it! I'll explain the problem I have; 2 weeks ago I woke up to not having an internet or phone connection. After a few phone calls (on my mobile) to BT they sent me an engineer the next day.The next day arrives and the enginner turns up on time  all well so far. 3 hours later he figures out that my fibre cable had been disconnected from my port in the underground rack  broken in the process and put back into a different port. Basically a contractor stole my connection for someone else.He then fixed my cable and plugged it in to a new port telling me that BT would need to disconnect my connection on one server and reconnect me on another as I'm now using a different port  which ""should take 24 hours"". 2 weeks and many...many phone calls later  they should have me disconnected from my old connection by friday the 10th. So now I am looking at 3 weeks of no phone and internet for them to disconnect a connection and connect a new one. That is actually abysmal customer support and service on their part  for a problem that shouldn't have happened in the first place.~~~",Cornwall~~~,2020-07-06~~~,1,1,4,4
Stay away!Horrible experience with BT you get missinformed from day one and then they change your contract and ask you to pay more without telling you.Also they refuse to let you open a complaint and most of the people you speak to over the phone are racist and rude!~~~,UK~~~,2020-06-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Took a new contract out with BT on 28 May for 2 years. On 12 June they cut my broadband off by mistake. Rang on 12 June and told it would be reinstated 14 June and they would send a mini hub to be going on with. As you may of guessed nothing happened on the 14 June nor at any other time until today when I was informed the order had been received by Open Reach was going through and I should be up and running on 29 June - don’t hold your breath. So the previous five phone calls I made to the connections team were a waste of time as I was told a pack of lies by each of the customer services people in Stoke. Absolute waste of time and effort trying to get any sense out of them. Couldn’t care less about their customers. Rating below zero.~~~,Norfolk~~~,2020-06-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I've been with BT for 2 years and everything was Ok until I moved homes. Since then it's a constant and very frustrating 2-month struggle to get connected.During these 2 months I've been connected through a mini-hub as a temporary solution and trying to get connected properly as the mini-hub connection is really poor.During these 2 months I've been in contact with BT a countless amount of times  spoken to many of their staff members  spent every time an hour on hold while they were forwarding me to different departments and trying to figure out what's going on with my account. The inconsistency of their work is really shocking. Each one of them says different things and names different problems but the job is still not done. During these 2 months I got a number of contradictory messages from a number of BT staff members: your broadband will be activated tomorrow just connect your router at midnight  your broadband is in place but the landline is not  we need to send our engineer  our engineers don't go to the households due to the lockdown  your engineer will arrive on Wednesday  our engineers don't go to the households  your engineer will arrive on Friday  your appointment is cancelled  your appointment is rescheduled  our engineers don't go to the household  your appointment is cancelled again  your engineer has arrived and sorted everything out  connect your router  the engineer hasn't been there nothing is sorted we will schedule another appointment  your appointment is cancelled  get in touch to schedule another one  your package is fine  you are not at any package  no  your package is fine...Halfway through they forgot to add some allowance to my mini-hub and I had to spend one day with no Internet whatsoever. And it was my working day so my work was paralyzed for the whole day.After 2 months an engineer from Openreach arrived sorted out the broadband and the landline and the Internet was working for the whole day. Next day the connection disappeared and another BT team member said that somehow my broadband hasn't been added to the package so I need to wait another 5 (!) days before it gets activated. I have no idea how after 2 months since my move the broadband hasn't been added to my package.So far my experience with BT was incredibly frustrating and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.~~~,London~~~,2020-06-25~~~,1,1,4,4
The internet seems to work when it wants to work. Recently i was having too many sessions where internet just stops working  especially annoying when i wanna play games with boys and the internet just disappears. Disappointing because there is literally nothing to do during the lockdown.~~~,Romford~~~,2020-06-19~~~,1,1,1,1
I thought I was the only one until I read the reviews for BT. I am paying £39 PM for their Complete Wifi package. It is the most incomplete service I have ever experienced and they do not care about the customer.I have had broadband issues every day since 20th May with speeds between 0.9mb and 40mb. Most times it is less than 10mb which kills my Sky Q mini boxes. A total of 5 engineers have been booked but only 1 actually turned up  the rest...who knows because BT certainly didn't know what happened.I am thinking to cancel my payment and see them in court.If you decide to go with BT  then you only have yourself to blame  I certainly regret it.~~~,Rayleigh~~~,2020-06-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Switched from Now TV broadband to BT and supposed to have over 50mb. Can't even use the printer and constantly lags and is buffering. Signal strength says excellent but it isn't and all troubleshooting brings us back to the internet. Never had problems with SKY or now TV. We got BT because it's cheap and it's shockingly bad always have problems. Do not sign up with BT~~~,Wiltshire~~~,2020-06-12~~~,1,1,1,2
Our broadband is hopeless. We have been arguing the issues for years with BT - it seems that they find a fix which is acceptable (barely)  so we go away  and then a few months later  it all goes wrong again and back to square one. The ratings given would be 4 zeros if that was an option.~~~,Hamptworth ~~~,2020-06-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Luckily my 18 month contract for 'Superfast' broadband is drawing to a close and I cannot wait to change. It may be Superfast somewhere  but certainly not anywhere near my router.  There is a reason that you get 'Free' BT hotspot access with your package; the broadband in your home only works about a 3rd of the time so you'l  spend the other time connected to this hourly service. Oh  plus it isn't free when you compare the p[rice of BT to other providers.Since pretty much after the line had stabilised I have had connectivity issues that have warranted engineer visits  numerous router replacements and constant resetting of the router and checks of the line.  Regarding the router  I have no problem picking up my neighbours WIFI or even BT Fon  but can my devices ever find my own router?  Of course not.   Trying to get hold of BT to discuss any issue is also an issue in itself.  If you can navigate the web page and actually find their contact details they would far rather fob you off into their 'community' than talk to you in person.  The fact that there exists a community of disaffected customers in the first place says it all  really. Price wise  far  far too expensive for what you receive.  Do yourself a massive favour and look elsewhere.  I will not make the mistake of utilising BT again.~~~,South Wales~~~,2020-06-05~~~,1,2,2,1
DO NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACT WITH BT! Sorry for the capital letters but I really cant emphasize this enough. I signed an 18-month contract with BT. The broadband speeds were incredibly slow (less than 1mbps) to the point where I couldn't event open emails. BT were unable to fix the problem but flatly refused to free me from my contract. I consequently had to get my broadband from another provider (Hyperoptic) while continuing to pay BT every month for their useless internet...so two monthly broadband bills! The BT staff are extremely unpleasant too. Since their service is so poor I suspect they are unable to retain customers based on quality  so instead focus on making leaving contracts as difficult and time-consuming as possible. Their website is a perfect example of this. Avoid at all costs!~~~,"London, UK~~~",2020-06-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Everything they do is with the purpose of taking your money off you for a product you aren’t getting and they know they can’t provide. Guaranteed speeds  with £20 back if they don’t meet your minimum  actually means; they don’t monitor your speed at all and the ‘speed test’ app they provide to check it yourself  will tell you your speed is ‘as expected’  when it’s less than a 3rd of what you’re paying for. You’ll get £20 if they can’t fix your speed in 3 months and charge you £50 per month while you wait. Wow  awesome deal BT. I think the misinformation on the speed app is fraud  so I’ve reported them to Ofcom. One final warning before you make the same mistake I did. They make it as difficult as possible to complain. You can only complain by phone and each time you ring  it’s like it’s the 1st call you’ve made. I’m waiting for a manager to call me back. I’ve no confidence at all that they ever will. Apparently the call back was ‘guaranteed’ to be within 2 hours. I’ve since called back and been told I’m in a long queue and they can’t give me any idea when I’ll get the call. I feel like they’re stealing from me and I’m contractually obliged to accept it. THIS IS A TRULY DISGUSTING COMPANY. I’ve actually registered on Twitter with the sole purpose of warning off as many people as possible. Think I’ll start with #boycottBT~~~,Sunderland ~~~,2020-05-30~~~,1,1,1,1
When it works (90% of the time) it's brilliant.  When it does not  then customer support is a nightmare - press this  press that  hold ................ AND it's not cheap ! Had to apply for the credit twice when BT Sport went off line due to COVID-19.~~~,RBWM~~~,2020-05-29~~~,3,3,3,~~~
Terrible company.Had an issue with my broadband which took over a month for BT to fix. Made a complaint and was promised on 7 occasions that a case manager would contact me... None of which were fulfilled. 3 months of chasing them and they eventually came up with a compensation offer far lower than what thier advisors had assured me I would receive for the time with poor Internet connection. Very little care for thier customers  often increasing monthly fees mid contract~~~,Warwick~~~,2020-05-27~~~,1,1,2,1
Absolutely useless company  been with bt for years but not anymore  I phoned to report my broadband kept dropping out and was below 1mb  Was told i needed the full fibre package and that would sort it out  Nothing changed only the size of the bill considerably increased  Since then they have come every few weeks to try and sort it including digging a trench through my lawn  All of which made no difference  All the engineers admit i am paying to much for a low service  But when you call the customer service department they seem to think the service is okay  No other provider can give me any better connection but they are a lot cheaper  So much for customer loyalty.~~~,wymondham norfolk~~~,2020-05-26~~~,1,1,1,1
"BT should be avoid at any cost from any one. Probably because the COV19 make them loose money they drop to less than 1GB my connection for the las tree weeks. I phone on BT so the man on the other side of the line say that :tomorrow morning we will send a technician"" and bla bla and then he change his mind and say we will send a technician in 11 days.

It is unbelievably slow  inconsistent and if you don't reset the router every 12 hours it doesn't work at all I have never been able to play my games without experiencing lag. Customer service is very poor sending you to someone who tells you to do what you've already tried and know doesn't work.

I have infinity two with unlimited calls. Great speeds. Only had a problem once which was due to a day when we had constant power cuts. Person on the phone was great and all it needed was a reset. My only complaint is the price at £71 a month while other providers are a lot cheaper. I have looked at their reviews and they are much the same as the bad reviews here and a lot of the complaints are about speeds dropping. Do I take a chance and go for the cheaper provider that’s y dilemma.~~~,Isle of Barra~~~,2020-05-18~~~,5,5,5,5
Abysmal. Over the three years I've been stuck with this cowboy outfit I have been plagued with problems. Slow speeds  constant disconnections  price rises mid-contract  engineers not bothering to turn up  a thousand and one  carbon-copy answers which solve nothing. Incentive gifts never turn up  mobile signal is the weakest I have ever experienced  the list goes on. It even took them a whole year to get my name right on the contract!
