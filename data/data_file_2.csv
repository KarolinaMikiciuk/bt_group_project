Terrible costumer service. Wasted 1.5h setting up a contract. They misspelled the address and now they are asking me to redo all 1.5h of setting up a new contract. They can not change a simple details THEY got wrong. Ridiculous.~~~,London~~~,2021-09-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Waste of time you don’t get any where near the speeds you pay for. The customer service is awful put simply don’t bother~~~,Birmingham ~~~,2021-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely irresponsible service. The engineers didn’t turn up on the date I have been given. When I called BT customer service they don’t have any clue/ they did not contact the open reach. The date I was given was 3 weeks after order — very delayed set up dates.Even after waiting 3 weeks nothing has been done by them.  Then they have me another 3 weeks time. Which means 6 weeks for installation. No communication from them. I had to call millions of time to understand what’s happening. And when you call each person come up with differing information. Basically I fed up with the long wait and moved to virgin. They gave me 1 week time to set up. Let’s see what virgin can do!~~~,Datchet~~~,2021-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Waited over a month for a refunded bill. Refunded me £5! Had to to ring multiple times this week to chase and get my full refund of £40 to be told today I would be receiving it by check in the next 10 days. Quick enough to take it tho! I cancelled within the first week coz your engineer couldn't be bothered to fit the router in my living room and left wires all over the floor when I have a 1 year old and a puppy. Nothing but hard work. Wouldn't advise anybody to use BT~~~,Preston ~~~,2021-09-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely vile to go for. Awaited for 3 weeks now. Got our first appointment last week and the engineer could be bothered coming out  got told we had been booked in yesterday 1/09/2021 and they changed it to today 2/9/2021. To then find out the engineer has not been bothered to come out again. Had a text to say they will review and book me in for a couple weeks time. We live in an area of no service and need internet and when they make 4 failed promises on us and don’t stick to their agreements it makes me think is the owner actually disabled? Does he has something wrong with him? They’re lying scumbags who just want your money and won’t provide a service. I’ve got better chance of having a gangbang with the hottest pornstars than them following through with their promises. Ugly little turds.~~~,Cleveleys ~~~,2021-09-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Overall I have been very satisfied with the broadband both it's speed and reliability. But I can't give a rating for the customer service as it is almost non existent. Up to this year I have never had any issue but since June this year after making a complaint BT have given nothing in the way of customer service. They keep using the excuse of the pandemic but that is all it is  an excuse for not keeping in contact with loyal customers. Very poor.~~~,Tunstall~~~,2021-08-31~~~,3,~~~,4,4

You have to wait for them one month to come and install but when you are waiting for them they put your appointment 15 days later without telling you  after two month since I ordered I had to order another broadband.worst customer service ~~~,Uckfield~~~,2021-08-26~~~,1,1,1,1
A few years ago  my BT Internet was really bad. It was never good but it became so awful I was getting less than 1MB. This is over about 5 months. Sometimes no internet at all. I complained numerous times to BT. I was lied to. I was ignored  and when I told them they had to sort my Internet out  or I'd leave  they arranged for a BT engineer to call at my house. I waited in all day. He never came. I had to stay off work for that visit and when I rang BT to complain  they told me an appointment hadn't even been booked. I was furious. I'd had enough of their lies and very poor 'service'. I left BT and subscribed to my internet elsewhere. Before doing that I asked if I owed BT any money and they said no. In fact they owed me 3p. I left it at that. A year down the line I got a letter from a debt collector saying that they were representing BT and the 'DEBT' I had incurred with them. Apparently just after leaving  BT had slapped a £420 fine for leaving 'out of contract'. Yet for me they BROKE the contract by not supplying a service. I was outraged. I finally had to pay the 'debt' because it went to the County Court. I had never had any outstanding debts in my life. But that filthy dirty company BT made me into someone who has a debt collector on his back  and now I have a black mark on my credit report. Disgusting  appalling. And I had to pay £420 plus COURT costs. AVOID!~~~,NEWCASTLE~~~,2021-08-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Shambles from tech support to chat support.  False promises on new hub delivery times and costing me more money... almost as if it was a strategy to make more out of existing companies.   I've lost trust~~~,Paisley ~~~,2021-08-24~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2
Worst wifi ever  dosent even work properly cuts out every few minutes if i could rate it no stars i would.just because every other company buys there supplies from here dosent mean its a good company. sort your wifi out we switched from sky because its cheaper to use BT  but definatley wasnt worth swapping  the wifi and signal has never been so bad ever. had to buy 8 boosters that dont do anything either  waste of your money~~~,Solihull~~~,2021-08-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Dealing with BT was a frustrating and futile experience from start to finish. Two months after signing up for an ultrafast fibre to the premises (FTTP) service  I had to cancel my contract as BT had utterly failed to install the service. They blamed Openreach whom they said were going to replace a telegraph pole as the existing telegraph pole was alleged to be unsafe for the engineer to climb. At first I was given “ a 100% guarantee” this would be done within two weeks of the original installation date  then given a series of other dates by which this work was to be done  but nothing ever happened by any of these dates. I asked to speak to a BT manager  this was refused  i made a complaint  nothing was done. I asked to speak directly to Openreach  this too was refused.  BT never got in touch with me to explain what was going on at any point  I had to phone them repeatedly.  Every piece of information BT gave me was incorrect. It became clear that Openreach had no intention at all of replacing the telegraph pole. Even now  BT continue to advertise that FTTP is available in this area despite knowing it isn’t as it can’t be installed due to openreach engineers refusing  to climb the old telegraph pole and Openreach having no intention of doing anything about thisI had to keep extending an expensive older broadband throughout this period with no apology or compensation offered by BT. A miserable  experience a from a dreadful company.~~~,Scotland~~~,2021-08-20~~~,1,1,1,1

It's the worst thing I've never experienced. For the past few months I had a nightmare with this ****** company. I nearly got fired because of you're internet conection. They promised me that I would have minimum of 5MB/s and I have 0.8MB/s  I've opened 5 complains about this and no one cares as they said: there's nothing we can do about it. They've charged me for a things that I no longer have. They're the worst. If you need a broadband  do not choose BT.~~~,South Elmsall~~~,2021-08-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Its hard to rate a company that offers such a blend of incompetence and dishonesty. If they tell you a thing will be delivered on a date it wont be  when they assure you they are sorry they are not. They are so useless its to the point when you think it would be less effort to be do the job right~~~,East Sussex~~~,2021-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst customer service I have ever experienced. I made two complaints and both completely ignored. Having set up a new BT broadband service 2 weeks prior to my move in date there was some difficulty receiving the equipment. After waiting for the service start date it didnt work. I phoned help  service and after 2 hours talk to different staff was told the service had been cancelled because the previous BT customer at that address refused to let me take over the line. BT did not inform me  and then I got a threatening letter telling me to return the equipment or I would be charged. I logged complaint and was told someine would call me. Nobody called. Another 2 hour phonecall from me and a second complaint resulted in new service being ordered  and told I needed a whole new set of equipment  and send the first lot back and wait 11 days for connection. I  was told there would be a £20 goodwill credit and be offered compensation for dreadful service  but no evidence of this. Service now working  no contact re complaints deamands to send initial equipment back even though no prepaid envelope received  and demands for payment even though I set up a direct debit initially.  Complaint now going to ombudsman and once contract us up I will never use BT again  be warned they are the worst customer service ever.~~~,Hastings~~~,2021-08-11~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2

Going for BT was the worst decision that i made Very disappointed The strange thing that I ve been disappointed twice ! One in my business broadband and last one here in my house !!!!! Very poor support very poor customer service Their big name now is clearly for me is a big scam !~~~,London ~~~,2021-07-26~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
They cannot even successfully deliver their package to your address!!! I booked Halo 3 on July 9th  but I never received it from that day. Royal Mail said that my address is wrong because BT gave them wrong address. I contacted BT's customer support by phone nearly twenty times  everyone said he can help me  but finally  they didn't correctly change my address. It's supprizing that they continuely make the same mistake so many times. It looks that they realy doesn't care about their client. I've had enough with BT. Never use it again!~~~,london~~~,2021-07-25~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT business for almost a year and that is a year too long. I had problems with BT for about three months before I was even signed up. When they eventually installed my broadband they did not connect the line at the exchange  so the only broadband I was getting was either through a BT hotspot or the 4G dongle. After hours on the phone and online chat  they discovered their mistake but all the offered for being 8 months without proper broadband was £25 off my bill.I will be leaving BT as soon as my contrack expires and not a single day later.~~~,Penzance~~~,2021-07-25~~~,1,1,2,2
Absolutely atrocious service. Our internet has been offline for about a month. On the best of days we get a download speed of 1MB/s and upload speed of 0.3MB/s. We were promised at least 1.5MB/s. We are paying a ridiculous amount for our broadband. It’s ridiculous how we can be charged the same amount as someone who gets fibre optic with a broadband speed > 30 MB/s  so x30 more than what we get.Openreach have been attempting to fix our internet for about 3 weeks  but it is still not working. Our poles have not had any service/maintenance since 2001 according to one of their engineers.They have offered compensation of £8 per day until our internet is back up and running. This might cover the cost of the monthly broadband fee… but what about all other services we pay for that require WiFi  such as Netflix  Amazon prime  Alexa  etc?I believe that the government were targeting for the whole of the UK to get a minimum broadband speed of 10MB/s to all homes by 2020. Clearly they have failed to keep to this promise. To make things worse  there doesn’t seem to be any urgency or reassurance that they are actually trying to achieve that target anytime soon. They dismiss any possibility of fibre optic to our area.It’s such a shame that there are no other providers that we can turn to  otherwise we would have years ago. If you are thinking of using BT as your main provider  I urge you to do some research and check other providers first - I believe Virgin have their own boxes therefore they can offer a different internet line to your home.~~~,Ormskirk~~~,2021-07-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst company I have ever dealt with.  I had an issue with my broadband that kept dropping up to 7 times a day and then 5Mbps speeds. Me and my partner both work at home and found this impossible. However BT could only send us engineers. After 10 engineer visits and 12 hours of calls to and from BT the outcome was to leave free of charge however no compensation was applied. My stress levels dealing with this company has been more than ever in my life to the point where I had sleepless nights worrying about the integrity of my job but BT weren’t having none of it.~~~,Kent~~~,2021-07-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Engineer didn't show up for the activation. They sent me his number in the morning to contact him - he didn't reply to calls nor txt. Supposed to come between 8-1. Then was contacted by the company that arranges the engineer's visits to say that he will come round. - waited til 6pm - nothing. No response to txt nor calls. Then BT called in the evening saying the need to  rearrange the appointment. Not so much an issue if you don't work but I have to take another day off work and being self employed it's loss of earnings.~~~,WEST WICKHAM~~~,2021-07-14~~~,1,1,1,1

Please avoid.My second experience with BT after 4 years. Nothing has changed  they just advertise better. We pay £30 pm to have a 4mb speed. We have not gone over 10 mb since we started the contract 2 months ago.Called support  they said we will get a 4G hub to help with the connexion - never came. Apparently you have to pay for accessories to get the most basic service that you were already paying for....? what?! no thanks.engineers have come out twice and both times the conclusion was: the cable is eroded. We asked for it to be changed  they refused and said  we'll try something with the box outside. Obviously  nothing has happened and we are now waiting for the 3rd round of engineer  while still paying for a service that does not work. Super. Please avoid. Get Virgin  it's just as bad.~~~,Bristol~~~,2021-07-08~~~,1,1,1,1

2 appointments not attended  delayed our office opening for 2 weeks and counting. The first appointment was booked for Thursday the 24th of June  the engineer just didn't turn up. Our office was due to open 28th June but couldn't as VOIP phones and no internet! They then booked an appointment for Friday 2nd.....  didn't turn up again. Called again this morning 5th July  they cant look for another appointment until 8th July..... so we will be at least two weeks of having people not able to work. You just can't trust this business. UPDATE we now have the next available appointment for 13th July. So 19 days after it should have been. Hopefully 3rd time lucky!~~~,Caerphilly~~~,2021-07-05~~~,1,1,1,1

STAY WELL AWARE AT ALL COST. Broadband is terrible. I called customer service and after being on hold for two hours I told them I want to end my contract because I’m moving to Sky. They said ok there will be a fee of £94. I paid the fee and a few days later they wanted another £125. Will not pay. They can send the queen of England to my door for all I care. There broadband is terrible always freezing and I will tell everyone I know to never get. One day hope this company has to close down.~~~,Colchester ~~~,2021-07-01~~~,1,1,1,1
"Absolutely terrible and criminal customer care! At least Dick Turpin wore a mask! Arranged a house move  internet should have been on since 17 Jun 21 but instead they switched it off! Numerous phone calls being passed from department to department where staff lie on the phone  fob you off and even huff when calling them as I must have disturbed them doing nothing whilst working from home.  Now three weeks since they should have switched on my broadband they continue to aviod explaining the issue saying ""it's a supplier issue"" and telling me I am stuck in a contract with them when they have failed to even start the service. If an individual done this  they would be a fraudster  so BT  you are a company of fraudsters.  Customers beware  AVIOD BT WITH A BARGEPOLE. You will not acknowledge any of my calls for three weeks now maybe some honest reviews may force you to review your customer care policies!~~~",Woking~~~,2021-06-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Only able to contact during daytime hours yet its always at night the internet goes down - a regular occurance - very unreliable and often due to 'service' maintenance they seem to do most nights and so by time you can call to complain its back on and their customer spport is aweful and do not want to know that yt again you were withoout internet all through the night~~~,Telford~~~,2021-06-22~~~,3,2,4,2
I'd rate my experience ZERO if I could. Ordered mid April... it’s now mid June. Initial activation date was cancelled as more work needed. BT lied over & over again  and tried to fob me off. Complaint is ongoing. Despite OpenReach surveying  planning visiting twice  complex engineering taking the line to the adjacent property  the engineer (who didn’t turn up for the initial appointment) failed to actually take the line into  was is under 15m  to the property. Gross incompetence! Numerous calls with BT to try to get the problem sorted and then receive an email  and SMS  to say my line has been ‘Activated’  ‘Ready to Use’ and BT 'Hope I'm enjoying it'. As OpenReach and BT have closed the matter  all BT can do is raise it as a 'fault'. A fault on a line I don't even have! Presumably I will now be charged for a line I don't have. Now it's beyond GROSS INCOMPETENCE.. it's unbelievable. BT Customer service worse than useless!~~~,Scotland~~~,2021-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1
I cannot give any stars to BT  I have been with BT well over 40 years and I have seen the service from BT deteriorate. When I first purchased the super fast Broadband I was getting speeds of 74mbs but now I am lucky if I get the guaranteed speed of 36mbs but the WOW in this I can if I am lucky get a max of 42mbs  what's that all about?. if you look at the value of this service that I am paying for then I am paying twice as much for just on half the speed from my original contract. I have raised this issue with BT on a number of occasions just for it to fall on deaf ears. And another big bug bearer is that they have installed the main box in my bathroom where this high moister level?  I am looking at an alternative supplier.~~~,Bangor~~~,2021-06-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT reuse to let me leave without paying the rest of my contract fees despite not giving me the service I signed up for. To leave I must pay £197. I have a ADSL Internet connection which  despite ridiculously slow upload and download speeds which I tolerate  continually loses connection and displays the dreaded ‘yellow light’ on my router signalling a loss of service  REPEATEDLY  10-20 times a day!! BT offered many ‘workaround’ fixes  free phone data  new routers (x3)  engineer visits etc. After my need for a better connection became essential due to large file upload/download for work  up to 6GB+  I decided to leave BT and join Virgin Media which was cheaper and has impressively fast fibre broadband in my area. BT then claim  what for it  that my loss of Internet connection isn’t technically a ‘drop’ in service and happens simply because the accompanying landline has a fault on it!! I explained  it doesn’t matter what or where the source or location of the problem is  all that matters is I’m not receiving the service I should be. To which they respond with their final word on the matter (after long debates and endless transferring from department to department) that my Internet has only ever ‘dropped’ connection twice during the last year and has always been ‘provided’ otherwise and it’s the problem with my landline that causes the problem with the Internet connection at my end  and therefor  because they’ve continued to provide broadband at the speed contractually agreed upon from their end  I am not free to leave without paying the rest of my contract!! Can you believe it!! I said it doesn’t matter what you provide at your end  what matters is what I receive at my end  AND I RECEIVE REPEATED DROPS IN SERVICE!!! I DO NOT CARE WHAT PART OF YOUR SERVICE/NETWORK IS BROKEN  I DO NOT RECEIVE THE SERVICE I PAY FOR AND I WANT TO LEAVE WITHOUT BEING CHARGED £197 TO DO SO!!BT refuse to budge so I must pay £197 to leave a broadband contract that is regularly interrupted by a fault on the accompanying landline. What can I say except  BT  shame on you  after my years of loyalty  you treat me like this  SHAME ON YOU!!~~~,London~~~,2021-06-15~~~,1,1,1,1
BT's service is appalling to the point of being fraudulent.  I have had 9 visits by incompetent workmen who in most cases could not complete the work they came to do. I have also had 2 appointments cancelled without any notification.  It's now 4 months since I started the contract and I still do not have the full service I paid for. Customer service is unhelpful and do not care if your installation is working but are only concerned with your payments. I have been lied to about the cost of the service and given incorrect information about future increases. I believe they are knowingly defrauding elderly users such as myself and I will be reporting BT to Ofcom.~~~,Chelmsford~~~,2021-06-15~~~,1,1,3,1
