Absolutely dreadful service DO NOT USE BT.  Four times I have been told the fault would be sorted that day and 4 times they have failed to do so and failed to contact me saying there's an issue.  Every conversation I have had with them they have assured me it will definitley be done that day and said the issue was at the exhange. I then called today as the fault is still not fixed and was informed that an engineer came to the flat  three days ago; engineer didn't even borther phoning when he couldn't get in.  Having not been told soemone was coming I wasn't in. Two days ago I spoke to BT and no reference was made to the engineer turning up the day before and again they assured me it would be sorted within 24 hours. They are now saying thay have to wait three days to update the order (6 days from when the engineer came round)before they even consider dates for a new appointment.  Again DO NOT USE BT~~~,Streatham Hill~~~,2014-01-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I have just sent the following to the BBC:  Well  it's 2014  I have high-speed broadband  and I can't listen to The Archers on iPlayer because it cuts out every few seconds  sometimes coming up with the 'insufficient bandwith' message.  This is for radio  not TV!  I'm sending the same email to BT.  No doubt you'll both blame  each other.  Either way  it's a disgrace in this day and age.Livid of Louth. So now I leave it to you guys - who's going to take the blame  the Beeb or BT?  I'm told I have 40meg download speed  and yet I can't stream a radio programme...???~~~,"Louth, Lincs~~~",2014-01-27~~~,3,~~~,2,3
If you're with Virgin at the moment and tempted to switch to BT because Virgin don't give loyalty points to long time customers  pls don't. You'll end up wishing you're still with Virgin. Internet's so slow  programs don't appear on its TV guide. Can't wait for my contract to end.~~~,london~~~,2014-01-24~~~,~~~,2,~~~,~~~
In a world where Broadband and telephones are just about essential BT cannot allocate an engineer to fix a fault IN THEIR TELEPHONE EXCHANGE in less than a week. We have no useable telephone and no broadband and the earliest they can fix it is January 28th. Perhaps if they took customer service seriously they'd reflect on this employ more engineers and maybe reduce the pay of executives by a small proportion to fund this - the outgoing chief  Ian Livingston  was paid £18.5 million (yes million) last year. An extra engineer or several on £30K or so would hardly dent his pay.~~~,Somerset~~~,2014-01-24~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are a deceitful bunch - I signed up to an 18 month contract with a fixed price of £16 per month. After just 3 months they increased the price from my direct debit. I queried this and was told they were entirely at liberty to do so. If you look at any of their current advertsing it all states fixed prices for the term fo the contract - and dont even try and look at their T&Cs - thousands of pages of them. Just dont ever trust them.~~~,Devon~~~,2014-01-23~~~,1,1,3,3
I ordered my broadband and telephone line on 2nd Jan and was given a date of 21st Jan for installation between 8am to 1pm.Took day of work especailly for this waited and waited until about 2pm an engineer phones as say that he can not fit the telephone toady because of some issues with my previous telephone.Phoned BT and the call centres are aboard the people working there dont have a clue on what customer service is.Had to re schedule the appointment which was given 10 days time.BT are the worst company for customer service.So i cancelled my package with them and i am looking else where.AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS THEY ARE A BUNCH OF TWATS!!!!~~~,BIRMINGHAM~~~,2014-01-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I moved from Virgin thankfully to BT (I used to call virgin and ask them for permission to use broadband it was so bad). BT performance has been on the button  no stupid capping  price is lower  I gave 5 to customer service  I have not used them at all in 11 months. so BT have a thumbs up from me  I gave virgin hell they were so bad !!~~~,stevenage~~~,2014-01-19~~~,5,5,5,5
Wow I never knew how bad BT were until I tried to contact them.  BT are a communications provider.....Right? So why is it impossible to communicate with them?  I spent a full day from 9 am to 7.45 pm trying to speak to the options team  who are so named no doubt because it's their option whether they feel like picking up the phone!!  I called wanting to discuss my increasing bill and to see if they could match a deal from Talk Talk and eventually someone picked up the phone. I explained that I was being offered the same broadband speed  unlimited  including anytime calls and TV for less than I was being charged by BT for broadband and evening and weekend calls.  The response was that Talk Talk are terrible with nonsense reasons why I shouldn't go to them like they would cut me off if I used over £20 of calls! Really my phone provider would cut me off for using the phone? They said I could have a £5 reduction in my bill but they would take away my evening calls!!! Excuse me? Horrendous and they don't care about customers. They have lost this one permanently. Don't touch with a barge pole.~~~,NI~~~,2014-01-16~~~,2,1,4,4
Just awful in every way. We switched from Virgin and have not stopped regretting it. broadband service was extremely patchy and slow for 4 or 5 months. When an engineer finally came after endless phone calls he told us the initial installation was poor and fixed it. Problems continued and we had a 2nd engineer's visit who told us the first engineer had messed things up. He seems to have done a good job and broadband is now ok but we've been charged £130 for the engineer's visit. I'm now on the phone trying to query it. 20 minutes to get through to the billing dept (in India) who told me another dept deals with payments for engineers' visits. Have now spent another 20 mins waiting to get through to them. The customer service is awful. Call centre has been outsourced and the assistants' grasp of English is not great. Avoid BT at all costs.~~~,London~~~,2014-01-14~~~,1,1,1,1
it is the worst internet connection ever it never loads anything and all it does it flash orange day and night. its alright until you try to search for something on your laptop or mobile and then it just messes up.

We have a holiday home on the isle of Skye. We also have Bt broadband  as this was the only option at the time. We hardly use the Internet  just checking emails or web browsing. Usually use about 1GB a month as download speeds are woeful. So were surprised to get an email from BT yesterday to say we had used 10GB in 10 days  get this  when we were not at the property and the hub is turned off. Thought this would be easily resolved with a call to BT. 1.5 hours on the phone later they will not accept their usage monitor is faulty and want us to upgrade our package!!Do not touch BT with a barge pole. Customer service is hopeless! The call centre is in India which makes it even more difficult to get any sense out of them as it appears the poor folks on the help desk are reading a script.... Which they repeat like a mantra whatever you say.~~~,Isle of Skye~~~,2014-01-12~~~,1,1,1,1
If I could give zero stars  I would for all the above. TERRIBLE customer service - calling up was a mustake  nobody knew who to transfer me to and there was no one person in charge. Was on the phone for a good 1.5 hours. And above all TERRIBLE service. Firstly  they ripped us off and installed normal Internet  not broadband as we paid for ( only knew this when they came to fix our internet the second time round) and then a week later they cancelled our internet for no reason and asked us to pay £200. After another week we found out the it was because somebody else from our building had cancelled it by mistake and not told us. After getting Internet back for a week  it has stopped working again. This is the WORST INTERNET PROVIDER I have used and will never use BT again.~~~,London~~~,2014-01-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
So frustrating. Just opening the pages to write this review nearly made me lose the will. I haven't waited for pages to load like this for about 7 years. I can't stream anymore - is this a strategy to force you onto fibre optics?~~~,central London~~~,2014-01-03~~~,1,2,1,1
Its a rip off. The usage figures are fake and they also classify usage as up AND downloads so in effect a 10gb product is only worth 5gb in reality. Which means you can ONLY USE IT for web browsing and emails NO VIDEO/iplayer/BT Sport nothing or you will go over the daily usage in a few hours. Which means big penalties. google BT usage scam and the net is rife with people being ripped off in this manner. Its shocking they are allowed to get away with it. Customer Service is non existant  or any thats makes sense. Keep well away from the crooks.~~~,Lincs~~~,2014-01-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
By infinity...I wonder what it means to bt.... I've ordered fibre optic package on 27th November..Paid for 1 year advance line rental...I was given 3weeks installation date....on the day of engineer visit v had to stay home coz they said from 1 pm to 6pm slot..waited till 7pm and guess what? No engineer...I've contracted them around 7.10 pm and the lady on the other side (presumably in India)Had no idea...I was put on hold and was on line for 1hr before she said I will check the progress and someone will call u back within 24hrs....Guess what  no one called..but I did receive an email saying ur new installation date is 8th January....no apology  no explanation nothing...I was furious as my children were going back to school before that...The next say I tried to contact them and guess what? I was online for 1hrs and 20 min before I disconnected line...and then I tried again...after long infinity years I gotthrough....Now I need to return the box back...let's see how it goes......over and defo out....~~~,Oxford~~~,2013-12-25~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Maybe I am open of the lucky ones. So far  BT have been BRILLIANT.  Setup was easy  speed is spectacular  100% reliable and well worth the extra pennies. bt+i-Mac is supreme.  Thank-you. Keep it up.~~~,Solihull~~~,2013-12-16~~~,5,5,5,5
For years I have suffered with low connection speeds from AOL. I live in very rural location. After 2 engineer visits and countless inane calls to somewhere in India I was still getting speeds of .56 Mbps at peak times  late afternoon and evening. Eventually I switched to BT unlimited broadband and since that day I have a constant speed of 6.5 Mbps and can now watch iplayer  on demand and youtube with no interruptions at all. The changeover was seamless for Broadband and phone and I would not hesitate to recommend them.~~~,Lower Beeding~~~,2013-12-16~~~,5,5,5,5
I appear to be one of the lucky ones. Excellent speeds through copper wire- more than 16mbs on average. Excellent service  well worth the money.~~~,solihull~~~,2013-12-12~~~,5,~~~,~~~,~~~
"I ordered BT Infinity and telephone and received an ""installation"" date of 10 days later.  I booked a day off for the engineer as the installation was between 8 and 1pm.  The day before I get a text telling me that the date has now changed to a day later!  I now took off another day.The next day  the day my service was originally going to be installed  I received an email telling me that my phone number was now live and my broadband was going to be installed the following day.The next day I sit waiting all morning....The engineer turns up at 1:30pm!  Ok ill let him off...He tries to install the broadband only to discover that there is no phone line!!!  He asked if the engineer had been to install the line...Urm no I thought that you would be doing it....  His reply?  He wasn't qualified to work on ""copper"" wire!!!!! I called BT..... Big mistake.  Indian call centre wasn't my issue  staff that passed me from department to department for almost 2 hours is.  I started the call at 2pm and finished at 4.15!Totally useless.  I tried to log a complaint and after telling them that there is an external problem with their line at the actual box in the street  I was advised that I should go to another BB provider!!!!  Idiots!  It doesn't matter which service provider I go to if the problem is with the BT box outside  I will never get a connection!!! Advice...DO NOT DEAL WITH THESE IDIOTS AND CERTAINLY NOT ON AN 18 MONTH CONTRACT!!!~~~",Yorks~~~,2013-12-12~~~,1,1,1,1
I read so many warnings about BT but stupidly took no notice. DO NOT USE THEM. They are terrible. I signed up for BT Infinity in August 2013. They then for reasons best known to BT  cancelled my order. I only found out after calling to find out where the engineer was on the installation day. It's now 5 months on and I still only have around 1/3rd of promised download speed with ethernet cable. Next to nothing with a wireless connection. Rang sales to cancel but they were just arrogant and refused my request out of hand despite the product not being fit for purpose. I am now have to have yet another conversation with tech service. They are good people but clearly their job is horrendous because of the lacklustre product. Ignore the advertising claims  they misrepresent the actual performance of BT Infinity. Rest assured  I will take note of others comments in future. Just stay away from BT.~~~,West Sussex~~~,2013-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst customer service ever. Been a customer for nearly 30 years and when our router stopped working asked for a new router and was told that we would need to pay for a new one unless we sign up for a new contract. Was not willing to do that as we have been getting the worst download speeds and poor customer service. Decided to sign up with new provider. Customer loyalty means nothing.~~~,Bedford~~~,2013-12-07~~~,1,1,1,1
I switched back to Bt a year ago. I am on Infinity2 which offers up to 76mbps. I get as low as 18. every time I complain my call is put through to India where I am told that they will look into the problem. Their normal response is to send out an engineer. I have now had 4 engineer visits and there is and never has been a problem with my phone. The problem is that I live about 400 yards from my connection box (CAB) and can only expect speeds of up to 26mbps. Until BT is prepared to invest money in their infrastructure instead of TV and European football programmes nothing will change. If your thinking of switching to BT check where your CAB is otherwise your speeds will be slow and BT will not care less.~~~,Worthing~~~,2013-12-07~~~,1,1,1,1

BT Broadband is very slow less than 500Kbps most of the time. The free BT Sport app is useless and to be honest 3G gives quicker speed than I get. I have tried all the test and actions to improve the speed BT suggest and its no better and getting worse. It is £30 per month for unlimited broadband and a complete waste of money  will switch as soon as I can.~~~,Rattigan~~~,2013-11-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Signed up to BT broadband so that I could watch BT sport. What a mistake that was. First they got rid of my unlimited free evening calls even though their customer services told me on two occasions that would not change. Now they expect me to pay extra for the evenings call package. Got all the equipment on time and the service started on time and then the real problems began. The internet connection has a mind of its own. Slows down to 0.03Mbps every few hours. Resetting the home hub restores the speed most of the times but not always. After waiting on the phone for about 30 mins each time  technical help go through diagnostics then tell you to switch off all equipment and restart which resolves the issue for a few hours. How long can you keep resetting the router. Try and make a complaint and you just keep going round in circles. They don't want to help and have no idea what customer service is. Can't wait till the 18 months is over. So many better and cheaper deals out there.~~~,West Yorks~~~,2013-08-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Never get a contract with BT. You will regret it. When I first signed up to BT on an eighteen month contract  I wasn't worried about the length of this contract due to BT’s “Moving Home” service. I remember thinking  “well if I need to move house after a few months  that’s no problem  I’ll just move my BT service with me”. When I did move home  I realised just how wrong I was. I was staying briefly at a friend’s place whilst I was trying to find something new. So I call up BT to try and get my services suspended whilst I find somewhere new. Note I was trying to suspend only my services  not payment  I was happy to keep paying the monthly fee.BT tell me they can’t suspend internet services  and can only block outgoing calls for a fee (of £25  despite the fact that it took them a minute to do). So I had to settle with the thought that the new tenant of my old flat could use a BT router to access heavens knows what on a connection in my name  and only me paying £25 was stopping him from doing the same with the phone line.So when I complained to BT on the phone about this  they informed me that they are unable to suspend a service. I emailed several times  and eventually received one reply which stated that not only would I have to accept any charges for SOMEONE ELSE using my services  but that if someone moved into my old place and set up internet there before I could move my services somewhere else  I would be charged the cancellation fee (of £200)  even though this is something I have no control over and was not attempting to stop or suspend paying my monthly fee.So I complained to the communications ombudsman. It took two months for them to get back to me with an answer. They were polite enough but frankly have no clout whatsoever. They said they couldn’t deal with this as it was a “commercial decision made by BT” (as in something BT is doing? So what exactly can they deal with?). Nor did they make any reference to my complaint at being charged £25 for BT to block outgoing calls from my number. The ombudsman is useless and clearly don’t challenge BT at all. I shouldn’t have been too surprised seeing as how readily BT advertise going to them on the BT website.My advice  no matter how tempting a BT contract may look  DON’T DO IT! There customer service is non-existent and they squeeze money out of for doing (poorly) things they should already be doing.~~~,Hertfordshire~~~,2013-08-23~~~,1,1,2,2
"Would have preferred zero star rating for this company. I am told by the callcentre in India that I should be grateful for download speeds of 0.30 mbops & upload speeds of 0.09 mbops  as I live way out in farmland!!! Oh  and I should be pleased to pay £25 a month for this ""service"" - and by the way  BT gives no guarantee of decent speeds for a WIRELESS connection. Yep  this was the latest in their list of excuses. If BT had the honesty to tell me this mumbo-jumbo when I discussed the contract with them. I would have gone elsewhere.~~~",Aberdeenshire~~~,2013-08-06~~~,1,1,1,1
We have been BT customers forever yet when I terminated the useless unwanted wifi with no signal  BT never consulted me about continuing with our Basic Broadband tel service ...low usage for my disabled brother Vaughan W.

My brother's Emergency Alert Alarm no longer  is connected and that company say they can't connect us up again. ...it is the error of our provider BT.

So disappointed with BT. Decided to change suppliers and go with BT  with reassurances from BT that Infinity would work well. Engineer turned up  very grumpy and rude because he had to change junction box. Couldn't set up  said he was going to the main box to reset everything  never returned. Turned up the next day did the same and disappeared - still no broadband. Rany customer services  job marked as complete by engineer!

We have had BT Broadband for about 10 years.  The first years were pretty good with download speeds in the 3Mbps range.  Then we started to get truncation which would make games laggy and frustrating but we thought  hey  new technologies are on their way and BT is worth supporting.  This past year or so things have gone from bad to worse and my 'hobby' is speaking to polite but powerless call centre staff who tell me that I have no problems. I have dropouts numerous times a day  an IP profile that has fallen to 0.5Mb as a result and numerous visits by Openreach to make the problem go away for a week or two only.  Birstall is a slow spot now it seems but nobody has reduced my £26/month service charge to match.~~~,"Birstall, Yorkshire~~~",2012-06-16~~~,1,1,1,1
