We are stuck with BT although we are unable to get the TV channels that were promised to us.  Their TV department is completely unhelpful.  TV customer service representatives are difficult to understand  offer assistance that makes no sense and don't appear to really listen to what your situation is.  We've had numerous repairmen out to the flat and they can't resolve the problem.  BT says its not their fault so we are stuck paying for channels we can't get.  Don't' sign up until you know for sure you are able to get the service or you'll be stuck like me.~~~,Fulham~~~,2015-08-17~~~,3,1,5,5
Worst customer service I've ever experienced. Spoken to about 9-10 different people regarding the same issue. All claim to 'update' notes online so each member can follow up with the order  but had to discuss same issue over and over again with all staff clueless each time. Unbelievably frustrating. Would move to ANY other provider  however none in our block of flats.Could not be more frustrated or angry. Almost one month since we first placed our order  only to hear one day ago that we have to replace our order due to the incompetence at BT.~~~,Surrey~~~,2015-08-16~~~,1,1,1,1
I have given very low stars for speed and reliability. I would have given no stars if there was an option.  I joined BT in June 2015. I order VDSL1 and had reliable service with no drops and I had the max speed my line could support.  I was over the moon as previous ADSL2 was only supporting 6 meg download. 36 meg ddownload. This lasted only two months and in Aug 2015 the Home Hub 5 kept crashing. It crashed and rebooted every 3 minutes. I called customer service and they reset my line profile. Which means they reduced my noise margins  line attenuation and signal attenuation. This meant I now get speeds of 5 meg. Not only that the Home hub 5 still crashes so nothing has been resolved. I am still trying to communicate with BT India  but I seem to know more about the technicalities that they do.If I get a resolution i might revise this feedback. Let see what happens. The good news is that although im tied into a 12 month contract I have read that we are able to terminate if we are not delivered the speeds promised.~~~,Isle of Wight~~~,2015-08-14~~~,2,2,1,1
I had the BT broadband TV and phone from by for two years as they were charging the highest rate as the contract monthly was £42 per month it never did came less then £54 a month so now I have to move to my new address what happened was that I called the costumer service for cancelation of service they told me I will be charged £100 plus so I had no choice to stay instead of continue agreement they gave me new no new contract which I have to accept but I was not moving from my present property they cut my all lines and started my new contract as I moved into new property they were suppose to give me the Internet line n phone but didnot n have to wait for a month now a few weeks ago I got the line n was happy but today the line of phone n Internet isn't there so I called the costumer  service and they told me it will be fixed after three working days or more by the engeneer but no fix date so I am really unhappy with BT . so I suggest to have other phone line n Internet and waiting when the contract ends I will never keep BT .its not BT it's Bad Treat~~~,Swindon~~~,2015-08-13~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Appalling service. Like so many  we only went with them because my boyfriend wanted BT sport. They have ripped us off every month for the last year. They have LIED to us over and over  changing contractual agreements and pricing for broadband and BT sport it is nearly £50 PER MONTH! We have no home phone and the BT sport has not been used since we moved house 4 months ago and yet every month our bill goes up and up. They refuse to offer a refund and an explanation. CANNOT WAIT TO SWITCH NEXT MONTH.~~~,North West~~~,2015-08-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Been trying to place order with BT broadband for the last week now and every time at the last bit of the order procedure it comes up with a screen saying Technical Error Ref #CON-0067. I found the bt brodband deal through site topcashback  a site I have used numerous times and has worked well. After a week of contacting BT not a single member of any customer services  sales or 'Easy Assist' team was able to help me complete my order. None of them could even explain what the error code meant and if it was ever going to be fixed. Useless company with useless customer services.~~~,London~~~,2015-08-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Speed rarely reaches 1mb  if more than one person uses the internet it crawls. Engineers have been out and confirm a problem with BT's line locally but has never been fixed. Over £30/month and can't even play a youtube video at peak times? AVOID BT. They LIe.~~~,Cornwall~~~,2015-08-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Thieves! Started to charge me for a service I never asked for. I complained they said they would refund and passed me on to someone else. Then was told it couldn't be refunded. Will be pursuing this further. Fortunately my contract is almost up so will be leaving. Also is very difficult to get through  probably due to all the other people complaining about being ripped off.~~~,Reading~~~,2015-08-12~~~,1,1,1,2

Unfortunately I have the displeasure of dealing with BT in my personal and working life - albeit different arms of the same incompetent beast.In <4 months of being in what essentially is a BT only area the issues I have experienced are:- had my broadband date moved back numerous times (over 6 weeks from the initial install date) without reason.- been charged for the telephone line (which I HAVE to take) during that period yet it fulfilled no purpose.- had broadband dropouts on a regular basis despite being a few hundred yards from a BT exchange.- had a BT home hub failure.- spent 10+ hours on the phone to BT chasing them when they do not call back regarding an issue.- had BT take my broadband from operational to inoperable whilst making my TV services 'live'. They 'pulled out the stops' and got it back up 4 days later.-provided an overall pathetic service. The only hopeful piece I can state is that their offshore call centre employs very polite people - if not very competent ones. On top of this their staff don't listen and I have very little feeling that their services will improve at all. Awful company  awful personnel underpinning an atrocious service.~~~,"Kent, UK~~~",2015-08-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful. Absolutely awful. Contrasting 'advice'  huge call queues  one of the worst customer services i have ever had. I would rather give my money to a charity and have no internet than fund these clowns.~~~,Scotland~~~,2015-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are a terrible service provider.SLOW SPEEDS  CONSTANT DROPS  TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT.They LIE. They don't fix your problem.They lie about sending engineers.They are a joke and a disgrace.THEY    ARE    A    JOKE~~~,woking~~~,2015-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is a terrible phone and internet provider. The overall service is poor.Internet speed slow  customer support is awful. In my case I have had no phone line for 6 weeks and my internet connection is lucky to last an hour at a time before dropping. THE MAIN PROBLEM is that when you call for support  you get put through to an organisation that is impossible to communicate to. THEY DONT fix your problem and LIE that they will send engineers. If the engineers come they DONT DO THEIR JOB. BT ARE THE WORST. Go to virgin  sky or plus net. This review site didn't give me the option to leave a star based rated  but If it did I would give them the highest possible negative rated possible.BT are finished.~~~,Surrey~~~,2015-08-11~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
My broadband speed is 0.13Mbps and keeps dropping out.   also heavy packet loss.   The local engineers (openreach) know where the issues are  however there has to be a long  totally pointless and useless conversation with BT everytime before they'll ever get round to sending an engineer out.   Overall the support and efficiency of the BT customer service is truly awful~~~,Salisbury~~~,2015-08-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Beware of this company  they don't honour their offers.. I switched from TalkTalk to BT in August 2015 after signing up with then on 20th June 2015.  The package was for b/b and w/e calls + bt sport free for the duration of the 12 month contract. Now that the football season is here I tried to activate the sport on my pc but nothing happened. After making several calls to BT and spoken to their chat line I have been told that the deal changed and I now have to pay £5.00 extra per month for the something which was a free gift. I just got thru talking to a very nasty c/s dept who would not pass me over to a manager or supervisor  had the cheek to ask why I had only just noticed the service was missing and said that the deals were changed in July.  I am guessing that the internet offer was only there to get the business. Disgrace all round~~~,Ormskirk / West Lancashire~~~,2015-08-09~~~,1,1,4,3
Worst experience ever with a company. They sell themselves are the premium option in the broadband market. This is far from the truth. They're over a month late with my order and keep wasting my time with missed appointments and excuses. They've now had the audacity to bill me for service which isn't even connected and say I must pay the bill and be refunded the following month. They claim the order has become 'stuck' and must be re-ordered. Avoid at all costs.~~~,Durham~~~,2015-08-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Have been with BT 7 Years now ADSL and fiber broadband.Contract up for renewal this December.Moving to wightfiber  had enough of BT'S poor customer support and lack of knowledge~~~,Isle of Wight~~~,2015-08-06~~~,1,1,1,1
"Been a BT customer for a number of years and currently have BT Infinity. I moved from Eclipse who for me were the best but at that stage didn't kprovide fibre. Fortunately I have had few problems with BT  if I did I would have gone elsewhere. My gripes:I upgraded to super fast fibre last year  apart from a slight increase in upload speed I did not notice any difference. Numerous online tests followed until I discovered that BT cannot provide superfast fibre in my area. When I spoke to customer services it was ""my fault"" as I did not formalise a complaint.  In my view BT don't take care of their own customers - you will wait between 30 minutes to get through to customer services. Horrendous.llloll BT won't negotiate at renewal  fantastic offers for new customers but unlike competitors and for the rest of us no incentive to remain. I was offered a £1.15 discount on broadband on the basis I had paid a whole year for a service BT couldn't provide.  I've renewed again this year to allow me to find a reliable ISP that takes care of its customers - if there is one out there.~~~",Croydon~~~,2015-08-03~~~,3,1,3,4
Dreadful  just dreadful. I was told I could upgrade to faster broadband - so signed up for it. On the (delayed) activation day the service did not work. I waited all day for it to activate  it didn't. Ended up on the phone to India for an hour - they arranged for an engineer to visit 3 days later.The engineer arrived one hour early - luckily my son was in  I wasn't.The engineer confirmed that faster broadband was not available - I am apparently too far away from the exchange (3 miles) and I will NEVER be able to receive faster broadband. I asked him if he could reactivate my old BT broadband - he said 'No'. Apparently my 'old protocols had been wiped  by BT  in the Exchange'. He then told me I (yes  that's right  me!) needed to contact BT - I thought I was already speaking to BT! Apparently not - I was speaking to an engineer from BT Openreach...and that's different to BT Retail. So I call BT Retail - speak to 2 people in India who can't help me  then 2 in the UK - one of whom can help me (this call takes 1 hour 20 minutes). The BT UK Agent can 'help me' by 'passing on a request to reactivate my old service' - but I'll have to wait 5 working days (a week!) for them to put right what they turned off because they couldn't deliver the service I was sold and didn't even check it first!I will be without broadband for at least 2 weeks in total thanks to BT misselling a service  cutting off my old service and putting me back in a queue to wait whilst they fox what should never have been broken in the first place.Oh  and I've complained too but I've been told that I'll have to wait 18 days for a response because they are 'very busy right now' - sounds like that's a major signal that your service is utterly crap  BT.Appalling.~~~,Dunblane~~~,2015-08-03~~~,1,1,1,1

Poor  poor service. I have called BT on three occasions (each lasting well over an hour while they pass me from person to person)to help me with my broadband connection constantly dropping out. They must be reading from a script as they in no way attempt to answer any of the problems I have. They refused to upgrade my hub to a hub5 while they offer new customers  welcome vouchers to the tune of £125 while they treat current customers like second class citizens. I have just moved to Sky where the service and attitude is more courteous and informative. BT - your service needs to improve (I was left on hold for 25mins!). No-one appears to have any influence on making decisions - they just pass you on. A dreadful broadband service and customer service. Glad I moved on!~~~,Planet Earth~~~,2015-08-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Really bad service  should be called  Bollywood Telecom  the people you get through to have not got a clue  spent four hours on the phone so far  two hours in chat rooms  got nowhere  they can not even sort out my board band  upgrade  over charged for service that was supposed to be free  can I get refund no  they take your money and you try getting it back  the actual line service works well  just a shame no one knows how to sell an upgrade  and sort out over charging ~~~,wolverhampton~~~,2015-07-31~~~,1,1,1,1
I wouldn't NEVER recommend using BT broadband to anyone! Wanted to change mine from Orange to BT  phoned up and they told me they would be able to cancel my live box contract. The Bt hub arrived but didn't connect so phoned up and they said an engineer would be able to come out  who never turned up! Also turns out they never cancelled our current orange box and we are still in the same position we started in! BT ARE USELESS!!!!~~~,Southampton~~~,2015-07-30~~~,1,1,1,1

"I had BT Broadband (9meg) for two years and have to say overall I was generally pleased with it.  I consistently received the promised speed and the reliability was very good (think it went off once for an hour in the two years).   As soon as infinity was available in my area I 'upgraded'.  How I wish I hadn't!!  I've had 'super fast' supposedly 35Mbps broadband now for 4 months  of which it's only really been usable for about one month in total. I very regularly experience speed drops  on average a drop of 90% of my connection speed to < 1mbps and I'd saymy average speed is probably lower than I had on their 9Mbps connection.  I've lost count of the number of times I've called BT and had callbacks scheduled for them to return my calls to on several occasions not receive said call back. Everytime you call you have to go through the same 20 questions  reboot your router etc. which is infuriating (I've a degree in computer science and I'm a software developer so I have a pretty good understanding of how it should work) but they still make you go through their script and refuse to escalate you to someone you can actually talk too instead of playing 21 questions.After around 20 calls to them I finally got them to arrange an engineers visit to my house for a set date/timeslot and ensured I wasin  they didn't turn up!  When I enquired where the engineer was I was told the job had been assigned to an engineer who wasn'tqualified to do the job so he'd rejected it but I'd not been notified so had been sat in waiting for nothing.  Another engineerwas scheduled to come the following day.  This time he did turn up and I have to say was fantastic! He was with me for around 3 hours and we talked in length about it and he told me he knew there was nothing wrong with my connection and that it was a faultat BT's end (a throughput issue) which he couldn't do anything about (the engineers are part of openreach who aren't actually the same company as theBT who supply the service!).  He ran all the diagnostics he could and then phoned BT again on my behalf to explain everythingand we both started laughing when he was made to perform the same basic tasks as I was each time I phoned. ""have you rebooted therouter""  ""can you try it on a cable"" etc  etc.  What a joke - they don't even trust the engineers they send out to know what they'reon about. After many many more calls between myself and BT there's still be no real resolution or explanation from BT themselves or anyform of compensation for not being able to use the service I've been paying for for months! I've had other issues too such as certain pages refusing to load until you refresh several times  something I discovered many people across the country were havingon the BT customer forums yet again BT refuse to acknowledge a problem.  I now find myself experiencing issues that preventme being able to use the service I'm paying for and I really cannot be bothered to call them to report them as I have no faithwhatsoever in their 'technical' support and don't want to go through the pain and arguments with their first line 'technicians'to get nowhere.  I have to say if I had any other options in my area I wouldn't be with BT!~~~",Derbyshire~~~,2015-07-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Overall installation was quick and painless. The speed was a great improvement over our old provider and the HH5 performed reasonably well.  However after the first 8 months we have noticed a considerable drop in reliability in our connection to the HH5  we have normally 3 mobiles and 2 pc's connected at once and the router will flat out stop responding for a good few minutes. Not sure if it is just our device or what  but I have read that this is a problem that happens to this version of the home hub.~~~,Northampton~~~,2015-07-27~~~,3,4,4,1
"BT infinity. thats what this contract seems like and so does the telephone calls of complaint I've tried to make - infinity. I have buffering on all you tube/music etc. connection drops out every few minutes. This is on a new laptop with wifi. I can only EVER get through to someone in India who doesn't seem to understand English  talks over you when you try to explain that ""No we tried that yesterday and the day before and the day before that and all last week and I am not prepared to do the same things YET AGAIN"" was offered an engineer at £125. NO I dont want to pay for someone to come and check why I am not getting what I am paying for on my monthly contract. I am paying for it to work  if it doesnt work  I am not paying to find out why it doesnt work. they should be doing that.~~~",nottinghamshire~~~,2015-07-27~~~,1,1,1,1
My broadband has been fine only issues are with the TV package.Absolutely horrendous customer service  after them overcharging my account by £70.04 they withheld my money and said they would take it off my bills each month until it was paid back  every month i had to ring to complain as they continued to take money from me  this has went on for 4 months. At every phone call trying to speak to so called managers with unpronounceable names  getting nowhere was very frustrating  also when asking questions and explaining my frustration to be given a number of long silences with no answers adding to my frustration  i think is an appalling way to treat a customer  when asking for a reference number for which i have many off them now after every phone call  he tried to give me a digit less  so when he heard me counting the digits he then repeated the number giving me an extra digit  knowing his mistake. I cannot wait to be out of my contract with them and will not be using them again.~~~,burnopfield~~~,2015-07-27~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
BT was a nightmare and the services I received was poorly. The speed was so variable and quite often I could not read newspapers online because of weak internet speed. When I have had broadband issues it was unbelieveable how BT handled my complaints from India. It was terrible. I noticed that BT people over the phone were telling different things about the problem and it was not innocious mistakes they were rather lies about when BT will resolve the problem or what was the problem. BT has ruined my work as I was working from home and I have been hugely dependent on e-mails which did not work with BT.I warn you be careful about BT and do not waste your time BT look something else....I lost quite few years with BT and paid so much. I wish I have never have had this unprofessional services from BT. I feel spry for those Indian agents on the other end of the phone line who were forced to lie about the services they offer.... Shame on BT!~~~,Reading~~~,2015-07-24~~~,2,1,2,2
I understand all the gripes posted on this site as I have experienced some of them  but the most aggravating instance is a phone call from India at 1.am in the morning asking my wife if I was available  after all the fuss and stumbling out to the phone from a warm comfortable bed  when she remarked on this unwelcome phone call  he just put the phone down without any explanation why he had called or a sorry or kiss my ass or anything.

Broadband has never worked the engineer who installed my brand new line left with no working system not knowing why...... BT customer services are a joke - never actually return phone calls - though I have had mysterious silent mobile answer phone messages with no associated phone call- I'm sick of repeating myself and I'm sick of being spoken to like an idiot as if I can't plug in a bleeding hub correctly . They have now cleared my 'fault ' on the online fault tracker ..... I wish ! It all seems like they are cooking their figures for Ofcom ! The public are not that stupid ! I'm so close to just returning the hub etc and telling them to shove their broadband .......if you're thinking of using BT all I can say is DONT!!~~~,Caerphilly~~~,2015-07-23~~~,1,1,1,1
BT broadband is terrible the connection speed is poor at best and cannot stream anything without buffering on multiple occasions  even though advertised as super fast and no buffering. The service is poor and would recommend any broadband service except BT~~~,Engalnd~~~,2015-07-19~~~,1,1,1,1
I was very happy with my BT package until I was talked into upgrading to fibre optic earlier this year. The promise of substantially better speeds for little additional cost was too hard to refuse......something I now wish I could take back. For several months the connection has been little better than standard broadband but for much of the time I found myself completely without. I've waited days for line tests  had a replacement hub  and promises of a satisfactory speed  and all whilst I was still paying BT the full monthly fee. After I questioned my payments for a service I was not getting I was promptly promised compensation which would be handled by the BT billing department. On receipt of my latest bill I was disappointed to see no discount or refund had been applied. I'd also had no further contact from BT on the matter. I phoned BT to find out why I'd received no compensation as per their promise and  after an hour on the phone to 4 different people  was told that refunds and compensation were only given if there had been a total loss of service. To say I was furious is an understatement.Although the download and upload speeds have now improved the connection constantly drops out  and streams  posts and data are almost always struggling to refresh. I can put up with faults and loss of service provided they are being dealt with and I can see progress. However  why the hell BT expect me to continue to pay for this is downright theft. But worst of all is being lied to when I was ASSURED compensation. If I was to lie to clients in my position I would swiftly find myself looking for alternative employment. It seems I'm forced to sit out my contract with BT before I give an alternative supplier a try.Horrendous experience.~~~,Bideford~~~,2015-07-19~~~,1,1,3,1
