Pay for a 75Mb connection  usually receive in the region of 35Mb. The customer service is shockingly awful  they don't care in the slightest so don't expect them to help you. We were stunted with an engineer bill of £130 as well  for an issue that even the engineer told us was BT's fault and not our own  an oversight by the original engineer in the set up cost us in the long term.  On top of this issues like losing Broadband service for a week at a time (with no apparent fault on their end)  and over a month waiting time to get set up initially make this all in all a great practice in wasting money and time.~~~,Plymouth~~~,2015-02-23~~~,1,1,2,1
Overall for several months I have found the BT broadband and TV service to be very poor the customer service to be polite has been an absolute shambles.For over three months we have had erratic broadband service with frequent outages; the BT Vision has not worked at all for weeks. I have Open Reach technicians send hours here  the last one diagnosed a fault underground in December but as at the 22nd February it is still not resolved. The good news is that we have a new cable on our property connection the distribution box under the footpath outside my house which comes on to my property via a new trench dug through my garden and drive but the bad news is that it ends in 3 Metres of loose unconnected cable lying on my drive - a chocolate teapot at least have some use since we could eat it...The worst part of BT's (total lack of customer service) is having to deal with the BT call centres which seem to be in India. The people there are doing there best to provide service but the whole BT customer service system when there is an ongoing fault is in a state of absolute shambles. I have had dozens of discussions with the call centres  most of which result in total frustration on my part since the call centre folks are only given part of story by BT Open Reach folks which has resulted in hours of wasted time on calls and call backs.My requests to speak to someone in the UK who is dealing directly with resolving our Broadband/TV service meet with a complete blank refusal. I ask to escalate my but all I get is someone else repeating the same half true stories and then being met with continued unfulfilled promises as to when my service problems will be resolved.~~~,"Chorley, Lancashire~~~",2015-02-23~~~,1,1,2,1
My experience with BT has got to be the worst experience I have ever  ever had as a consumer and I strongly recommend others steer well clear. 6 weeks  over 30 phone calls to BT  several hours on hold  40 occasions of being misadvised  stood up by 3 x engineers  £121 and still no broadband.~~~,Aylesbury~~~,2015-02-23~~~,1,1,1,1
I had Virgin Media for 2 years and I only had an issue once. A technician was sent immediately to fix it. I've had BT for 6 months and I have issues on a monthly basis  which I'm left to myself to solve. I've had to look up answers to questions online  which the phone support was not able to provide me with. I strongly recommend Virgin over BT!~~~,Cambridge~~~,2015-02-23~~~,1,1,5,2

Firstly disappointed to find out that because we have moved into a new build estate that BT are our only option so we compared prices and the unlimited Infinity 1 package seemed like a pretty good deal.  We signed up but there was a problem. First issue was that Openreach had to go out and install the line and BT would call back with and update 3 days later.  They did call back but the voicemail was that another update would be forthcoming in 3 days time. So I waited and 3 days later another update was due 3 days later.  Another three days and the voicemail said that the explanation would be provided in another five days time. Now so far I've not been too upset as BT had kept to their estimated callbacks and as it's a newbuild I had to expect some hiccoughs. The update call with the 'reason' I got was that openreach are unable to provide the service as there is no phoneline!  I knew this because I am asking them to install the flamin' line! 'We are sorry Sir but we have cancelled your order'.   At this point knowing BT are my only option and they cannot provide the service at all with no explanation is ridiculous! I have asked for the matter to be escalated but I doubt this will make any difference. So we are now faced with moving into a nice new house today that won't have a phone line or broadband indefinitely. No I would not recommend them but when they control the monopoly of lines I wish there was at least another ISP to try! But there isn't.~~~,"Corby, Northamptonshire~~~",2015-02-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful service I had to phone 4 times to stop them double billing me and then they put me on the wrong tariff.Broadband speed nowhere near what they advertised and regularly stalls. Looking to change my provider as soon as.~~~,Scotland~~~,2015-02-20~~~,1,1,1,1
All we wanted was a simple switch which required a new hub and a youview box and an engineer to conection so in order here's what happened 1) the hub was delivered to our address but addressed to my mum who died in 2008 and should not  e on the account2) the engineer went to our old address where we haven't lived for 7yr3) billed us for a youview box that was with the engineer who went to our old address 4) after dealing with their Bangalore call centre and being promised a call back twice funny never happened NOW BYE BT HELLO SKY they have now also lost my dad and brothers as customers as delivering items addressed to my mum has so badly upset us we are all going g with divergent providers~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2015-02-20~~~,1,1,2,1
"Had BT Infinity for 2 years and the speed has been well below normal broadband speed. After numerous hours calling there useless customers service and technical support they failed to resolve the problem but still charged the higher price for this so called ""superfast' Infinity. I overheard there engineer on the phone asking the exchange to remove the 'cap'  so they do actually control the speed. I have now moved to EE and not only is the speed satisfactory but its also much cheaper.~~~",Sutton Coldfield~~~,2015-02-19~~~,1,1,1,2

Daylight robbery.  We have moved  we asked BT to keep the port open as we were looking to take one BT infinity (We both work from home and need those speeds)  the same package as the originals home owners (my parents).  This was promised and they agreed the sale.  The day came  no engineer turned up and after US calling BT  we were told the port had been closed and capacity sold to someone else!!!  Leaving us without Broadband infinity until 18th March.  With no apology or admittance of fault.  Then having to spend a total amount of 5 hours to get dialup set up for next week.Which is pointless for work.  Absolutely the worst service I have EVER had from a company.~~~,Berkshire~~~,2015-02-18~~~,1,1,1,1

will never use bt again. signed up for bt infinity a few years ago via fibre optic and all was well  then soon after the 2 year contract ran out the broad band speed got slower and slower made numerous calls to the technical department and both I and they  had problems understanding each other due to the language difficulties they always carry out the same tests that take 10 to 15 minutes a time and always say that their systems show that we are getting 70mb down load speed  try to explain to them that we are often getting less than 1mb and they just put up defensive walls and refuse to listen they also seemed surprised that i refused to go out and but a lead to connect my computor to the hub so that they could test this  tried to explain that it was their hub and i wanted an engineer to come out and test it and they refused. spoke with one young lady who to be fair was very helpful and she got us to press the reset button on the rear of the hub that sorted the problem in the short term but we are having to press the reset button 2 or 3 times a day to get a decent down load speed. finally to day asked to speak with customer services uk to speak about cancelling my contract with them as they seemed incapable of resolving the problem and the young lad agreed that it sounded like and old hub that wasn't up to the job and that i needed an upgrade and then wanted to charge me for a replacement hub tried to explain that i pay them for a service which they are not providing and that the hub is theirs and not mine and that maybe they would like to replace the hub as part of the service that i pay for and he said that he would speak with his manager and call me back  i have heard nothing from them since and so have spent the rest of the afternoon speaking to other suppliers and will dropping bt as soon a possible~~~,suffolk~~~,2015-02-16~~~,1,1,1,1
"Firstly  service  in one word  is PATHETIC. BT took a sweet 20 days to put up the line. And the line did not work! They took another 7 days to fix the problem. The speed was excellent. It worked without problems for exactly 2 weeks. After that  the disruptions began. The modem would stop working every 15 minutes to two hours  for 15 seconds to 3 minutes  at random. This basically means that you cannot stream movies without having interruptions at random. You cannot VPN into office without having to go through the trouble of reconnecting at random intervals.  Then comes customer support. Support folks are mostly a friendly lot with intentions to help. Though the intentions rarely translates to actual proper  satisfying resolutions. I took the connection because of the speed and unlimited service  but little did I know that the advertisement not mentioning an uninterrupted service meant that the service would be as pathetic as it is! I would rather go for lesser speed with download limits than continue with such a horrible service  but unfortunately  they want me to pay a discontinuation fee of some sort. I think I might take this to court since there are many ongoing  registered complaints regarding this. The saddest part is that this is my first experience in the UK  and I am thoroughly disappointed because the so-called ""Third world nation"" that I come from  offers much better service  reliability  customer service! So much for the British experience.. PS: No nationality based offense meant. But the BT service so far  is what it is.~~~",Cambridge~~~,2015-02-16~~~,~~~,~~~,3,~~~
Don't use BT! Their custom service is appauling. Incompetant  rude and seriously unhelpful. They are vastly over priced and everything is added on as extras meaning you end up paying even more than you thought to get the same service as elsewhere. Their fibre optic broadband is only fine if you are plugged in  the wireless drops out constantly and the router has to restart all the time causing no end of trouble. Would leave now if I wasn't tied into a contract. Never using BT again!~~~,Canterbury~~~,2015-02-16~~~,1,1,3,1
Signed up to a phone  broadband tv & sport pack. Less than £30 a month. Equipment delivery and engineer were both early. BT Wifi & BT Sport apps are great extras. I had a fault which was fixed within a week including engineer visit at no charge. Even the infamous BT Indian call centre called as promised. Would recommend to anyone~~~,Barrow~~~,2015-02-15~~~,5,5,5,5
Sad to say BT are very poor. I eventually changed to sky.  I had broadband and phone with BT @ £43.00 a month. Speeds were 0.8 download and 0.2 upload but at weekends we often got zero. I concur with other posters that customer service was useless and even total lies. I threatened to take them to court through breach of terms and conditions and left BT on that basis.  Now on Sky broadband on exact same copper wire and get 3.8 download and 0.8 upload. Broadband is quite stable also.  The problem lies with BT.~~~,Leeds~~~,2015-02-13~~~,1,1,1,1

When we had Ifinity2 upgrade an ex Railway guy who had worked for BT for 6 weeks did install...did not understand how to reconnect extension wiring to new master linejack..ha ha ha..

"I've been a longstanding BT customer using both phone and broadband  had issues with an old router resolved (router started making weird noises but still worked  called BT and they sent out a new one sharpish). Had various packages and upgrades over the years  though it is very difficult to get a cheaper package  I have to ""leave"" BT and then sign up again which is annoying.  Use broadband for streaming TV  regular surfing  speeds are good except streaming at peak times is not possible.  Also use the openzone Wifi when out and about which is very handy.  As long as I can get a good deal I will keep using them.~~~",Aberdeenshire~~~,2015-02-12~~~,4,3,3,5
Just moved from BT to SKY due to the following; 1. Horrendous performance including multiple drop - outs  slowwwwww speeds  weird loss of Internet during heavy rain (BT accused me of imagining this)  and did I mention the (many many many) drop - outs?  2. Customer 'service' is a joke. Call centres in India where the poor souls are clearly reading from a script and have zero ability to actually listen to what you're saying far less actually offer a helpful solution. And they never  ever  EVER ring you back after they tell you they will. Ever.  3. Faulty hub. And again. And again. And again. 4. I think BT are bloated  arrogant and complacent and they don't deserve my hard earned cash. Sky on the other hand have been wonderful and THEIR Indian call centre has staff who actually are allowed to think for themselves. Also they make you feel like they appreciate that you've  chosen them and want to make you happy. Hooray!~~~,Ayrshire~~~,2015-02-12~~~,1,1,1,1
I live in the country  so my internet will always be slow. But my exsperence with Bt has been awful. Lost my phone line for just under a month. It made my internet even worse. After they fixed it I had charges I never made. Dealing with customer service was the worse part of it all. No one speaks English good and it's very difficult when you have a problem and they will not say sorry for the bad service. I had to fight for any compensation and its was almost not worth the effort. Can wait for my contact to finish. Think I might just leave early.~~~,Chipping Campden ~~~,2015-02-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Our community group as been with BT for 5 years now  and have recently just upgraded to 38Mb fibre. On the old ADSL  we had a wireless speed of 18Mb and now have a wireless speed of 36Mb on fibre. The only contact I have had with them  was when we phoned to upgrade.  Dealt with sincere courtesy and everything which was promised was promised.  The engineer turned up this week between the promised times and within 30 minutes we were upgraded. I do not know what they are like when you have problems  as we have not (touch wood) had any with them. Over our 5 years experience  I can recommend.~~~,Rochdale~~~,2015-02-11~~~,5,5,5,5
"My Daughter ordered this system on line  having been lured by the provision of the free BT sports on TV. Other than that she had been happy with her previous ISP. Talk Talk.I too ordered the same system a day or so apart. (I live a 3 minute walk away)To cut a very long story short: upon connection it soon become apparent that my daughter could not get BT sport on TV. Over the next 7/10 days we spoke to BT customer service (An appalling service) about this problem. Here is a rough log of calls. 1. Order management office Cardiff (some of the information I was given here was either totally incorrect or misleading  but there was no apology nor solution provided.2. An advisor in Belfast (Ditto above)3. An English speaking lady Melanie in the UK4. Shefali India (promised to call back the next day) and of course that didn't happen even though I gave her my mobile number and it was connected with 5 bars all day5. Yokes India. This gentlemen was down right rude. So I asked to speak to his Manager ..?6. Chanda India ( The manager) I may as well have been talking to myself) totally inept7. Erin (UK) I suspect Liverpool area. At last a young lady who recognised that she was talking to a Customer. ""I really do care about my customers"" she bravely and genuinely stated. I pointed out respectfully that if she did it would be better to leave BT and find an organisation that would compliment her natural talents and beliefs. My simple request was this: wether BT sport on TV is free or not. My daughter ordered the system BECAUSE that was the main lure. It hasn't been supplied and no date for when it could be was given. On that basis it is only fair for her to be able to cancel the service and receive a full refund without charges. BT say that because their confusing online order system caught her out  tough luck. If she cancels now not only will there be no refund  on the contrary she will have to pay a cancellation charge. Only a monstrous  outsized  disorganised poorly resourced Dinosaur like BT could treat their Customers like this and get away with it because they simply DON'T care. I will never  ever.....use this despicable organisation again for a packaged internet TV or phone provision  even though I have recently ordered the same at the same system. I will have to suffer their disgustingly poor customers care for 12 months as will my daughter (even though she has not received what she sincerely believed she'd ordered)Then it's Goodbye  Alvida and good riddance .  If you want a good standard of customer care avoid BT or use them at you Peril. They as far away from British as the planet Pluto!!!~~~",Essex~~~,2015-02-11~~~,1,1,3,3
If there was a choice to put NO stars I would.  What a rip-off of a company!  They have a reputable name so you expect a lot from them but the customer service IS USELESS and in INDIA.  The customer services team seem to struggle at times to understand and process English.  Thankfully I left them last year and cleared up everything  however I considered continuing my contract with then when I moved so gave them my forwarding address etc.  Today nearly 6 months later I receive an email from a debt collection agency saying I owe them £35!!!  I ring them up only to be told I did not give them my forwarding address so obviously they used this agency to trace me and now I have to pay them 25% fee on top of what they say I owe them!! I am LIVID.  I absolutely abhor this company!!~~~,england~~~,2015-02-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Avoid at all costs. Connection is poor and live in an area surround by fibre optic yet our house plus 6 others seem to have been missed out even though you can't get much closer to the main hub yet BT won't connect us otherwise i'd be with Virgin. Got sent a non functioning hub and after spending a week phoning India repeating and jumping through hoops to get this sorted the only offer given to me was to send an engineer and be charged £129.99 because they sent equipment that didn't work. Then the engineer didn't turn up and had to book more time off work for another to be sent. They will scam you unless you go for there infinity if they feel like connecting your area up that is  Avoid  Avoid and Avoid. Also Ombudsman doesn't care because they were paid off with buying up all the contracts. Monopoly wins and average consumer gets ripped off. Parents use sky and they are 10 times better  think anyone else is better and until people stop using BT and the government sell the contracts out fairly this won't change.~~~,Bournemouth~~~,2015-02-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Overpriced service  which whilst it has been reliable in the main  since organising a switch over to another provider has become un-usable  dropping constantly  very low ping times. Biggest gripe with BT is the cost  hugely expensive service  with no offers to keep pace and be competitive if you are already a user. Thus almost forcing you to move providers  stupid business strategy  now moving for a like for like deal that is a quarter of the cost! Line dropping is a big feature and always has been  annoying when watching BBC iPlayer or doing streaming.....~~~,Horsham~~~,2015-02-09~~~,1,2,1,1
Poor service yet again from BT. I wonder whether any of their departments communicate.. I have TV broadband and phone with BT... I recently became eligible for Netflix free as part of my package.. Signed up for it... I enquired as to me having Netflix in the past and cancelling my subscription would be a problem as its the same email address I use now... I was told no problem... And yet on setting up my new box which took 25 minutes   only to discover Netflix not working... I then phoned BT only to spend a further forty minutes of my time talking to asia  only to then be told oh the department we need is closed ... I will have to call you tomorrow... Apparently I should of received an email from another department... Of course  standard with BT... Said email has not been sent... Every time I use BT for any sort of upgrade it is never straightforward or simple.. And always involves being pushed from pillar to post and taken forever to be resolved....I have come to accept that this poor service is just the norm from BT... And that yes of course most definitely means no not possible...i am infuriated by their incapapabilities~~~,sittingbourne~~~,2015-02-08~~~,1,1,3,3

5 weeks and still waiting for the smooth migration from aol over to bt...  worsed mistake ever!!!! Left with no internet what so ever not even old trusty aol..Placed order over five weeks ago only to find out my order had failed not once  not twice  but three times for what ever reason  they gave me so many complicated reasons as to why an order can fai...(failed because sombody didn't click the mouse properly)..  I was promised a smooth migration as they put it with no loss of Internet connection it would just switch over at midnight... The change over day has arrived and I guess I am paying from today's date but I have no router no TV set top box or anything els for that matter... I even recived a tx message saying my router would be with me yesterday... Still nothing worsed company ever...  Don't bother with bt the lame excuses have been almost entertaining..

Well here I am as February starts tomorrow  phones working  though no answer phone or caller ID  televisions just connected today but no BT sport!!  internets ok  but half of the speed quoted!! And still I wait for my old number to return   then and then only will BT even consider the days taken off with no engineer  still not sorted out in 2 months and bills that don't tally to what I've had??!!  and I know it's a free phone number  but they're getting paid to speak to me  who's going to reimburse me with the 12 hours (so far) I've spent on the phone because they can't sort a straight forward order out.~~~,North Yorkshire ~~~,2015-01-30~~~,2,1,3,3
Decided to join BT Infinity in May 2014 as it apparently was the best  fastest broadband on the market.Since May  we've probably made over 20 calls a MONTH to complain about our terrible service. Calls will usually last around 1hr - 3hrs  this is fine if you don't have dinner to cook  places to be and lives to live but sadly  we do. The customer service over the phone is patronizing and usually rude  we get ran through the same things about connecting wires etc  but its no help. They say they note calls but when you call back they tell you you've never called them  even though you spend hours on the phone with them a few weeks prior. We have opened up so many cases now we can't even keep track  none of the cases have been solved. The internet will drop out randomly  sometimes it will talk over 2 hours to turn back on. When the internet goes out  you get steps to follow in your browser  after about 6 times its mind numbingly annoying to go through the process of checking wires  pressing the refresh button and unplugging and plugging things back in even though my router is never touched  only ever cleaned around. On top of that  if you accidently knock over the router - or even just nudge it gently - sometimes it will totally freak out and refuse to connect to the internet.Recently  the internet drops every hour or so then connects again which is incredibly annoying. We have had a new router sent out and it made no difference. We called them today and they did some 'tests' on our landline and wireless  apparently their maybe a fault in OUR wires  they are charging and WHOPPING £129.99 to check these wires in our homes  which we are 100% sure they're is nothing wrong with them. We were previously with TalkTalk  we hope to go back to them but sadly we have to wait for our contract to end before we can do so as they said they would charge a large fee to get out of the contract and we certainly don't want to give them any more money. Avoid BT Internet at all costs.~~~,Wellingborough~~~,2015-01-29~~~,1,1,2,1
"I had been with SKY for over 14 years few small problems but always resolved quickly.

Welcome to the JOKE LAND of BT Business Total Broadband. So here and there you get some issues  sometimes for couple days  sometimes for weeks. Does anybody cares that you running your business online?Nope BT don't give a slip. Do you get compensation or something if you internet isn't properly working for two weeks? NOPE. Does anybody call to see if it's working now  after all you paying for the service? NOPE...So time passes and I receive phone call for renewal  they offering £2 discount and the bill would be £44.00 a month. Really? I been customer for more than 5 Years and I get £2?lol OKEY..I say I will shop around and ask if they could call me tomorrow  they don't sound too happy  plus now they tell me that I should call them back. Really is that how you treat your customers? So I found deal with Talk Talk who offers me same deal for £25.00. So today I get letter from BT saying I will need to pay £53.61 for stopping contract early. HOLD ON..it was just last week I spoke with them regarding renewal. So I call them..Now they telling me I have two different contracts  one for broadband and one for phone line..???but I never asked for two contracts. Yes but for broadband to work you need phone line. So how come they on two different contracts?Cos they two different services...Am confused. So broadband can't work without phone line but they on two different contracts even that broadband can't work without phone line. So wouldn't it be a common sense to put what is needed for broadband to work on one contract?ITS LIKE YOU SELLING A PERFECTLY RUNNING HORSE BUT WITHOUT LEGS which you need to buy separately. Plus because I didn't know that phone line was renewed somehow till October 2015 now I need to pay £53.61. My opinion is: BT DONT CARE about you or your business all BT WANTS is you MONEY.~~~,Leytonstone~~~,2015-01-26~~~,1,1,2,2
