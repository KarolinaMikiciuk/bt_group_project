Promised speeds nearer 50mbs and at the beginning that’s what we received  then the cancellation date passed and speed drops to18mbs. BT first say fault at the exchange  then line outside house now it’s inside the house and a possible £85 charge. Fault promised to be fixed by 26th - now 28th and still poor speed~~~,Wales~~~,2019-01-28~~~,1,1,1,5
"BT are an absolute JOKE. Ordered my installation on Jan 5 and was told would be installed on Jan 16. Install was cancelled  and due to ""technical complications"" had to cancel the order and reorder on Jan 12. That put the date back to Jan 22  but connections got it back to Jan 16. Then was told the installation was cancelled AGAIN. Was told it would be done on Jan 28  and have now been informed that the engineer WON'T be able to install... AGAIN! BT are an absolute JOKE. They're too big and just don't care about their customers. Stick with a smaller supplier who takes care of their customers.~~~",Enfield~~~,2019-01-28~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Worst company I have ever been with. Firstly they charge me for a whole year of BT sport when I never asked for it. I cancel my package with BT and they send me a final bill charging me for an extra month. They haven't got anything right from day one. Stay away~~~,Ickenham~~~,2019-01-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Reliable - check!Fast - Nah Nah!  I have fibre to the house and pay for 30Mb. Get this sometimes in the evening but during the day only 10Mb. Not technical issue as I get a ping under 10ms.~~~,MK~~~,2019-01-24~~~,1,3,1,4
Terrible customer service. I’ve moved to plusnet. So much better.~~~,Davis~~~,2019-01-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Worse customer service ever. Call them in August to renew the contract..clearly asking them to pay the same amount of money 53.73£ it was monthly. The person on the phone dishonestly told me that the bill was going to be the same and now I have a contract till February 2020 with a bill of 62.99£ for something that I didn’t ask and I didn’t want. When I have called them I was offered a discount of 4£ with a new contract for 6 months ending on August 2020. Totally joke. Can’t wait to leave them for good and not recommended to anybody. Stay away from BT!!!!~~~,Ilford ~~~,2019-01-23~~~,1,1,1,1
BT broadband is the worst broadband supplier I have ever had. Join BT if you like buffering all the time. We are paying £52 per month foe an appalling service. If we want it checked out we have to agree to pay expenses if they don’t find a fault.~~~,Oldham~~~,2019-01-23~~~,3,2,3,2
The worst service I have ever received!  I was initially sold a package which was at a great price and thought this would be a simple and successful purchase. I was informed it could take a week to install the broadband  which was not an major issue. Then I started receiving calls and messages daily from a call centre that barely talked a word of English  and after 9 days realised they were trying to tell me they had to cancel the order and start again. This frustrated me but I allowed it to happen  as I had little choice. To cut a long story short after 2-3 weeks I was told this had to happen again and it could take up to 3 months for the service to be installed. I simply told them to cancel and I would go elsewhere. This is not acceptable for this day of age  and I will never attempt to go with BT again!~~~,Radstock~~~,2019-01-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely appalling service from BT. Waited 8 weeks to get broadband and tv services  engineers not coming to appointments  no one telling me when engineers due to visit  booked time off work and no one even came. Customer services blaming outreach everytime. 7 hours of calls  8 weeks of no tv or WiFi in my home. Have gone to virgin AVOID!~~~,Northampton ~~~,2019-01-21~~~,1,1,1,1
I spent 8 months with a fraction of the speed I was supposed to get via Fibre Broadband plsu the hub kept resetting about 6 or 7 times a day.  The help I received was awful  they didnt send a new hub out when they said they would and kept threatening to charge me £130 to look at it.  Bought out the last 6 months of the contract to go back to Virgin just to stop the stress. Only chose BT for cheap sports but its really not worth the hassle~~~,Stockport~~~,2019-01-20~~~,2,1,1,1
Unable to connect to WiFi on my mobile phone  phoned BT customer service at least 10 times and was told they were sending me a new router which I've never received  on another occasion I was told the fault was reported to the installation team and they will contact me within 2 days  guess what! They never contacted me....~~~,London~~~,2019-01-20~~~,1,1,1,1
No consideration or care for customers. Phone staff say pretty things but have left 2 of my issues unresolved. Blamed me for their mistakes and have left me to pay for a TV package I cant use  due to the wiring. Was told cancelling during the Trial period was successful but am now stuck paying for something I cant use. NO HELP. NO CARE. WORST BROADBAND EXPERIENCE IVE HAD.~~~,Suffolk~~~,2019-01-19~~~,1,1,3,2
Very poor customer service. The cost for my internet increase with ~2-3 pounds every 3 to 4 months  started with 34 pounds and now I have to pay 39 99 pounds! Never again! I will switch as soon as possible. I can’t recommend BT!~~~,Newcastle upon Tyne~~~,2019-01-18~~~,1,1,5,5
Cannot det infinity where i live but upgraded to best package i could get. Supposed to get 13-21 mb download and 8 mb upload but best i get is around 5-7 upload & 1-2 download! If i’m watching bt sports or downloading i cannot even play xbox live without buffering.~~~,"Newton Abbot, Devon~~~",2019-01-18~~~,1,3,1,1
They were very polite and followed script  but the issue was not resolved and I was cut off from chat mid sentence. BT has been charging for a service it has not been able to provide for several months now due to a faulty hub which their own engineer identified and refuses to replace it without going through yet more test on the line - which is fine as the fault is not with the line  but the hub. Still not happy and no chance of repair. The customer I am representing has dementia and Alzheimer's  so you would think that they would prioritise essential services for folk with disabilities  but .... nope. They will not even discuss a refund for the months wasted trying to get the service up and running.~~~,Scotland~~~,2019-01-16~~~,3,1,1,1
Never had any problems with BTs broadband services and the smart hub range is outstanding. I don't get any buffering and the additional free services such as the free Wi-Fi hotspots are really helpful. BT can be a more expensive service but value for money especially in terms of the added free services (Wi-Fi hotspots  cloud storage and virus protect) and the broadbands performance alone makes it worth the couple of quid more you pay. overall great experience. I think a lot of people forget how much they use their broadband and don't give much thought to it other than getting the cheapest deal available. When you've got a household all using the broadband 24/7 and you've decided to pay the least you can for your internet its not surprising when you don't get a quality service.~~~,Warrington~~~,2019-01-14~~~,5,5,5,5
Pretty slow service and high cost  very bad customer service but generally OK. Will switch in the future.~~~,Kent~~~,2019-01-14~~~,3,1,2,3
Sometimes it seems like these review forums are just opportunities for people to complain and hardly anyone leaves positive reviews. Well  here is one for a change. We've been with BT for some years now and  in the past couple of years  our village has been upgraded to fibre. It is disgusting that this has taken so long  compared to other countries like Canada which laid down fibre even to outlying townships a decade ago  but there you are. Since the fibre upgrade and  obviously  the delivery of a new router  broadband has improved dramatically. Best of all is the responsiveness of the BT helpline. You now get to talk to people in the UK or Ireland and they're pretty knowledgeable. Whenever we've had broadband dropouts a quick call has restored and speeded up the service. What's more our contract is now coming to an end and I found this site because I was looking for a cheaper deal. It looked like SSE is the only reliable and recommended alternative to BT and I could make a £20 saving monthly by switching. I rang BT just to find out when my contract was ending and got talking about deals and managed to make that £20 saving by staying with them for another 18 months. I've also saved another £15 a month by switching my mobile account to them.  All in all  I'm happy with the BT performance and my dealings with them. Recommended.~~~,Huntingdon~~~,2019-01-11~~~,4,5,4,3
If I could give 0 stars I would. Our business has lost thousands in revenue promising us their service after cancelling installation SEVEN times! We were shipped from pillar to post overseas which cost a huge amount in phone costs. unreliable  inefficient; If you can't complete a service then why take it on~~~,ST HELENS ~~~,2019-01-11~~~,1,1,1,1
The most unreliable company I have come across in the entire world. The staff members are the dumbest bunch of incompetent fools in the world. BT has stolen money from me and made promises that they will reimburse me in the next bill but still have not done it. I have been trying to move my phone line from upstairs to downstairs for four months now and they have made 4 different appointments and did not show up for 2 appointments. They showed up for 2 appointments and were unable to do the job because they are just dump and pathetic.  I have probably spent over 50 hours speaking to them on the phone in the last 4 months. All the BT customer annoyance service assistants on the phone do their utmost best to annoy the **** out of you. Avoid this company at any cost.~~~,London~~~,2019-01-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Do not touch BT with a barge pole. They have been happy for me to pay well over the odds fo a long time. £35 over the odds per month to be exact. Guess that's what happens when you don't keep eagle eyes clamped on these comanies all the time! Lesson learned.~~~,Farnham~~~,2019-01-09~~~,1,1,2,2
Would have given no stars but there wasn’t an option for that..good enough to take your money off you every month because I was in a contract but paid for 11 month of no phone and broadband but won’t give me any compensation because there pathetic excuse was I wasn’t phoning them all the time to report it..I would advise to steer clear of bt don’t want to know when you complain steer clear of them better providers out there who are cheaper and have better customer services bt’s customer services is appalling.~~~,Northampton~~~,2019-01-06~~~,1,1,1,1

I went around the houses to try and arrange broadband with BT as they kept saying my house didn't exist - despite providing them with the name and mobile number of the person that did the survey and the survey reference number.  Finally got a date for installation.  The engineer turned up after the allocated time (8am-1pm) and said he couldn't do it.  Spoke to 8 different people in less than 24 hours - each one telling me something different. Still no broadband.~~~,London~~~,2019-01-04~~~,1,1,1,1
"I have landline and fibre broadband with BT. BT's customer and technical service is all mostly handled via overseas call centres  and they just seem to read scenarios off rote  so don't really listen  if they understand your problem at all  so it's a terribly frustrating experience. BT left me without a landline on and off for several months when I moved to a new place until they finally admitted the fault was with them  and eventually rectified it. It took many calls until the problem was taken seriously. Broadband fibre speeds were nowhere near what was advertised  and the service cut out quite often. Once an Openreach engineer came and noticed the wiring on the street was pretty precarious which explained why there had been so many issues. On top of all that  their service is not value for money. I was on a deal originally but I was unwell over a period during which the deal contract came to an end; they don't notify you and then started charging a hefty amount monthly as per their standard tariff  so I ended up overpaying a few hundred pounds  so keep note of your contract periods. I just swallowed it as I knew I would be moving in a few more months so kept things the same as I didn't want to pay an early exit fee if I started another contract. Of course  don't be completely fooled by ""no exit fee"" either on a standard tariff  as they will want 30 days' notice  which is effectively a hidden  fee. There are lots of better and cheaper providers out there with much better customer service. BT have lost touch and are sadly not a good provider  consistently. I won't be using them again.~~~",London~~~,2019-01-03~~~,1,1,2,2
You'll need a good 4G service with BT as the broadband is not very good. BT customer service pointed out that the fast speeds were only for people in the bigger cities. In other areas  we should expect a worse service.~~~,Weymouth~~~,2019-01-02~~~,1,1,1,1
My broadband speed is approx 1.5mbp  it’s terrrible the connection drops out and most of the time we can’t get online. We’re stuck with them for another 12 months  and it doesn’t look like anything is about to change. Wished I’d never signed up with BT as they aren’t interested in fixing this connection.~~~,Cupar~~~,2019-01-02~~~,1,4,1,1
Unreliable.When it works  it's ok  but sometimes it dies right at the time you need it and it's very annoying.It's still better than Sky but nowhere as good as BT was. Also  another problem with the Internet is that when someone uploads a file  Internet in whole house becomes unusable  so we have to use 3G internet for it instead. Not only does upload make the internet unusable  but it's also very slow and even not very big files take ages to upload!.~~~,Liverpool~~~,2018-12-31~~~,3,4,2,2
Joined bt back in November my live date was the 30th  broadband and landline was dead rang bt and they too me it was a fault on the line I got told numoures dates to go live it didn't happens no end of phone calls complaints still nothing done then Friday 28th Dec and bt customer services rang me admitting their was no fault it was the local supplier for the area who hadn't done the work in the beginning they told me I couldn't switch provider as the fault would still be there I've spoken to no end of call handlers and each one lie threw their teeth this company has the worst customer services I've ever dealt with every time I ring I get told 2 days one week and so on a outside company needs to go in and sort them out do not change to bt~~~,Wrexham~~~,2018-12-30~~~,1,1,1,1
I get BT broadband for free and I still don’t want it. Giving one star is to much. BT have the cheek to portray that the average customer rating is three star. I don’t think so. One star is more like it. Keep well away from any BT service unless you want to throw money away and go back to the 1980’s.~~~,Hampshire ~~~,2018-12-29~~~,1,1,1,1
My issue was overcharging  I agreed a price for a 12 month contract but was overcharged and the refund was agreed but I never received the refund. BT signed me up to another contract charged me £80 in equipment fees and wasn’t willing to reimburse me. Very bad experience.~~~,Bradford ~~~,2018-12-29~~~,1,1,3,3
Been with BT for many years now  consequently the most frustrating years of my life. The Broadband that BT provides is a mess. Exaggerated WiFi speeds / lieing about WiFi Speeds. Every day my WiFi goes down for no reason. BT have brought me closer to ending it all than anything else. If you're reading this. DO NOT BUY BT. DO NOT~~~,Oxford~~~,2018-12-28~~~,1,1,1,1
BT have just upgraded my broadband  during the upgrade there was an accidental break in service. I reported this at about 1700 on 27 December. A smart engineer arrived at 1100 on 28 December and tracked the fault back from the house to the cabinet  including checking the incoming wiring. All was fixed by 1230. First rate service. I also ended up with a SIM card that I didn't need  this was cancelled with a minimum of fuss. Thank you BT~~~,Southampton~~~,2018-12-28~~~,5,5,4,4
The worst internet money can buy I think bt has the worst internet quality it constantly turns off won’t connect me and they don’t offer fiber in my area depriving hundreds of people internet a really poor service~~~,North east England ~~~,2018-12-27~~~,1,1,1,1
After getting well and truly sick of BT saying 'there is nothing wrong our end' when failing miserabely to resolve the uk's worst broadband ever  I feel this statement really means 'we are still stealing a lot of money out of your bank account and giving you next to nothing in return despite knowing we are breaking our contract'. Our BB keeps dropping every few minutes  can barely stream anything of which in this day and age is a crime given the legitimate streaming services we pay a lot of money for. Yesterday I did a speed test getting 0.7mb but they are charging me for 50mb (nothing wrong our end then eh). After several phone calls and endless tech walkthroughs they literally said there is nothing more they can do and I have their 'refuse' package until July 2019. It sickens me to the core. We have brand new laptops and phones etc and they ALL drop BB frequently (but nothing wrong our end). They even suggested putting a BB signal booster between the BB router and our laptops of which is approximately 5 feet away in direct view? They even suggested hard wiring our laptops so that we have ethernet cables lying all over the living room floor? They make my blood boil and cannot stomach the name BT never mind all the rubbish they spout. Until the day I draw my last breath I will NEVER EVER have their Fisher price equipment in my house again (no offence Fisher price at least your stuff worked!)~~~,Leicester~~~,2018-12-26~~~,1,1,1,1

"First off  a one star rating for their reliability and customer service is still an overstatement. We have had issues from the start of joining them and it hasnt got better. The internet is more unreliable than anything  we thought Virgin Media were bad but currently the only thing we can rely on from BT is a lack of help from support and our internet to die. They have come out and replaced our cables as that was apparently the issue but shock horror  we are still suffering and will be without internet in the house over christmas. If you are looking to join BT i would look elsewhere  i think a potato is more reliable. Back to their support  i contacted them multiple times regarding an issue with the bt app. The first person took 20mins without answering a single question thrn directed me to an ""expert"". Thr expert then didnt have a clue and when i asked a question he couldnt answer  the chat was disconnected. Their customer service is non existant and if the answer isnt on their script they say they will send an engineer out and then say you may be charged if the fault is our end (last i checked this would still be their issue as they installed exerything)  Avoid  avoid  avoid at all costs unless they buck their ideas up and change their service completely.~~~",Aylesbury~~~,2018-12-24~~~,1,1,3,1

"Complained to BT about our Broadband constantly dropping out  each time I did this BT advised me to get a better  faster Deal  a new contract. Now we are paying over £50 a quarter. We tried to end our Contract and were advised we had to pay £216 if we pulled out. We still loose connection from time to time and BT say they don't guarantee constant connection. They said  ""Complaining on social media can be effective"" lol check out Facebook posts  EFFECTIVE? Are you kidding? We have been bludgeoned into paying more and more each time we have complained  by telling us to upgrade to this and that  and I'm sure we are not alone? Did this ever happen to YOU? We had an Openreach engineer sent out to our home to fix the fault by BT? Great he found out what was wrong  fixed the problem. All good then? No. The engineer went out to his Openreach Vehicle and filled in his report stating No problems found? WHY? Because BT-Openreach would get away with paying Compensation to Customers if the report states this. BT allowed this  turned a blind eye. Now today if the Engineer finds a fault in your home you have to pay a fee of £75. Is that the same TRUSTED Engineer from OPENREACH sent out by BT? Yes it is.I've spoken to BT today asking them to change over my account to my wife's name as my health is deteriorating and it would be less stress later on. I have also asked for a lesser cost contract £29.99 for 18 months. As advertised on TV   But they refused.After 50 years being with BT. My Advice to all that want a phone-broadband etc  stay well clear of BT. you will not be disappointed.   michael n Betty lewendonpsWere you or your family  or Buisness treated with the same Scam-Con  by BT- Openreach to deny Thousands of Customers Compensation? BT-Openreach must have all the Engineers reports  Was your fault report same as ours? Lies  Ofcom UK media watchdog  have they been informed about this pratice?~~~",READING~~~,2018-12-20~~~,1,1,1,1
