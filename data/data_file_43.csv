Switched to BT from Utility Warehouse using U Switch. All communication very good  emails from BT keeping me informed all along the way  equipment arrived when said it would  switch over happened on the day it should. All very good  nice and easy. Excellent Broadband.~~~,Cambridgeshire~~~,2016-10-17~~~,5,4,4,4
Stay away from BY at all cost  customer service is a dirty word to this company  they 100% admit I'm being overcharged every month !! But after 5 months they have done nothing about it.God knows how many hours I have now waisted trying to sort it  you just lose the will to live.~~~,Coventry~~~,2016-10-17~~~,1,1,2,2
poor customer service  signed up from broadband 4 days later still waiting to be connected.poor customer service and non existence of communication  please  please  keep away from BT.~~~,pelsall~~~,2016-10-17~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Shocking customer service; awful wifi  auto-renewed my contract even though I asked for it to be cancelled; purposefully make it hard to find out any information about your contract. Utterly useless  do not use.~~~,LONDON~~~,2016-10-16~~~,1,1,2,1
Very unhappy with the service I've received  my internet it so slow not more then one person can go on at a time  phoned up more then once to sort this but got a bill of 60 something pounds I refused to pay it! Due to not having the service I wanted and no one listening to me nor helping  man said he will up grade it  if it is not better within a week call back but I got my internet restricted so cannot go on the internet rang them up once again  explained how annoyed I was that no one was taking this into inconsideration and helping but cutting it off and refusing to help untill I pay the now £100   I asked everyone I spoke to would you pay for something that didn't work! They answered no but still tried to get my money.Very unhappy. NOTHING BUT MONEY GRABBERS!!!~~~,Milton Keynes  ~~~,2016-10-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Hopeless customer service  good enough when it is working.~~~,Letchworth~~~,2016-10-15~~~,1,1,4,4
We had no contact prior to the contract ending with BT so ended up paying a stupid price for what we had. All other contracts we have taken out have warned us that the initial contract is going to expire. After ringing their customer service we find out we have to pay a disconnection fee even though the contract has expired. Not happy about this and the fact that we were not warned the contract was expiring I asked to speak to a manager but this was not possible apparently. I have logged a complaint with them which I'm guessing does f all but worth a try. Don't go near them.~~~,~~~,2016-10-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible terrible mistake in choosing BT  broad band has not worked once since joining and will be a month in 6days since the supposed start up date. New customers considering them DONT the staff are rude and simply disconnect the phone line when they can't answer why the issue hasn't been sorted out yet or they simply transfer you back and forth between departments.  Completely incompetent and lack of knowledge.~~~,Rayleigh ~~~,2016-10-14~~~,1,1,1,1
BT Local office in Wolverhampton  are USELESS  do not get involed with them  they have addesd items to my bill  told me they would sort it all out but they never did  causing a massive problem of £4500+ overcharge.~~~,Whitchurch~~~,2016-10-14~~~,1,1,5,5
Administration!!! Are they going into administration???  Awful! No line for days.Paying for zero service.Customer service -worst ever  they put you on hold and hang up.They lie.Never turn up on the agreed date -turned up the day after.Did not do the full job on the day ie all my sockets around the house.Call them they say I have no account with them when I've been billed already.Constantly on hold.Eventually when you do get hold of somebody they advise their servers are down. There's no hope here with this company.. This sounds crazy although this is BT  they seem very dodgy as in setting up lines and contracts  with no service  and perhaps taking money.. Which is possibly fraudulent  as there's an exchange of contracts... Goods for money.. But here there is money but no goods ie no service. Is the company perhaps going into administration and perhaps trying to trap customers into contracts they want to get out of..??  And then trying to charge extra money for it  set up  non existence line rental  broadband  cancellation  and then one month extra rental for the 1month noticed period.. If this is the case then this is a money maker scheme for BT!  Customers be warned and don't bother with rubbish service.~~~,Altrincham ~~~,2016-10-14~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
where to start  I have so far spent 4 hours on the phone trying to sort out my broadband. Had a fault wit broadband on 22nd September  reported it  tracked it online and a date appeared that it would be fixed on the 28th. Evening of the 28th I called and after a long conversation and a few tests I was told it was my hub that was faulty and a new hub would be dispatched and be delivered by Friday 30th. Friday came but the hub did not  called them again and I was told it was not ordered but it would arrive on Monday. Monday came and first thing Monday morning two emails arrived in my inbox  one to say my telephone contract had been extended for another 12 months. Now I was not out of contract yet but it gets better  I was told that BT was sorry that I was leaving. I was back on the phone trying to work out how my service came to be cancelled. Nobody could explain other than a new provider was taking over my broadband  the obvious question was who was taking it over. Sorry we don't know I was told and we cannot stop it now so you will have a new activation date  Saturday 8th October. Next day(Tuesday a hub arrived)  in the meantime I purchased mobile broadband to see me through. Well BT informed me via the same email on Monday that I will have to pay £65 because I came out of my contract earlier than the 12 months agreed. I tried to find out how my service got cancelled but at the time of writing no one knows. Anyway  Saturday morning bright and early I was back on the phone to check it was happening. The first person I spoke to told me call back in 3 hours  after a few minutes I thought sod it they are incompetent  let me call again and make sure  it is Saturday after all it may well not happen. Next person on the phone said   sorry we do not do activations on Saturday  it will have t be Monday. At this point I was beyond angry and asked to speak to an English person  well a few minutes later a young man was on the phone with more bad news. Sorry there was a problem with your initial contract  we need to stop the service and start again. I thought  well if that makes it easier lets do it  so off we went  a new plan  new credit search and a new activation date and oh a new telephone number. He very politely told me  ring back on Tuesday  speak to connections and we will get the date brought forward. So Tuesday I was back on the phone  again and again more hassle. This time I was told the order did not go through  give us 24 hours and call again  so I did  just to be told the same so I thought   ley me leave them till Thursday. So today I called them again and again the same thing  sorry there is a problem with your order  we need to place a new order  man  I had enough. Please put me through to cancellations  this was done  phone rang and rand and rang and eventually went dead. Yep it did  guess what  later I got a call from BT  thought OK maybe now I will get a result. Sir  she said we need to place you a new order for a new line as a line test showed no phone line at your house  it will cost you £130.I almost fainted out of frustration. Guess what  this is not the end of it  wish I could write a blog about this~~~,egginton~~~,2016-10-13~~~,1,1,1,1
The WORST I've ever been with.Connection keeps dropping which is a HUB5 Firmware fault  but the stupid INDIAN call centre wont have it. Just had some woman on who I had to say stop shouting down the phone at me  didn't she realise I'M THE CUSTOMER!! They want me to pay £68 for the new hub out. I said Why am I going to pay for a decent broadband  when I'm ALREADY paying for a decent broadband.?? Can't get out of the contract either unless I pay the £220. Friggin unbelievable~~~,Cheshire~~~,2016-10-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
3 months now with BT infinity. Cannot get signal round the house despite their stupid advert on TV. Internet drops almost daily (not according to them) and modem constantly needs re starting. They blame the microwave!!!! modem is 40cm from my laptop so no interference. Can get engineer out but if they can't find a fault then I will have to pay £129 added to my phone bill. 9 more months and then I'm out....~~~,Cambridge~~~,2016-10-13~~~,~~~,2,4,2
I strongly advise against using their service. Poor customer service and a complete disregard that people have jobs to go to  lives to live  and generally would like an internet service in their home: My broadband hub didn't work when I set it up. I followed all the instructions and troubleshooting  even taking apart the phone socket. There was no more I could do. Their engineers (which actually are not their engineers) only work 8-6 M-F and come with a £130 fee  which is on top of the standard £50 set-up fee. The customer service lady lied to me about being able to use the BT Wifi-FOM service for the weekend I'd be without internet. Unless you live in a shopping center  this service is not available. Avoid. The cheap monthly rate will increase  and your savings will be off-set by the set-up costs.~~~,Burns~~~,2016-10-13~~~,1,1,1,1
what a shambolic company  long wait on phones so many departments  to deal with. poor information given~~~,manchester~~~,2016-10-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Speed is often around 31 can get 40 in the middle of the night. It is now 6.30 am and speed is 24.  What happened to the advertised 52? Speeds have got slower through out 18 contract.  Very close to exchange and junction box.  They keep putting up the price so while I contracted for about £18 it is now £26 I think this is a travesty on an 18 month contract. I cannot get out of it  but they keep increasing the price.  FON good.  Customer service appalling. Cut off my internet all together when switching to Fibre.  Took me many hours of chats and phone calls one of which they charged me £26   Getting past their voice activated switch board is a nightmare.    You have to hold the line and make no noise and it reverts to a key pad operation   But do not even breathe  Talking to India mostly incomprehensible.  Chat understandable but they have no authority to do anything   I hate BT with a vengeance after 45 years as a customer the last 18 months have been a nightmare. Their India operatives have no knowledge of basic uk commercial law   They have been overcharging me for 18 months.  Fon and BTwifi when out is excellent.~~~,Gloucestershire~~~,2016-10-13~~~,2,1,2,5

The worse service I have ever had. Started with a missed engineer appointment and has just gone down hill from there! Customer service team is non existent and 2 months after placing my order I finally have my service up and running! I've been transferred to their non UK based call centres more times than I can remember and have had the phone put down on me twice. I've had promises of calls back and no one calls and I've had my broadband delayed on numerous occasions without being told. Ongoing complaint with BT and trying to speak to them is impossible. When they do call me they are dismissive and for the missed appointment  which I took a day off work for  they offer me an offensive £10 compensation. I was with Sky for 5 years before BT and although they were not perfect I can see now why they are worth paying the extra!! If you are thinking of switching or joining then don't!~~~,Kent~~~,2016-10-11~~~,1,1,1,1
First off  Internet and product fantastic  no problems. CUSTOMER SERVICE NONE EXISTENT. Moving home in 2 months  wanted lines setting up in new prop before plastering and decorating. Guy said yeh no problem £50 for an engineer. I will call you in an hour to book a day. Call was never returned  neither have the last 6 calls. Over 5 hours waiting on the phone and now Im told that it wouldn't be £50  it will be £180!!! Absolute joke. Appealing customer service.~~~,Bury~~~,2016-10-11~~~,1,1,4,4
I wish I had stayed with SKY. I have issues every time I use it it says No Internet Connection despite troubleshooting all the usual things it just comes back when it feels like it. The first time it let me down I phoned BT internet helpdesk and I was on the phone for over two hours and no one helped me. Dire service and I wish I'd stayed with SKY and their service was bad.~~~,Gwent~~~,2016-10-11~~~,1,1,1,1
"Broadband stopped working a week ago  I logged the fault. I booked an engineer who visited a week later (this was the earliest appointment available). The engineer said the fault was the Hub. I have been with BT for a number of years but in the last year I have had to call them out on 4 occasions. I have been paying for a service that I received in the last year only 76% of the time making a cost loss of £156. When I informed BT that the Hub was faulty and could they send a replacement I was inormed ""certainly we will bill you £7.95 postage oh and by the way you can have a cheaper package as then you will have signed a new 12 month contract to get the Hub"". I responded that this package was the same as a current Sky deal but more expensive and also why would I want another 12 months of paying for a service that I was not getting? This was met with silience and needless to say I have taken the Sky deal. I am tired and frustrated with Bollywood Telecom's call service and being fobbed off with excuses. What BT should be doing is rewarding loyal customers and not penalising them. Unfortunately I have to give them 1 star to publish this review  I do wish review boards would work on a minus system.~~~",Yorkshire~~~,2016-10-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Aghhhhhhhhh. I apologise for the manic outburst but I have just been trying to get my BT broadband upgraded for the last three weeks  only to find I am now back where I started from!I am afraid to put the details into words in case it finally pushes me over the edge and I think I know where my wife has hidden the axe!~~~,Essex~~~,2016-10-11~~~,1,1,1,1

Well  where do I start. I signed up with BT back in May 2016. I signed up for internet and phone and accidentally accepted tv and sport. I cancelled the tv and sport the next day which I was told that it had been cancelled. It was going to take up to 2 to 3 weeks for my lines to be active. I received the modem no problem. However  when they said it was active  it wasn't. I called and found out my tv and sport was still active....strange. it gets worse!  I then checked my online account and seen a bill for £117 for canceling the tv and sport. They said there would be no charge.  A week later I still had no internet or phone line. They said all was ok on their side but a problem was on our side!! I later proceeded to cancel and was told I would get a cancellation fee of £220. Anyways ill come back to BT soon. I signed up to plusnet and got active when they set the date. Guess what! Same BT line and no problems or repairs were made!!!  Back to my BT experience. I received another bill of well over £200 and its now £460. I spoke to a manager and contested their fees. Guess what! Even after I cancelled it was not!! He then explained that he had cancelled it and will reduce the amount due to poor customer service and late cancellation.  He said I should have accepted an engineer to come out but would have to pay £116 if the problem was on my side. I told him that plusnet had taken over and no technical issues were present. He just ignored that and said I still need to pay. Madness!! I have now received a final letter of payment saying debt collectors will get involved if I don't pay! Also my credit history will be effected and or even go to court!!  My opinion to all new internet users. Do Not Go To BT!! I I'm stressed out due to this experience and have no other choice but to seek legal advice because I'm not paying for something they did not provide!!  Take my experience as a warning!~~~,Derby~~~,2016-10-09~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT for 34 years but have to say  these days they are the most incompetent organisation I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. I won't go into detail re my specific problem but I will say this. It is causing me significant stress and inconvenience yet they continue to break promise after promise. One day this will all catch up with them but until then all we can do is expose them via excellent platforms such as this.~~~,Tarporley Cheshire~~~,2016-10-09~~~,1,1,3,3
BT MUST be the worst company in the world when you have a complaint. Total lack of customer service and if they want to test my line ever again and thank me for my patience I shall scream!~~~,Weeton~~~,2016-10-09~~~,1,1,3,1

Took over a month of delays to get an engineer over at which point I decided to cancel the whole contract because this pathetic company can't manage time or appointments  made me pay over 40 pounds in the mean time buying wifi for my devices through my phone carriers. What a joke. Do not recommend at all.~~~,Manchester~~~,2016-10-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible terrible internet. the ping chart resembles a roller coaster - biggest and the most qualmish you've ridden. The connection drops on peak times and takes anywhere from 30 seconds to 3 hours if not more to come back. impossible to stay sane.~~~,Bath~~~,2016-10-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Isn't it about time that the poor service from BT was brought mote out into the open? I have had no BT sport for five weeks now. I raised the fault three times after waiting on the line for hours only for the fault to be closed without it being resolved. Finally after shouting down the phone to a woman in England she arranged for an engineer to call today. Guess what - no show! Rang BT YET AGAIN and he said he was on his way. Never arrived. Any other company would have gone  bust by now. Can't cancel without paying a ridiculous termination fee. Absolutely disgusted.~~~,Thatcham Berkshire~~~,2016-10-06~~~,1,1,1,1

Useless.....internet is that slow that I am unable to use it. Only just signed up so unable to cancel it. Phoned customer services and a complete waste of time. Would never go with them again  any other provider would be better~~~,Crewe~~~,2016-10-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely useless. Added line entries without consent. Spent 30mins trying to get it cancelled. Told default was that it was added if they didn't hear from you. How can that be correct.  In process of changing line rental and provider. Will not use BT again.  EE just as bad now they have merged or whatever~~~,Folkestone~~~,2016-10-05~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Over a year ago  we started getting problems with our internet constantly losing connection. 9 months later  and 20+ engineer visits (one of which we were incorrectly charged for! £100 taken out of our bank!) we were told there was nothing they could do. We were actually told we should move home.Guess what? We moved home. The internet is even worse. It gets up to 3.5Mbps  but spends most of the day lounging at 0.1Mbps. Unusuable. I've tried to get BT to listen  but they only seem to test it while the speed is decent  so they won't believe that there is a fault. I've been promised call backs that never happened  and the faults/complaints I raise are closed without being resolved  and therefore never get escalated.I honestly wish I'd never signed up to this terrible company. I rely on my internet for work and this is causing me considerable stress.~~~,Newcastle Upon Tyne~~~,2016-10-05~~~,1,1,1,1
I'll work backwards for this. Reliability  none  its the worst broadband service ive ever used  talk talk were rubbish but these have beat them hands down on rubbish reliability. Speed  the slowest broadband i ever used and im sorry i still say it shouldnt matter where you are in the country you should get the same service after all  you dont pay less or more based on post code. my nan works faster and she died 16 years ago. Customer service  no experience with this really as i get bored once ive sat on the phone for over half an hour waiting to talk to someone. Overall satisfaction  if i could give zero stars i would. i am going with another provider because of how bad these are so im out of contract yet they still want to charge a broadband disconnection fee. thats the best joke ive heard since i see lee evans live a few years back. BT promise all sorts and judging by these reviews and my experience i would stay well clear  well over priced for the lack of service provided.~~~,chelmsford~~~,2016-10-05~~~,1,1,1,1

Terrible  terrible  terrible. I've spent 2 hours on the phone with them and still wasn't able to sign up for a wifi. Apparently I was supposed to get my credit score check myself   pay 15pounds for that just to have my application refused. Would give 0 stars if I could.~~~,london~~~,2016-10-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Stay away from this company  DO NOT make the same mistake we did by switching to BT. Not only they lie but they also have the worse customer service you can imagine. Probably the worst company in the UK  if you switch just pray everything goes absolutely smoothly because I tiny problem will become massive by BT and their minions of useless customer service advisors that pass the buck from one to the other.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2016-10-03~~~,1,1,3,3
"Tried to get through because my Internet is not working. After 30 minutes of endless calling tone and ""thank you for calling  we're very busy"" messages I had to give up.
