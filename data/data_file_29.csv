Worst company going  no communication  if you call they hang up  if you facebook message they tell you to live chat  if you live chat they tell you to call  if you call they hang up or tell you to go online. AVOID at ALL costs! I only wanted to purchase fibre from them but after hours of going around in circles I gave up and will be going with another provider.~~~,SUSSEX~~~,2017-08-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Having phoned by to cancel my broadband because of slow WiFi I was offered a new package which included new fiber broadband. I accepted having told it was the fastest  but had to sign up for 18 months which I now regret as it is slower than the one I phoned to cancel. I complained on many occasions but was told it takes time to settle  it didn't!~~~,Huntingdon~~~,2017-08-23~~~,1,3,1,3
Completely mis sold me fibre optic broadband last year. Lied about the service altogether. Fibre worked badly for about a month after it went live  I complained. BT assured me it was just till they worked out what my line could handle etc and the service would steady out soon. NEVER happened. Eventually I lost all service. BT offered to send me out an engineer at a potential cost of around £150. Subsequently when i made a complaint they have lost any trace of me ever calling or complaining and are pursuing me for terminating my contract early. When in fact they failed to deliver the service. AVOID.~~~,durham~~~,2017-08-23~~~,1,1,1,1
"We're paying top dollar for a cheap 'n' nasty ""service"".  Unfortunately  Virgin is even worse - really abysmal reliability  fluctuating speeds  and tight limits on the quantity of data transmitted even on their ""unlimited"" tariff.At least the BT service is consistently bad  with their DNS restrictions (easily circumvented with a VPN) and lack of customer support.  They took three weeks to connect the service!~~~",Ipswich IP8~~~,2017-08-21~~~,2,1,3,3
"On the 8th August 2017 I ordered a BT Line  Broadband and TV Package. Initial payment was taken on the 8th August 2017 for this service  thus at that point a contract was formed (I do understand law). The earliest date I got for installation of these services was 24th August 2017 which was already a long lead time in my opinion and about which I complained. On the 21st August I got an abrupt text message that said ""Your new appointment is 7th September 2017"". There was no explanation nor detail provided  which in itself is an appalling way to treat Customers. I then contacted BT Customer Service Centre (oxymoron right there) which I understand is located in Bangalore. Although they are polite and try to be helpful they are totally ineffective at resolving any issues and it just ends up being a waste of time. In essence in my experience BT are a totally incompetent and useless Broadband provder  do not honour their commitments and have apallimg Customer Service. Avoid!~~~",Hampshire~~~,2017-08-21~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
After not having WiFi for around 6months finally got round to ordering some  had to wait nearly a month for my order to get fitted  which I took the day off work for. To find out that on the day for it to be fitted my order had failed and I would not be getting my broadband today. I had not been notified of this!! The man on the phone then offered to to set it up for me again  I was then put on hold for a ridiculous amount of time to where I had to hang up. I now need to re order even tho I have no idea which package I went for and will not probably have to wait another month for it to get fitted!! Ridiculous.~~~,Aberdeenshire~~~,2017-08-21~~~,1,1,1,1

We've had difficulties with our broadband service for almost a year. Every time we answer the phone the router goes off. Tablets cut off  desktop courts off  our sons UNI work cuts off  its a joke. I have been told its because we have trees near our home  I've been told its because we have a number of devices in our home and my favourite has to be  its because of the wet weather. We live in Scotland for God sake  it always rains.My recent attempt to have this sorted was 18/8/17. I was told what I knew  its either the socket or the  filter. I was told I could buy a filter locally as they are fairly inexpensive and  if I know a local electrician I could get them in.Eventually got an engineer appointment booked. I got two texts reminding me of the booking  and then a third to tell me my broadband was working fine now and the engineer had been cancelled. Yes  they had magically sorted the problem by doing absolutely nothing to rectify the phone cutting out. I phoned back and the appointment is back on apparently  but with a different type of engineer. Let's see where this goes.~~~,Clydebank~~~,2017-08-20~~~,1,1,3,1
I have the miss fortune to have changed my broadband supplier from Sky to BT...! I now wish I'd just signed up again with Sky.. but the fancy adverts and promises of fast speed lulled me into making the decision to swap provider.  Since changing we have had numerous issues just getting the service up and running... and now the service is so intermittent many of the services I intended to use are redundant... Its the last time I'll select BT for anything and will change to another provider as soon as I can build the strength to go through another router/modem change!~~~,Warwickshire~~~,2017-08-18~~~,1,2,3,1
Worst broadband ever. Their customer service is a joke. I have called them 19 times in 6 months its like they dont talk to each other as I always have to tell them the whole problem again. I have had problem after problem and its only been a year~~~,Greenford~~~,2017-08-18~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2
Hmm how do I start.I can truly say with 100% conviction that I have never had such a bad experience with any service ever. I decided to join BT after being sucked in by their adverts .I signed up to BT and was told we would be connected and ready to go on the 3rd of the month . The broadband router came as planned on the 2nd and I was excited to get it set up and running the following day . However the 3rd came and went and still had no connection . I phoned BT on the 4th to ask if there was a problem to be told that they had had a fault on their system and it would now be a further 5 working days until we would be connected . I wasn't over the moon about it but I'm a reasonable person and understand that mistakes are made and they were going to sort it as quickly as possible . The staff at this point were very apologetic and assured me that we would be connected in the 5 working days . 11 days past and we still had no connection so once again I phoned BT to see what the problem was .This time I was past around from department to department all in a non U.K. Call centre where all my questions were answered from a well read script . I felt like I was speaking to a politition every time as my question was never actually answered . After asking to speak to a manager I was told that a new connection date had been set for the 25th of the month to which I said was completely out of the question and asked again what the problem was ? This seems to be a question nobody in a BT call centre can actually answer . After a lengthy conversation that was clearly going nowhere I said I wanted to be connected that day or not at all and there the conversation ended and a phone back was guaranteed . Thus being the second phone back I was promised ( the first one never came )I did however get a call back at half 5 that evening to be told that all they could assure me of is that The 25th would definatly be our connection date but they could review it on the 17th . After having enough I went ahead and cancelled the order and phoned virgin to be told they can have me connected in 3 days . We are now happily connected with virgin and now all that remains is a refund from BT and an explanation as to what went wrong and why a massive company like BT can mess people about and treat them so very badly .~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2017-08-17~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Been a landline / infinity broadband / BT Sport TV customer for several years - on August 7th I renewed my contract on the strict understanding that I would be able to record BT Sport by exchanging my You View box for a You View Plus box. On that basis I was foolish enough to pay £208-80 landline fee 12 months in advance. Subsequently I have spoken to as many as nine individual BT employees in an attempt to resolve the recording issue by purchasing a You View Plus Box  quoted at £49 plus delivery. I have repeatedly been passed from person to person  placed on hold  hung up on  informed I need to also buy an additional TV package etc etc. Last night I again rang 0800 783 1401 number with the notion of either resolving the problem or cancelling my contract and requesting a refund. On this occasion I was kept on the line for one hour and 20 minutes while being passed to 3 different advisors  Chris in Doncaster  a lady and finally a Scotsman named John who assured me he'd have a brief word with his manager and get right back to me. 20 minutes later the connection was broken  leaving me absolutely fuming and my dinner burned to a crisp. Nevertheless  I rang 0800 783 1401 again this afternoon to cancel my contract but was persuaded by Amir Patel that the issue could be resolved  he would investigate and I could expect a call back in 30 minutes or so He said he'd generated a complaint ref No VOL013-235351101139 in the interim. Four hours later I have received no such call on either my landline or my mobile  both numbers having been supplied to BT. I have just called 0800 783 1401 yet again to cancel my contract within the 14 day cooling off period and to request a refund of the 12 months in advance landline charge which I am informed may take up to 7 working days to clear my account - took 5 minutes to leave my account. Ironically I also receive a BT bill yesterday and needless to say its also wrong. The left hand doesn't know what the right is doing resulting in disgusting treatment for loyal  longstanding customers. Never again!!~~~,OLDHAM~~~,2017-08-17~~~,3,1,5,5
If I could give less than one star I would. This is the worst customer service experience I've had with any business. BT make mistakes  don't take ownership of those mistakes and lie to you. I have no other option of provider because BY have a monopoly on fibre broadband in the Catford Green development but their own systems don't recognise that they provide this so they just send you round and round in circles. I would not recommend working with BY to anyone!~~~,London~~~,2017-08-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Very poor reliability and the customer service is none existent..~~~,Gloucestershire~~~,2017-08-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Our broadband service has been consistently bad the entire length of our contract with BT both excruciatingly slow  and intermittent every single day.  Faults never get fully resolved and customer service doesn't help with the situation.  When we eventually moved home and didn't want to take BT with us we had to pay out the rest of our contract even though they had not held up their end of the contract.  So basically the only person in contract is you  not BT.~~~,Derby~~~,2017-08-17~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst internet broadband provider ever compare to virgin and seethelight. BT  with his customer services officers are the worst in the business. I am paying £44.96 for phone and infinity 76mb. My internet is always dropping and the speed is rubbish. BT it has sent me 7 internet hubs and open reach engineers to try and resolve the problem. Customer services officers in Dakata are very rude and unprofessional. Sent email to complaint to BT over a week ago  a lady called Pooja ring me from India asking me for my full name address  telephone without introducing herself  I have to forced her name out of her mouth. BT has refused to compensate me for the inconvenience and time taking off work . I will never recommend BT to anyone.~~~,Orpington ~~~,2017-08-16~~~,1,1,1,1

Disgusting service and quality. As ours was a temporary move I was assured it would be easy to move back and quick. 6 months on we tried to do this and were told it would be approx a week then the fun begins the service was switched off 5 days early when I contacted Bt I was told nothing they could do and it would take nearly 3 weeks to reconnect. I escalated the complaint and was ring back by a very rude and intimidating lady again I escaped the complaint and said i wanted to cancel and was told some one would ring me within 24 hours. One week later someone rings no resolution just had the phibe put down on me.  I have just rang cancellations to check whether it has been done and been told i have to ring again tomorrow as they cant cancel within 24 hrs of the order been cancelled. I have now wasted countless hours talking to no one that seems to be able to do anything. I am disgusted with the conduct and manner of this company and will be going down the communication ombudsmen route as no joy with bt. I wish I had never joined this company and will make sure I never do again.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2017-08-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"My elderly parents live in a remote house on an Island in Orkney  Scotland. They have been through a tortuous year with BT as their ""service"" provider.  They have now been completely without a landline or internet for 11 weeks  let alone any chance of broadband. My father has been building a new house over the past few years next to the original croft cottage he owns. In November 2016 he contacted BT to ask them to move the line from the old house to the new house and was told this could not be done until February 2017. The phone line then developed a fault around December 2016/January 2017 time and an engineer was not sent out until February. The engineer repaired the fault but would not move the phone line. My father phoned BT again to be told that the line would be moved on the 19th May. At this point  the ""executive complaints department"" took over following a complaint. BT then came back saying that my parents would need to register the new house as a different address  despite it being literally next door to the original house. Cutting this part of the story short  the planning department at the council agreed that this was not necessary. The BT engineer failed to turn up on the 19th May  and my parent's landline and internet were both completely cut off by BT on this date. Since then  there have been 4 more arranged dates on which engineers were supposed to turn up but have not done so  with no notice or explaination.  11 weeks after the phone was cut off and the best part of year since my father asked BT to move the line and he is no closer to getting it sorted. The ""executive complaints department"" has been phoning my father on his mobile regularly but is unable to tell him why the engineers have not kept to their appointments or when they will actually turn up to fix the problem. My parents have also been in touch with the Ombudsmen  the local MP and the local newspaper and are no closer to getting a resolution  which is why I am posting on here on their behalf (they have no internet to do so themselves!) BT has a Universal Service Obligation to provide all households in the UK with a landline  even in remote parts of the country  and they are certainly not fulfilling this.  To have a working phone is a lifeline on a remote island as the mobile signal is not always great. My Father is in his 70's and my mother  her late 60's and are currently without any reliable way to contact the emergency services should the need arise.~~~","Orkney, Scotland~~~",2017-08-15~~~,1,1,1,1

Such a shame BT sell you a product then tell you two years later that you do not even receive the minimum speed because you do the speed checker and they tell you there is a fault. To add insult to injury they take from February until July after a second complaint made to get someone who speaks English to call you. No compensation! A 12 month offer on a lower speed ( because they can't supply the one they sold you in the first place) and when you call to cancel the bt sports (which was free to begin with) they make another offer which is good but no can do as we have already chosen to leave you!! A big fat con! Feel really cheated out of lots of money! AVOID~~~,Kent~~~,2017-08-14~~~,1,1,1,3
Lack of customer regard or care. Would not recommend to anyone wanting a land line and/or internet.Recently  I got a letter from BT about our service  and when reading I found out that my mother's name was still on the bill  something I have trying to sort out for years  clearly with no progress. However two weeks ago something must have changed as when I woke on Friday 4th August  I found out I had lost all internet. As a business owner (hotel and restaurant) this is a major problem as I lost connection to all social media advertisement  but even more worryingly  all online bookings (resulting in me having to stop taking online bookings  a majority of my bookings). Customers and residents expect internet as it is advertised  so we had to apologise saying I will try and sort it out on Monday (with BT being closed after 5pm Friday until Monday). Things went from bad to worse when my son informed me that he couldn't phone us up. When enquiring further  I discovered that our phone number no longer worked (for no explained reason). I later found out the BT had changed our number without informing me. I was no a business owner with no way of taking bookings. Without internet  there is no way I can update my website or social media to my new unwanted number  and all my business cards have the incorrect number on. I had to last the weekend without any phone or internet connection (unable to take any bookings or get in contact with us for enquiries or reservation) hoping that it would be sorted by someone at BT on Monday. On Monday  I got in contact with a woman at BT and asked her to fix the change. I spent hours on the phone and made no progress. The next day I tried to get in contact with the same woman but it just rang through  no-one picking up as though she was ignoring me. As a result  I had to start the whole process again with another member of the BT staff. Once again  I spent hours on the phone (from 10 until 12:30) and made no progress. My wife then got in contact with someone else at BT  who promised to sort it out  yet we haven't heard back from him. I then recalled someone at BT and get through to another member of staff. This gentleman seemed to get really annoyed with me and was not polite at all. He told me that he would sort out the internet and phone problem in 24 working hours. It had now been 5 days without phone or internet  and was going to be a further 2 days. Any l business owner would tell you problems like this can put immense pain and stress on a business; financially  and emotionally. I waited 24 working hours  and still  no improvement. I recalled BT and when through the hours long process again  only to get told at the end that they would not be able to correct the phone-line and internet 'for at least a few weeks'. THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! No small business can last weeks with no bookings  no reservations  and no enquiries. With a lack of customer service  or care and no-one from BT feeling any remorse  and worst of all  no apology for changing the phone-line and removing the internet with no warning  I would not recommend BT to anyone.~~~,Rokeby Inn~~~,2017-08-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Look at all the negative reviews. All these people can't be wrong. And they aren't. AVOID BT. I have been trying to correct an overcharging error on my account since I joined 12 months ago. I have wasted hours and hours with BT and got nowhere. They are currently overcharging me by £100 and have disconnected my broadband despite being involved in a dispute resolution process with the ombudsman over this. Their customer service is absolutely hopeless. BT need to realise that there are a finite number of potential customers in the UK and once they have annoyed/frustrated/ripped off the majority of these  they will no longer have a viable business~~~,SHROPSHIRE~~~,2017-08-11~~~,1,1,4,4

Experienced static on phone line and internet kept dropping out so phoned bt Customer service. Gentleman was polite and carried checks and said an engineer needed to call  so told him i would have to phone back with date as we both work. My partner arranged time of so we phoned bt to be told it was an external problem and an engineer would be despatched and it WOULD be fixed by the 3rd/08/2017 so we waited. By the 4th we still had the same problem  so contacted bt again and this time were told could not book engineer appointment as it was an external fault  however when i told them they had already supposedly fixed the external problem they suddenly could book an engineer  finally we thought the problem is going to get fixed  HOW WRONG WE WERE. Today 09/08/17 we recieved a text Message from bt with links so that we can check the equipment for ourselves and if bt send an engineer and find the fault is not there equipment then we will have to pay them £129.99 for the engineers visit. SURELY THIS IS WHAT YOU PAY YOUR LINE RENTAL AND BILLS FOR  ITS CALLED PIECE OF MINDAT LEAST. Have now cancelled contract and the new company are going to check everything for free(no charge)WILL NEVER USE BT AGAIN.~~~,Hampshire~~~,2017-08-10~~~,1,1,1,1

Moved to BT and what a big mistake. Broadband speed went down to less than 1mb  connection kept on dropping out  totally useless.... customer service is non existent  when you eventually get through to customer service they either put the phone down or cannot understand English and don't listen at all... also if your paying via direct debit they take double payments on various dates and when you come to the end of your contract they add charges to change provider. all of this I have documented proof of... I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BT TO ANYONE AND WILL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN FOR ANY SERVICES~~~,ruthin~~~,2017-08-08~~~,1,1,1,1
I changed to BT from Sky in the knowledge that BT are the leaders in broadband technology. What a mistake that was!!  My internet is so bad that it took me 1 hour to lodge a complaint on the BT website. Was contacted by staff who assured me my internet speed is good and the fact that I cannot stream a movie while sitting 10 foot away from the router is down to interference. Told me to get an Ethernet cable and plug it into my iPad?!? I questioned why I never suffered from interference while with Sky and had perfect connection. Staff proceeded to try and upsell me further products in order to receive a satisfactory broadband service. I stated I would not be paying more money and I felt like BT were conning customers and extorting money from them by providing a poor service in order to upsell. The staff members manager was supposed to call me back but didn't.The BT website is not user friendly for making a complaint and I believe BT are being dishonest with the service they offer. Stuck with them for 12 months now unfortunately  hopefully they'll increase their prices and give me a get out :( worst internet service since dial up!~~~,Northern Ireland~~~,2017-08-06~~~,1,1,1,1

We were stuck with BT for months. We tried to cancel after the broadband was so slow it was literally unusable  but their customer service was so bad it took many hours and phone calls before they actually did it.

Abysmal 3 Months Currently stuck with BT at the moment. Was unfortunately lulled into a false sense of trust and security by one smooth experience with them in the past. This seems like a distant memory now after 3 months of beyond the worst imaginable customer service. To elaborate on this just a little... our original order for TV and broadband was mysteriously cancelled by one of bt's own staff members and the same individual brazenly called us and suggested we had cancelled it until we were eventually told it was due to a 'supplier issue' and reorderd the package for us. There has been later suggestion that the offshore workers cancel orders and put new ones through in order to earn commission and simulate a sale that they have made... Only they did not put through a replica of the deal that we ordered. It was put through with none of the add ons  with 3 mysterious connection charges adding up to 169.99 (£100 more than the original order)  a lower broadband speed than was offered at the time of the original order and at a higher rate of expense. The cancellation meant we had to wait longer for our internet services to be switched on and a lot longer for the TV package to be fixed. Three months down the line we further still don't have the free upgrade to the higher speed broadband package that was on offer when we placed the original order  we have now been declined cashback through a third party because the original order was cancelled and therefore not tracked (this is something that is no fault of our own but sees us £90 down - an incentive behind our choice taken away from us). All this doesn't even take into account the time that my partner and I have had to waste talking to bt representatives  incredibly disruptive to both work and free time. Representatives that call randomly (instead of ant previously agreed times) and make it incredibly difficult to get back in touch with them. I don't think any of them read the notes  we were constantly having to spend time re-explaining the complete mess they had made of it. Very few positives to be said for the process and absolutely no sign of an apology. Our open complaint seems to have now disappeared for a second time and there seems to be no level of accountability being taken - it's as if we are wasting their time. To top this off  our broadband stopped working 6 days ago. We logged the issue with them and there was supposed to be a three day turnaround. What actually appears to have happened is they have closed the initial log as complete (pretending they met their SLA) and then re-logged the issue themselves at a later date... 6 days on we are still waiting with no internet and no contact from BT. This really is only the key points and I think I could now spend weeks writing a book on the failings of BT.  I can't recommend due to their inability to provide a reliable service or react with any level of problem solving ability and customer care when things do go wrong. We still live in hope that they show us some respect and somehow turn it around.~~~,London~~~,2017-08-02~~~,1,1,3,1
Terrible  terrible and worse than terrible.  I moved to the UK from the US. Prior tenants had used BT fibre broadband and TV so I contacted them and requested same plus phone.  After three weeks of waiting  6+ phone calls to BT's incompetent staff  multiple nonsensical explanations as to why they hadn't activated my broadband  a visit by a confused BT phone tech who had no idea why he was sent to check my perfectly operating phone line  multiple broken promises and lies in several different accents  no e-mail updates or any kind of return communications from BT (including a BT rep who scheduled a day and time to call me and never did) and their inability to set up my tv whilst the broadband wasn't connected  I gave up.  BT is probably the worst company I have ever had the displeasure of trying to work with.  British radio is wonderful  but three weeks disconnected from the outside world was too much. Fortunately  Sky for tv was an absolute joy to work with and Zen for fibre broadband was equally uncomplicated. If the B in BT stands for British then they are a national disgrace.~~~,Preston~~~,2017-08-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute scum of the earth.  When the bt broadband contract runs out they hype the cost up massively and don’t tell you.  When you come to renew they don’t give you the same deal as a new customer can get on their website  they expect you to pay more.  Absolutely no loyalty.  And when you say you want to cancel and go with another company they make it really difficult and put you through to these people who have a really bad attitudes and speak to you like your stupid.  Trying to negotiate with the price when all I want to do is leave them and not get messed about.  And then they charge you for ending the contract even though its out of contract.  Awful experience.  I will never go with BT for as long as I live.  I’d rather pay more with another company.  I would recommend avoiding BT at all costs.~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-08-02~~~,1,1,2,2
"Awful  don't get. My internet has not gone a full day without shutting off at least 3 times. At the moment it is shutting off every 10 or so minutes. Customer service is awful as they haven't a clue what they are doing. In the end after 3 calls we were told to disconnect our phones when needing wifi  disconnect all other electronic devices that require wifi and finally to just ""reset it"" - spoiler alert none of these worked. They all made it worse and ended up getting rid of our home phones for three days. Don't listen to their offers as they are liars about that too.
