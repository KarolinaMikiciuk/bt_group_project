Leaving BT today Appalling customer service  billing incomprehensible both written and verbal. Institutional rip off the worst kind. Do not use these idiots~~~,Belfast BT8 8DA~~~,2016-05-05~~~,1,1,3,3
Paid for BT Infinity2 - realised that my speeds weren't correct  so did a speed check. 19mbps! Phoned them up. Said an engineer was booked  then received emails and phone calls saying it was an exchange problem  so the engineer was cancelled. Went out on the day the engineer was supposed to come  thinking that it had been cancelled  only to get a phone call from the engineer saying he was on his way. Apparently the lines coming into my house were the wrong type for infinity 2. Once he sorted the setup  the internet speed hadn't improved  so after visiting the junction box  he informed me that there were 'manhole' repairs to be performed. I've had my BT contract for over 6 months and paying for the infinity 2 service  but didn't have the correct setup coming into my house. I keep getting passed from pillar to post. The customer services staff agree with all you say  but nothing actually gets done to solve the problem. I'm getting to the point I want to wring someone's neck  but there is no one there with responsibility. I am sooooo frustrated!!!~~~,Middlewich~~~,2016-05-04~~~,1,1,1,3
We changed from sky to BT. BIGGEST mistake! Half the equipt didn't turn up in time  so 2 engineer appts had to be made. Now the broadband is sooooo slow. Can't get half the channels. Customer service has told me to check google to see signal strength. Something I thought they would do prior to ordering the service.They just want yr money and do not care if things are not right. Do NOT go with BT infinity !!!!~~~,Northumberland~~~,2016-05-03~~~,1,1,1,1
This is about the BT fibre to home service. A complete joke. I have been waiting for the order (paid in March 2016) for 6 weeks now but the orders (yes  re-ordered) kept got cancelled without telling me the reason. The only way to contact is through 08005874787 and you have to wait for at least 15 minutes to get to talk to someone who doesn't know the answer to your problem.  The problem is it's a new built and BT provided the router system so no other providers can set up the broadband service for me except BT--- Monopoly is really bad for consumers --- a new evidence!  Just now I called and was told to wait for a call from them  just like what happen on Last Friday. I never got the Call!  Please tell me how I can make a complain!  It is terrible! what's wrong with BT!~~~,London~~~,2016-05-03~~~,1,2,1,1
"Forever having direct debit problems on monthly payment plan of £53 a month so I can budget  BT just help themselves to double from my account most months and I have tried to call numerous times to rectify and it goes back to normal for a month then back to double payments again. Have been cut off by rude indian staff numerous times after spending half hour explaining the situation. One woman ""anya"" was so rude on the phone to me and shouting I said I would report and she said she didnt care and hung up!! Worst customer service ever they have no clue and spin you stories and are very rude!~~~",Ely~~~,2016-05-02~~~,1,1,3,3
The customer service reps are completely Useless. I had intermittent  internet connection for about 4 months where suddenly the connection would drop and not connect again. I had to get 3 bt engineers out which all said there was nothing wrong even when they saw the problem happening. This resulted in my diagnosing the issue myself and actually fixing it myself! The came a time which now my BT Vision box doesnt work  my recordings fail or my chanels get Pixelated. broadband and aerial are fine which all points to the box. BT would not swap this out for me but sent an engineer out who was 2 hours late and all he did was a rest on the box. The following dady i checked and it still wasnt working so going back to BT they not expect me to run all these checks again! The customer service and engineers are useless so dont waste your money on this company go for a better one where you will get the service you pay for!~~~,Basingstoke~~~,2016-05-02~~~,1,1,4,2
As a new customer I was told it would be two weeks before I receive my router this was the quickest they could send one out. I recieved the router exactly two weeks later and installed it only to find that when they said it would go live it didn't. After phoning the customer service number I was informed after 40 minutes waiting I was talking to someone in India which is where the BT customer service team is based. When i informed them of my lack of service they informed me it would be fixed within 48 hours. Now 72 hours later I rang them back where I was told it will not be fixed for another 4 days. This means from initially starting my contract with BT it will of been 3 weeks before I have the chance of internet. The customer service is shoddy and 'british telecom' seem to have no interest in the British customer. Appaling.~~~,Shrewsbury ~~~,2016-05-01~~~,1,1,2,1
"DON'T USE THIS COMPANY... MISS SELLING IS RIFE... Think of the worst double glazing company and x it by 10.. We were missed sold the package by a telephone sales rep... He promised 4 times faster connection then our existing SKY broadband  and that we could connect 7 wireless devices.... Well we are sitting here with less then 1 meg and unable to connect any devices wirelessly... It took over 1 hour to down load a film on sky.... BT take no responsibility for the false promises made and completely disregard the fact that there representative lied and missed sold... We are now left stuck in battle to increase the speed of our broadband so me and my family can live life how we used to.... BT's answer "" YOU CAN UPGRADE FOR AN ADDITIONAL £18.00 PER MONTH"" This is an obvious plan to sell poor quality products and service and false people into having to upgrade... TERRIBLE COMPANY THAT DESERVES TO GO BANKRUPT.  LESS THANK 1 STAR~~~",wickford~~~,2016-05-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful  just awful. I upgraded to Infinity last year  but in the past 2 months the amount of dropping out that is going on is so bad that I am now losing money because of the constant unreliability issues of BT infinity. I have had an Engineer visit my property on 3 occasions in the past month only to tell me I have nothing wrong with my internet connection  etc  etc. However  the person I am dealing with at BT agrees that I have issues as he has been monitoring it  but apparently he unable to advice on whether I can get out of my contract in order to go to Sky Fibre without a massive charge from BT for the remainder of my contract.  Even though that BT are in breach of their own terms  I am unable to get out of the contract  even if the person at BT who has been monitoring the issues agrees that I have issues with my broadband  but they are unable to rectify those issues by simply allowing me to get out of my contract. So he admits I have these problems and they are not honoring their own service contract  but I am unable to get out of it  ha ha.  Awful company that insults my intelligence and I am sure many other peoples intelligence.  They are a joke of a communications company  and my telephone and broadband spend is annually around £2000+.  Well they can F off because that business on the two lines I have in my house  including my home office and broadband are all going to Sky as soon as I can get away from BT. The way they have handled this problem has been just utterly stressful and inept. The loss of money I have had due to one specific day where the router crashed 14 times  yes 14 times in an afternoon was just stressful and completely unacceptable.  I am going to seek legal advice on how to force BT to let me out of the contract and also seek substantial damages for the loss of £ due to the unreliability of their inept infinity service.   I will also add  that BT throttle the network everyone. I know this from a friend of mine who just happens to be a BT Engineer who has worked for BT for 20 years  has basically spilled the beans as to why I really have issues with my Broadband and why so many BT customers have issues  it is because they throttle the network to boost other areas of the network. Obviously this is completely illegal and BT are walking on really thin ice. I have had enough of BT  the stress of dealing with them  they are the most inept company that I have ever dealt with. I am going to sue them for damages and I am going to go public with my findings about how they throttle the network.  BT made the wrong move by aggravating me.  Now it is my turn to cause them stress and embarrassment along the way. 1/10 for BT in general. Sky offer a far superior service.  They may not be the fastest  but they are more reliable and far cheaper to use. Virgin like BT are inept as well from what I understand  and they too have been from what I hear been throttling the network.  Completely illegal  and I hope they get massively fined for it one day and taught a lesson.~~~,Pontypool~~~,2016-04-30~~~,1,1,2,1

The great BT con. We went with BT because they promised a reliable service oh what a mistake. 6 mths down the line we find ourselves trapped with a shambolic result. Promised with a minimum of 3mb ( which is still pathetic) and a promise of a get out if it fails our average for the past month is .79 yet because it reaches 3 at least once a week they want £ 180 to terminate the contract  con being the operative par. our neighbour has managed to sort them out but only after legal action and we don't have that sort of cash to throw away. meanwhile we are stuck with helplines that don't speak English and a useless service. WARNING stay away from BT~~~,mistley~~~,2016-04-30~~~,1,1,1,1
SAVE YOUR MONEY--FOR A COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY THEY ARE A HUGE  FRUSTRATING JOKE. We have switched from SKY and their ever increasing costs and lack of loyalty to loyal customers  to BT INFINITY 2 home hub 5. Plus the TV package etc. In addition we requested a landline and Internet installation at our houseboat ( that's a whole other sorry tale)The speeds are rubbish  the connection constantly drops out and streaming is useless.According to BT there is no problem  and they have suggested lots of technical things WE could do to try to improve connection and speeds  as well as things like not having more than 1 device connected  moving the modem into the middle of the house  not trying to use the Internet whilst watching a film......I could go on but REALLY.Our house isn't  large and there's only us 2 old codgers in it.We aren't technically knowledgeable nor are we engineers  so the technical suggestions they have made might as well have been in Chinese  all we want is to be able to switch on  watch to/ movies/sports and check e nails/ browse the web and download books and music  I don't believe any of these things place huge demand on the poor old broadband  but it seems they completely overtax it. I have moved all electrical apparatus away although the tv is kind of integral to the package! I draw the line at knocking down walls  and majority of the time I'm sat no more than 10 feet from the router. I had the installation done by their engineers  but despite this it's still rubbish.Wish we could get Virgin in our area  but for now looks like I will have to go back to SKY and their slow expensive but reliable service.

where do I begin.....just dont use them  I went online ordered infinity2  they gave me date for two weeks and.... well nothing happened so I called back in.on hold for 10 mins as is the norm and a bloke answered  kept me on hold for 10 mins to speak to someone who may help me but put me through to another department without saying anything  guess what another 10 mins on hold then a very unhelpful lady from India said the reason I had not got the broadband was the order I put in hadn't gone through and that it was my fault   so I queried why I had been given a date and why someone had called me to check the line number was correct to which she said I have cancelled your order and you will have to go back on again and carry out another order..... so I replied you have been most unhelpful  thank you very much for cancelling the order you have saved me some time goodbye.~~~,worksop ~~~,2016-04-29~~~,1,1,1,1
We moved over to BT Infinity having been promised wonderful connection throughout the house....  They lied!  We can only get broadband in the room where the hub is situated.   I caught my husband sobbing when he realised that if I wanted to be on the computer in the study then he couldn't watch TV through sky connect.  I now have the hub as a wonderful ornament in the hallway  by the lounge door  whilst I sit in the kitchen with my Ipad - still wondering what I can use my study for! I contacted BT  Consumer Services are extremely rude and unhelpful.  I can leave BT if I pay £700 - yipee  so stuck with them for another 9 long months  but leave them I shall. If you're looking for a decent broadband provider AVOID BT~~~,Folkestone~~~,2016-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1
I am disgusted with the poor customer service. I was with Fleur telecom who are exellent  but dont provide fibre in this area. So i signed up for fibre with BT. External works due then a week later internal works. External engineer did not  do the job  no one kept us informed   then today the day before the connection was due  openreach phoned to say they cant do the connection as the external work hasn't been done. BT customer services said they would still be cutting me off tomorrow for an undetermined length of time. THe engineer would give a report within 2 weeks! I told them i am a GP and work from home out of hours telephone triage for emergencies. they said it made no difference. I said it was entirely their error why cant they stop the cut off  they said it's at the stage of no retur. I asked to speak to a manager and am awaiting the call back. I am gobsmacked at the appauling service. Entirely their error but absolutley no acknowlegement and no concern for my livelihood nor patient's lives. Plus they have taken £74.11 out of my account without having provided the service and still want to cut me off! I phoned Fleur telecom who were brilliant as usual. They have put a stop on any hand over to BT for tomorrow so hopefully that will work. I will be cancelling the fibre broadband package with BT even though it's over the cooling off period so no doubt they will want to charge me. I will be contacting DSA and taking this further. THey have not delivered on their contract and therefore i will not pay. What a lousy company. I will never go with BT again.~~~,Herefordshire~~~,2016-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst service i have ever came accross. Priced way to high. It took over 1 hour and 4 differnt departments. 1 in india and 3 other cities in the uk.How old peaple get anywhere with them i dred to think. But that is how they rip customers off.No loyalty from them.vafter 40 years.Stay clear~~~,leicester~~~,2016-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1
I switched from talk talk to BT 18 months ago as they had a good deal and we're offering 50£ worth of vouchers yet all that was not worth it ... speeds are same or worse than TT prices higher  customer service useless ... Oh and forgot to mention that no sign of that promised 50£ Voucher (said that I do not qualify as I requested it too late ... 6 month time limit and I filled the form on 3rd month so I was basically robbed) switching to plus net now. Cheers~~~,London~~~,2016-04-28~~~,1,1,2,2
Switched from copperwire broadband to the fibre optic (infinity broadband) 54mbps allegedly getting between 30-35mbps. Switched because old broadband was around 17mbps   also router kept resetting   was told because we were running too many devices at once?  The hub was struggling and that the new hub could handle the load much better   however still getting the same problems as before   internet keeps dropping whilst watching youtube or facetime   even dropped whilst playing xbox online at 2am with no other devices connected!~~~,Nelson~~~,2016-04-28~~~,1,1,3,1
The worst customer service in history! First  the order was messed up. This delayed the installation by 2 weeks! Then the engineer did not show up on my day off that I took specifically for that!!!!!!! Then I was 3 hours on the phone to find out what happened! Them they refused to schedule an appointment for a more specific time! Then they forgot to send me a confirmation of a new date! We are ready to take a legal action!!!!!!!~~~,London~~~,2016-04-27~~~,1,1,1,1

"Quite possibly the single worst experience iv had in dealing with any company .when I was getting an intermittent fault with the net going offline 5-6 times a day when I asked the BT agent why should I have to pay for a service like this the reply was ""thats just the way it is "" Im now with plusnet !~~~",Glasgow~~~,2016-04-26~~~,1,1,4,1
Just finishing my 1st years contract with BT Broadband  it was like a farce at the theatre  suddenly cancelled my service by mistake and tried to charge me £55  this involved many many calls to India where no one listened or changed anything  have been complaining about the drop out (can't actually use wireless unless Im literally standing over the router and even then its intermittent) but it took nearly 8 months for them to send a new one!  Have now signed up with another provider and they are blocking the transfer  I have complained officially  no response  called and wasted several hours of my life being put through to various useless people who DONT help  now finally had enough - DONT USE THIS COMPANY!~~~,London~~~,2016-04-24~~~,1,1,1,1
I have infinity 2 and get less than infinity 1 speeds - It was better until I cancelled BT Vision - now they are saying line speeds have increased but ours has fallen by around 5mbs and the drop out rate has increased. They give it away to new customers but charge older ones more and ore fort less and less service and trying to contact them or get a straight response is beyond my comprehension. Overall pretty dismal service.~~~,East Boldon~~~,2016-04-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Cant describe the frustration   original connection date 07/03/16 now quoting 05/05/16 . Have spent 90 minutes   25 minutes  45 minutes  45 minutes on the phone . The result each time? they hang up . Don't go near them.~~~,Wigan~~~,2016-04-22~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I've had BT for over a year and the first year was fine.  Then this month my broadband went down 3 times for a total of 2 weeks and my phone went down for 1 week. BT decided instead of refunding me for 1/2 the MONTH of broadband and 1 week of the phone  they would refund me for 1/2 a WEEK of broadband and 1 week of phone. Seems a bit unfair doesn't it.~~~,London~~~,2016-04-21~~~,1,1,3,1
Broadband drop out rate unacceptable.  Frustrating  time wasting calls to India with no resolution  line refreshed  no more problems.  Do they not keep a log of the number of call received from the same person  every time you have to go over and over the same things again.  Might I remind BT we are still being charged for this very ineffective service.  It is all very well to say do things on line  most of the time you cannot get on line.  We had four emails regarding the engineer who supposedly came to fix the problem  guess what we could not read them until he had left and BT deemed it acceptable to let us have an Internet connection for a few hours.Thoroughly disgusted.~~~,Rural~~~,2016-04-21~~~,1,1,1,1

I have fibre optic 76Mbs I get about 60.  BUT it seems everytime a BT Openreach guy shows up to do something with the exchange box on the street my connection drops. This happens about 4-5 times a week.Recently my phone & broadband went down and I looked and saw the Openreach guy at the box.  It never came back up.  I have called everything single day for a week and get the roundaround from a support centre in India somewhere.  No one calls back  and they keep saying it will be fixed today. DISGUSTING.   I tried to raise a complaint and the customer service person said there was no Complaints Dept at BT! Clearly they don't have enough engineers and the support desk lie.~~~,London~~~,2016-04-20~~~,1,1,3,2
I cannot put across strongly enough how many problems BT have caused through a simple telephone system office install  not to mention the extreme costs quoted by inexperience's representatives.  No care in the world for any downtime for our company or cost and time taken to fix the problem that were created needlessly after multiple conversations about the same thing.  Internal accounting processes are shocking and everything promised or anything amended goes wrong (I mean EVERYTHING). Not one representative that visited us knew what the plan was after a total of 6 x meetings and multiple engineering visits. The wrong equipment was supplied for which we were charged after advising multiple people BT;s end about the incorrect delivery. Delays of over 2 months for office renervation all down to BT and lack of planning.  Very unprofessional  as a whole and not impressed at all  will be pulling plug on BT as soon as i am able.  I will never be using BT again for commercial or private use out of principle - Terrible service! - DO NOT USE~~~,Wales~~~,2016-04-20~~~,1,1,1,1
worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life!! so my broadband was due to renew  was offered an ok deal to stay with bt  so said yes to it  after being in phone for 1 hour  for some reason they couldn't load the order put me through to guy in india  he said he couldn't fix it and I would get a call back on Monday( this was Friday. Mondays call didn't come  so phoned Tuesday as my deal was due to expire on the Thursday  girl answered put me on hold for 30 minutes  then line goes dead. called back again next day to be told all sorted  got home Thursday night service cancelled. called bt next day  got cheeky girl on other end who started to ask why didn't I call last night?? obviously my call was an inconvenience to her  asked for her name to complain  she wouldn't give me her full name  and proceeded to argue with me for the call. so told I would get call back   guess what call didn't come. so iv phoned bt 14 times totalling around 4 hours on phone  each time explaining my situation again. each time bar 1 get a defensive person on other line who proceeds to argue with me  customer service is obviously something that bt don't care about. week on and still no issue resolved  each day I have to phone and go through scenario all over again and get promised a call back that never comes. last call girl actually had the cheek to say they have been trying to call me. so if you want bad service  you want to frustrate yourself and get nothing in return and abused by call centre staff and listen to hold music for 40 minutes at a time  join bt  I know I really regret it. such a shame that what was once a great national company has let itself go this badly.~~~,belfast~~~,2016-04-20~~~,1,1,1,1

On the 76MB 'Pro' package. Connectivity consistently drops throughout the day  and speeds when connectivity is available is comedically short of the 76Mb headline speed. On a good day wifi speeds are around 2mb and hard wired speeds closer to 6mb. Utter joke. Unfortunately Virgin Media isn't available  so only alternative option is to stick with whichever ISP chooses to front the BT 76Mb service claim.~~~,South Bucks~~~,2016-04-16~~~,2,1,1,2

Probably the worst company I have ever had dealings with.The equipment never turned up for ten days and only then when I sent in two letters complaining.I asked theam to cancel within the 14 days they still carried on.When I asked for a credit for the 10 days of service I missed out on they said yes.Then stopped my account as I didn't pay.The reason I didn't pay I was awaiting a credit.Told them to shut it all down cost £137 for 2 months and for ten days of that I didn't have a service but still got charged.Ensure your equipment arrives before the package and within the 14 day cancellation.I have had to pay for their mistakes but it was the only way I could get rid of them.Call themselves British they should be ashamed of the service they provide or not.~~~,Staffordshire~~~,2016-04-14~~~,1,1,3,3
