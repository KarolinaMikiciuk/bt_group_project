I changed from Sky to BT to get their infinity  package's promised speed. First of all. My connection was not changed. They kept me on the cooper wire. Connection drops so often that is ridiculous. I should have stayed with slower but more reliable connection~~~,NW116AT~~~,2016-04-12~~~,1,3,4,1
Our internet crashed today  not great when you're working in a busy office that relies heavily on the internet. I spoke to Val from BT who was very helpful and incredibly patient considering I did not have a lot of the information needed to help her work out the problem. She got our internet back up and running again and was very friendly to talk to. Thanks Val!~~~,Bushey~~~,2016-04-12~~~,4,5,3,4
Extremely poor service especially when trying to report a problem -(aways foreign speaking engineers you cannot understand them and they cannot understand you  and the problem doesn't always get resolved) in contrast should you require to purchase something you get clear and precise english speaking assistants. overall a very very disappointing broadband service~~~,Kingsclere~~~,2016-04-12~~~,1,1,1,1
I have a basic BT broadband package as we are still on the copper wire network  so paying extra for Infinity is pointless. WHEN it works  the speed is fine  but it drops out at least once an hour  usually for about 5-10 minutes  so streaming live movies is a test of my patience. BT customer service is appalling. After waiting 20-30 minutes to actually speak to someone  they just respond with a sales pitch for Infinity. Their website is as unreliable as the rest of their internet services. I have been trying to set up a secondary email for a family member. It's a relatively easy process (if it were with any other provider) but the BT website keeps crashing on the final page and  you guessed it  no-one to fix the problem and I'm now on the fourth DAY of attempting it. I have 8 months left on my contract but I can't seem to find a provider who actually provides the service they advertise. I'm not asking for some all singing service that will run a space station full of live games  just a very basic  reliable internet service.~~~,Staffordshire~~~,2016-04-09~~~,1,1,2,1
When you go to desk top help and they tell you (1) Switch off the power supply at the socket or pull the power lead from the back of your hub. (2) Wait for the green light to come on you know something's not right~~~,Foulden~~~,2016-04-09~~~,2,2,1,2
The service has always been poor.  Now BT have introduced Open zone locally  the service drops 4-10 times an hour.  BT like to tell me the speed is good at the local exchange - but that's not where I live.~~~,Scotland~~~,2016-04-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Diabolical speed from BT (1MB ONLY!) Supposedly upgraded Shebbear exchange. Waste of money.... no better than before. Fibre cables put in to within 200m of property but have they offered to connect us to provide AT LEAST the 8MB we are supposed to be able to get? HAVE THEY HECK! Just can't be bothered. No doubt the excuse is 'not enough customers in our post code so get lost!'~~~,North Devon~~~,2016-04-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst  sorry excuse of a company I have ever had the displeasure of coming across. Do yourself a favour and switch to people who don't scam you of your money. I don't recommend these utter scammers at all.~~~,~~~,2016-04-07~~~,1,1,1,1
First of all I have to say I resent giving even one star because BT really deserve a big fat zero. Having been with TalkTalk I decided to move across to BT Infinity when I moved house.  I called and went through the order process  and was advised that BT would sequester my existing number from TalkTalk and move the service across to coincide with my move in February 2015.  Cool!  I paid a years line rental up front along with an extortionate connection fee and looked forward to my super fast internet and phone service. The first red flag was when the engineer didn't turn up as booked.  I called BT and was connected to their call centre in India  and was informed that the work had been carried out remotely and my service would be active before midnight.  The following day I had a dialling tone (RESULT!)  However  when i called my home number the phone didn't ring.  I call call out but couldn't receive incoming calls and the internet was S.....L....O....W....   After many  MANY weeks of dealing with the same individual in India  (I didn't request the same person - she was the only operative who ever answered the phone) I was getting nowhere.  Then  out of the blue TalkTalk emailed me my latest bill.   Um... How can this be when BT provide my service?   Well  it turned out that BT had never adopted the line but had partially switched it at the exchange.  Soooooo  when I called out it was with BT  but incoming calls were received via TalkTalk....wait for it.... AT MY OLD HOUSE!!!!!  Isn't that brilliant?!  Seriously  you can't make this stuff up.   I called BT again...and got through to the same person in India again...and I explained the situation again...and she promised me she would fix it again... In fact she promised me she would fix it by the following day and then call me to make sure everything was working as it should be.  No one called. I called BT again... and got through to the same person again...  She told me she had actually tried to call me the previous day  but no one had answered.   Um... because it didn't ring.  That was the issue in the first place!    This went on and on for months.  Me pleading  begging and eventually threatening. Them nodding  smiling and doing nothing. Eventually I did manage to get the phone issue sorted  but only after a very nice man at TalkTalk offered to contact BT and idiot talk them through the line transfer process.  (Thank you TalkTalk  I'll be back as soon as Im out of contract). Anyway  to cut a long story short-(ish)  its a year on  I now have phone service  but I'm paying for BT Infinity whilst they provide regular broadband.  Aaaaand I've yet to receive the refund i was promised. But it's ok... they're working on it. Don't do it people.  Buy your broadband elsewhere.  Life is just too short.~~~,Kent~~~,2016-04-06~~~,1,1,1,1
I would suggest that anyone thinking of using BT to avoid them like the plaque. I have had sky and Virginia before and have had much better service. My experience with BT gas been bad from the start. When I originally enquired they said set up was free and they would be out in a week to install  then after hearing nothing I phoned  to find out what was going on and they say they wouldn't be attending and it was going to cost me £150 to get install  after refusing to pay I get a phone call two weeks later to ask if I was interested in BT TV I explained what had happened and was Informed I would not be charged.  So I thought second chance and all that so I agree and went a head adding sky to the package. Two weeks after my box arrives for Internet no sign of engineer so I phoned and they said that I would be charged and the engineer couldn't attend today  after complaint again two weeks after that they set up my Internet  when I phoned again to say my TV box had not arrived they said you never had that package after complaining two weeks later I received a box which wouldn't work  I phoned to complain and they said my Internet was not strong enough after further investigation from another department it turns out my signal was just fine and that they hadn't set it up or something  now after my many complaints and 7months of waiting and endless phone calls I had a manager phone to say I will give you £50 off of your first bill as a gesture of good will. Good will after all that I don't think so. Anyway after all that my first bill comes and states I owe £45 so I phoned and was told to ignore it even though they try'd to take it out of my bank   then again a letter comes through saying my bank has declined it twice and I will now be charged for this as well as. So I phone again and get told I had to pay my next months bill a month in advance. Well as you can imagine I was not impressed.  To also find out it will cost me over £50 pm. So much for good will.  I have hated the service provided by them they never gave me any compensation for everything I had been through. I would never recommend them to any one. Avoid them  they have no concern with service or there customers they just want money. You may pay slightly more for Sky or Virgin but you will receive a much better service.~~~,Taunton ~~~,2016-04-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
It took over 4+ months by BT in LONDON to get my Fibre up and running which previously had been running PERFECTLY for 2 years.  Terrible customer service  multiple engineers visits (6) often out of the blue and essentially an organisation who has no idea about it's core business anymore.  Was offered £4 compensation for over 6 months of useless customer service that often suffered from drop outs and took my complaint to the highest level.  When you do they then mess with your connection further as you've black listed and it would stop every so often.   I work in the IT industry so know how things run and often was told the problem was always in my end  i.e. home and not their network whilst i knew otherwise and fought them to address it.  You're consistently threatened with charges if you're found to be wrong so it's a VERY good thing i know whats's what and refused their rubbish assumptions and analysis.  Avoid BT like the plague!!!  Z**** Have moved to Virgin Media and their worlds apart.  BT should be broken up and sold off it has no idea what it's doing anymore!!!!!!!  Will never use AGAIN!!! 18 months of pure crap!~~~,London~~~,2016-04-05~~~,1,1,1,1

My Broadband drops out 2-3 times for circa 30 minutes every evening. BT Customer Service is even worse- it is impossible to get through as they are always very busy which I guess in understable. DO NOT USE BT BROADBAND!!~~~,New Malden~~~,2016-04-04~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT are by far the worst large company I have ever had to deal with. I have had an intermittent broadband fault for over a year that many competent providers would have diagnosed and fixed but not BT. The customer service (only good thing is 150 is free) frequently has delays of 30 minutes plus  9 times out of 10 you deal with off-shore call centres who do not have much knowledge and are difficult to converse with and on two occasions hung up on me (no swearing or shouting either). When you do complain this falls on deaf ears and the promised callbacks fail to be honored even when they send texts confirming the date and time. As an organization they have become a joke in terms of customer service  even in a non-fault related manner there ordering process is a comedy of errors. Finally when BT stuffs up most major suppliers would offer a bit of compensation as a way of goodwill  however with BT you have to plead your case and when they finally pay out this is a computer calculated amount of a pittance that bears no relation to the stress you will have endured dealing with them. If you can choose anyone other than BT I would advise you to seriously consider your health and mental sanity before joining them.~~~,North Yorkshire~~~,2016-04-04~~~,1,1,2,1
Terrible customer service. Disconneting calls  staff saying over and over this same without listening  not helpful at all. Delay with connections  no help during the weekend. Sending not updated bill. Broadband slower than others company. AVOID~~~,Manchester ~~~,2016-04-03~~~,~~~,~~~,2,~~~
BT infinity with Hub 5 - dont bother.The speed is not the issue. Works fine when it works but it constantly drops and BT have no idea why.Have had 4 routers in 18 months. Still got issues now.Once the router failed completely and had to wait 3 days for a call back only to say they will order me a new one. Another 3 day wait.Connects to andriod most times but hates Iphone for some reason. 18 months is over so now cancelled. Sky was better before even if slower.~~~,Midlands~~~,2016-04-02~~~,2,2,3,1

Well  after having the one with terrible customer service (Talktalk)  the one owned by BT (Plusnet) and BT itself now I can honestly say that BT'S broadband is the least reliable of them all. Plusnet and Talktalk provided faultless service however Plusnet does have the edge on customer service. I will be leaving BT at the end of my 12 month contract!~~~,Cornwall~~~,2016-04-01~~~,1,3,1,1

That star was a mistake.I contacted BT over a month ago to give plenty of time for them to sort my connection in my new build property . I told them the house was fibere but I was told BT won't know that until I order a phone line which I did 2 weeks later I had a call telling me it had been cancelled by open reach so I would have to put a fresh order in . So I did this an another 2weeks passed and I got a call saying it had been cancelled again. Next excuse was I was ringing the wrong department which just happened to be the same number ? This is still ongoing and I am in the property without phone or Internet  BT are the worst business I have ever had the misfortune to deal with . If you have the choice avoid them~~~,Didcot ~~~,2016-03-31~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have just returned to BT after many happy years with talk talk.. mainly because I wanted a cashback deal and a bt deal. I left BT originally because of the appalling service. My recent experiences tell me nothing has changed. They give dates for installation which they dont keep  the engineers dont know what systems they have to use i.e. They told me that they had no cable in my area and cancelled. The admin team told me they did so they reinstated my order. To cut  along story short I have no tv  no broadband and no landline as talk talk have now cancelled and BT cant do anything for anither week. I am 20 days past the original instllation date. Absolutely uselss~~~,York~~~,2016-03-30~~~,1,1,1,1
"So bad I'm assuming must be a joke.  Ironically after the latest delay with installation they said ""Don't worry ... we will call you back on 1 April"".   Ordered BT TV  internet (as well as the obligatory telephone line) 6 weeks ago.  Since then I have had 26 phone calls  15 hours of my life wasted  1 unexplained non-attendance by an engineer and 5 occasions having the Indian colleagues guys putting the phone down on me when they didn't know what to say. I STILL do not have television.  AND spent the last hour on the phone speaking to 4 different people to find out what was going on (3 of them couldn't).  The promise I will have TV tomorrow.  But they promised this on Tuesday but then sent me a text saying there was a technical fault  Without doubt one of the worst product / customer service experiences I have ever had anywhere in the world.~~~",London~~~,2016-03-30~~~,1,1,3,3
Thinking of switching to BT Broadband  DONT. I switched from Talk Talk due to slow speeds and poor customer service but believe me TalkTalk seems to be infinitely better than BT. Firstly we were left 1 week without internet connection at the switch. A very poor standard of call centre customer service officer told us that the problem was the Hub that they sent us. They sent a second which also didn't work so an engineer was called who got us up and running. It was not the hub at all. Unfortunately we now find that the speed is well below the TalkTalk speed we tried to move away from. The final irony is that our internet speed is so slow that we can't even run the BT speed tester!~~~,Bishops Stortford~~~,2016-03-29~~~,1,1,1,2
For me now BT is a synonym of horrible  I never have so many problems with any providers as with BT.I lived in several countries  used about 7 int. providers.But never  I mean never  had so many problems as with BTI have a contract with BT since 2011 in all those years random disconnects  speed drops  in all those years our property visit so many engineers that I lost my count.I think I had less girlfriends in all my life  then engineers visiting our property.And guess what  when I tried to cancel the contract  because I've had enough of...They said that's impossible unless I pay termination fees of 100 something.Sorry for my bad English!~~~,ILFORD~~~,2016-03-29~~~,1,2,2,1
Random disconnects happen far too often  even if I'm metres away from the hub. It can't be relied on. It took too long to find someone in customer support that actually cared. I seriously don't recommend.~~~,~~~,2016-03-28~~~,2,1,3,2

I moved house in January and took 2 weeks and many hours of phone calls to get my broadband infinity connected as the original order was cancelled but the new order was not put in by the customer service assistant  they then charged a £130 connection fee even though i was an existing customer and again several phone calls to get my money back. one of the calls lasted 2 hours and i was put through to 8 different people.   Absolutely appalling service. I am now trying to upgrade my TV package and have been informed there is a fault on my account. I was told last weekend after speaking to 3 different people that this would be fixed and I would be contacted but so far nothing. I phoned today to chase to be told that they needed to submit the fault again.  This was obviously ignored the first time. I will be phoning every day until this is resolved.  Hurry up Virgin Media in my area!~~~,Eastleigh~~~,2016-03-28~~~,1,1,5,5
I have recently found that my broadband speed was 0.5 Meg per sec. I made an effort to improve this by contacting BT. They informed me that I could get 9-15 MBPS. I then went through the process of upgrading and was told that this would be completed by 18.03.16. I called BT on 28.03.16 to find out where my new hub was and that I hadn't seen any improvement with my broadband speed. I was then told that I couldn't get anything better than 8MBPS. They also informed me that  there was no evidence of the order being place. I have wasted several hours of my time attempting to sort this out when it should have been quite an easy process. Also  why was I sold a package that can't be delivered?~~~,Albans House~~~,2016-03-28~~~,1,1,1,2
"Despite hearing all the horror stories of BT's terrible service I made the mistake of leaving sky for BT in the hope of getting better broadband speed. I ordered my package (BTinfinity and full tv bundle). Basically I seen a deal for BT package with 80mb infinity broadband. So I typed in my address and it said I could get infinity. So I went ahead and placed my order for 1 months time because I had to give sky 30 days cancellation notice. I had booked the BT to be installed on Monday 21st March  a week before this date the engineer would be calling out to the cabinet to hook me up to infinity. So before my engineer called out I just decided to log into myBT so see order progress if any and it said ""your order will be complete on Thursday 24th March"". So I contacted them and they said it had been changed to 24th  nice of them to not email and let me know this. I was also not even able to track the progress because it just keeps saying an error occurred. So anyway my sky ended and because BT were going to be 3 days later than I booked I was going to be without any phone/internet or tv service for 3 days. Then on Thursday 24th the phoneline came back online but no internet. I contacted them and after numerous times on hold and being blatantly hung up on I was told that the internet order had been canceled due to ""a mismatch in reference ID""  which apparently means the cabinet the engineer called out to has the old copper connector which can't be used for infinity  the girl said I might not be able to get infinity and they would update me on Tuesday 29th March (my semidetached next door neighbor has infinity and used the same cabinet so seems odd). Keep in mind the only reason I switched from sky was because I was told I could get infinity  which in my mind is basically false advertising. So I am without internet for over a week so far and not knowing what service I will eventually end up paying for.~~~",Northern Ireland~~~,2016-03-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst service ever. Never had issues with sky. Router is rubbish - you cannot pick up a signal after a few metres  cannot use another router withit  tied to rubbish bt dns that keeps failing and technical support blame it on router or your computer  when it is obvious it is the bt dns that has gone down and then after lengthy phone call and escalation they finally admit the issue is at there end. Speed is on par with dial up on a bt infinity 1 contract with no fibre running into home... so no fibre only copper! MISSOLD! Then you call to log faults and they lie that it has been raised when it actually has not. WORST EXPERIENCE EVER! ANYONE THINKING OF MOVING TO BT - DON'T - YOU WILL REGRET IT! THEY LIE AND CHEAT CUSTOMERS!~~~,Ilford~~~,2016-03-27~~~,1,1,1,1
We placed an order several weeks ago for broadband. 2 days after we moved into our new house  still no broadband so we called BT. They told us to wait a few more days  then they would call us. No call after a few days - they'd tricked us into waiting longer so our '14 day opt out period' had expired. We now cannot leave as we are 'contractually bound' to use BT now. Still no broadband  2 weeks later. We're still paying for the service. Unable to cancel. We've been disconnected from the online chat by them as soon as we mention we have a complaint! We've been promised a phone call in 4 days - as if that's going to happen! We still haven't been told what the problem is. I've never had such bad service in my life as with BT.~~~,King's Lynn~~~,2016-03-26~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT now for two years first year was good broad band speeds brill then renewed my contract and that is where the problems started speeds keep dropping can not keep the speeds I have even emailed bt openreach executive  and they are not helpful at all went to the ombudsman and they fell on BT side even my MP was a waste of space have sort legal advice and told cant do much but start a twitter campaign might get BT openreach to do something~~~,London~~~,2016-03-25~~~,1,1,1,1
I changed providers from Talk Talk to BT Infinity 2. BIG MISTAKE. Their claims of up to 76mb is utter rubbishy and was not even able to get half of that.  It's all a scam. They blame it on old cables or aluminium cables from the cabinet but won't invest in upgrading this infrastructure.  So basically  it's lump it or like it.  Don't waste your time with BT. Come back TALK TALK  all is forgiven. Wish Virgin were in my area.~~~,North Wales~~~,2016-03-25~~~,1,1,1,1
