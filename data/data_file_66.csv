"Changed from standard BT to ""fast"" Infinity a few months ago. Immediately slower  and in contrast to phone salesman's statement that the ""deal"" would cost the same  I got taken off a cheap evening rate to a cheap weekend rate only. Online support was friendly and helpful  but ultimately it made no difference to low speed despite two complaints. Line reliability seemed to fall slightly. Luckily  it doesn't affect me too badly  but it annoys visitors.~~~",London ~~~,2015-05-05~~~,1,2,1,3
BT is the worst internet broadband I have ever seen and the speed is very very poor and all other broadbands are better and faster and I will never recommend BT to anyone~~~,london~~~,2015-05-04~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Appalling customers service from the moment I upgraded my package in Nov 2014. Mistake after mistake  given the wrong information regarding my gift card. Had to raise two complaints with BT both of which said no to gift card  then when I raised with ombudsman suddenly BT listened to my calls and oh after all I was entitled to my voucher. This process took approx 3 months to sort.  My account was also set up incorrectly and I was billed for services I had cancelled then my monthly direct debit plan wasn't set up and I ended up on a quarterly plan having over £200 taken out without warning as my account had been set up on paperless billing (I hadn't requested this).  As a result of this I have now accumulated a large debit balance on my account. In several occasion I have come home to find my service disconnected without receiving any warning. Every time I ring I end up having a very lengthy conversation and am assured that if I set up an agreement to pay of the outstanding balance by July then my services will not be affected actin. Despite this my services have still been disconnected without warning despite me keeping to the agreement. Each time a lengthy call to BT has been involved. The customer service I had received has been dreadful from start to finish. I have requested that my package be cancelled but it appears BT can treat their customers however they like but they still have no right to cancel as they are under contact. What about BTs contract to provide me with good customer service.?  At no point have I received an apology or an offer of compensation for the time I have had to waste as a result of the poor service I have received from BT.  I am currently in the process of looking into the matter with the assistance of OFCOM and the ombudsman.  I will make my views known in appropriate services because to be honest I have heard the same complaints from many other people. I certainly won't be recommending BT or using them again. The end of my contact can't come soon enough!~~~,Sonerset~~~,2015-05-02~~~,1,1,3,3
Terrible broadband  got worse and worse over 6 months until it totally stopped. Que the start of a week of phonecalls to india  struggling in vain to get my point across and being asked to carry out the same trouble shooting steps again and again. Eventually they conceded I needed a new home hub and asked for £45 for the privilege or a 12 month renewal  well that wasn't going to happen I'm pleased to get away. this was the 2 time something like this has happened with BT and I won't be giving them another chance.~~~,essex~~~,2015-05-01~~~,1,1,1,1

I needed to close my account as we had an eviction notice and we are all leaving the house (which needs workings and no one else will live there).The account is in my name but was shared by 4 people and is too expensive for me to move it. I called 2 times asking how much I would've faced to stop the contract earlier and I've been told £30  both times. Based on that I took my decision and called the third time to close it. Surprisingly I've been asked £93  from an advisor that started to explain how stupid I was to leave BT  checking my private usage  and not being helpful at all. I closed and called on another moment. I was asked £130 this time. I asked to speak to a manager to explain the situation but my request was denied. I opened an official complain and received an email which told me they would've call me back in 48  maximum 96 hours.After 144 hours nobody has got in contact with me. Who called  instead  was the office for payments as I cancelled the direct debit.He put me through other 3 people  one of them was more like a robot than a person  not able to conversate with me  since I finally closed the account. Now I face a massive bill for an house where there are not people living in and where I cannot even access anymore.  BT makes you a fool  doesn't care about the situation  and has not will to help you in any way.~~~,London~~~,2015-04-30~~~,1,~~~,5,3
Took a new contract with BT as moved to a new area. Previously with virgin media who were excellent. No virgin media services in new area. 3 weeks into bt contract  affinity 1   signal drops all the time  loss of internet  takes ages to watch or download anything  upon contacting them went through all the relevant checks on the phone and told all is working as it should. It is not! Absolute crap   and now stuck in a contract that does not deliver what it states on the tin! There are so many unhappy customers on here.... Bt need to pull their act together. What can we do as consumers please  there must be more that we can do.~~~,hampshire~~~,2015-04-29~~~,1,2,1,1
Pathetic  criminal organisation that constantly lays on 'late payment' charges by ensuring your bill doesn't reach you until AFTER its due date  absolutely none of the advertised 'switch to paperless' benefits received  at best intermittent service  paying for 40Meg  funnily enough never have over 14Meg unless there's an engineer sat in the building when it mystically reaches 31/32. Absolute rubbish  utterly criminal. Can't believe I have to switch mobile supplier too now as their monopoly continues to grow.~~~,"Farnham, Surrey~~~",2015-04-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"BT-ARE-ATROCIOUS. It took BT two months to install infinity broadband in my house. Once it was installed it was good  it could handle four reasonably heavy users without slowing the speed. Unfortunately...the honeymoon period ended after 2 months....Broadband light went red. Been onto customer service multiple times  they have no clue....""have you checked the wires are connected?""......this question is the limits of their fault diagnosis. ""Sir  the line will be live by 6pm the next day""......nope.....""I'm sorry Sir  it may take a bit longer  please reset your box by midnight tomorrow when the line will be live""......nope....""I will send an engineer out to look at your connection  he will arrive on Tuesday between 8am - 1pm""..........nope.......""I'm sorry  I noted down your contact mobile number down wrong  the engineer could't contact you on Tuesday"".....but nobody has knocked...""An engineer will be out on Friday to fix your line"".....I'm losing the will to live here. I don't think he is coming on Friday and even if he does he is only going to check that I've plug in the box and connected the internet cable. I wish I had plusnet in my life right now  yes they may not be as fast but they were damn good are providing an internet connection which is something I value highly with my internet provider. I genuinely cannot wait to celebrate the day when BT are out of my life. Godspeed.~~~",Cheltenham~~~,2015-04-28~~~,1,1,5,1
Avoid BT at all cost for your Broadband.I echo the majority of the below reviews. Intermitten connection  no connection  slow speeds when actually connected.Tried in vein over 5+ hours worth of calls to resolve and rectify. Transferred from department to department and technical explaining the same issue to different people with nobody able to know how to fix the problem. No call backs  no resolution  just a complete pain in the backside. Love the adverts at the moment about being the most reliable  surely they should be brought to justice under false advertising.~~~,Leeds~~~,2015-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1
"I went with BT in July of last year  with fibre new in my area  I was keen to upgrade to superfast broadband. I went with BT  because I thought SKY needed some competition  and was keen to see the rugby. Almost immediately  it performed worse than SKY which was on snail broadband 5Mb. The internet programs were impossible to watch in HD and only just passable (sometimes). I called their helpline and was told that they would send an engineer  but if my equipment was faulty they would charge me £120. I told them politely that a contract works both ways and if they did not send an engineer FOC  I would cancel my contract. Success  they said they would send an engineer FOC. Well after giving me a two hour window for the engineer 7.00am to 9.00am  he still managed to be 20 minutes late. He took out his little tv gadget device and plugged it into the input. ""Your signal is good"" he says. ""What is the problem then?"" I ask. ""I don't know"" he says. "" I thought you were an engineer"" says I  "" it must be the BT box then  can you test it?"". ""no  sorry"" he says.As you can imagine this engineer  isn't an engineer at all  he is someone of the street  given a box and shown how to plug it in. After several unsuccessful phone calls  I decided to unplug my BT box and watch HD channels on my old SKY box. Although I cannot watch BT sport  it worked out OK  because Leicester Tigers had a crap year and lost most of their games anyway. Its an ill wind that blows no good at all :-).~~~",Leicester~~~,2015-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1

Infinity was all easy enough to understand and set up but proved to drop out more frequently than the old BT router. I decided I wanted to switch back to it but two emails sent within the allowable cancellation time went unanswered and unacknowledged. Left me feeling frustrated and annoyed. Not sure yet where I'm going with it. Naturally one can't extrapolate from my experience to generalise about the service but I hope it will make some thinking of going for Infinity learn more about it than I did  before jumping.P.s. Ironically the 'webpage wasn't available' when I tried to submit this review!~~~,Faringdon~~~,2015-04-25~~~,2,~~~,2,~~~

Since we upgrade to BT infinity the broadband internet connection became worst. On our old package it has been slightly faster than infinity which doesn't sound normal at all. The connection speed always seems to become insanely slower from time to time. With the older package it didn't do this as much.~~~,Hutton Rudby~~~,2015-04-22~~~,1,1,1,1
BT have been absolutely Rubbish. I made the order before i moved home  when we got to our new home  they was no landline or broadband. I had to reorder and wait 11 days. I need internet and landline for my work. Eventually I got it and for compensation they offered me £3. I spend more money on petrol to go to and internet cafe. DONT USE BT GO TO ANOTHER PROVIDER.~~~,Bovington Dorset~~~,2015-04-21~~~,1,3,1,2
Where do I start  BT are a complete shambles. I only live just outside of a major town but the best they can give me is 2 meg. I dont want to pay more for FTC as I think this will be crap as well. At present the superb technological giant of BT can manage to deliver is 0.5m. I have had endless calls to their customer help desk  a singular example of an oxymoron if ever there was one. I have had visits from engineers  I have had new routers  in the end somebody at BT with an IQ bigger than their hat size could work out that its their stupid copper phone line we might get somewhere. Unfortunately they seem to busy escalating it to another team who wont call you at the agreed time and even worse will still not do anything about the issue.  I think we couls all club together and send the CEO of BT a torch and a mirror because thats the only way he/she could find there own backside.~~~,Blackburn~~~,2015-04-19~~~,1,1,1,1

"This is what i had to say to Bt myself - ""So for the past 6 months  our internet service was terrible  we called your people about 50 times throughout this entire 6 months  and it had absolutely no effect on the performance of our internet and throughout time it has only gone worse. They've tried everything from resetting the hub to changing settings of the hub  to last resort of changing the entire hub  only to find out that its not the hub that's at fault its actually your service. It is not only wifi  it is the main line itself  as not only every single device in the house that uses wifi (even the new tablet i purchased the other day) but whatever connection that's coming from the mains it is terrible  because the stability is the worst i've had out of any internet service provider and i will definitely be switching to Sky or virgin after our contract runs out  i mean this is absolutely outrageous  the internet itself is not always at top speed  there are rare cases and times when the internet speed works at a speed that can't even be said to be satiable  the number of times the connection drops is probably more than the number of grain of sand there is at the beach;  within this last 1 and a half years. I've absolutely had it with Bt. They've given me no compensation  when asked for help they were of no use and made no difference to the connection speed  only by chance there was one case out of the 50 times i've called them that the internet speed went up by 1m/b on the speed test and the guy went all happy  only later during that day the speed dropped by 5mb  and during most of the time the internet speed is the absolute worst  i mean i can't even load a simple youtube video  or in most cases the internet just stops working  i get the screen ""no connection"" on my browser  and this is not only my computer  like i said  there's about 4 of us in our family  each of us owns at least two devices and we all drop connection when this happens  now you may say that it may be due to the traffic in our own house  well here's another thing  even when they gave us a new hub the other day  this means that most of the devices weren't registered to it  i did a speed check and it was as awful as it was before  and there's no way i can stand this terrible internet. Like i said  its not even about the speed most of the time  its about how unstable it is  the internet connection just drops and some times it takes a solid 30-45 mins before it is back and i have to say this is absolutely not worth a single penny considering i'm paying 54 pound a month which is outrageous as i can easily get google fibre with that money and that can go to speed of up to 1gbps  i don't know if this is with every area or just my area or everywhere else in the country  but i know one thing  that Bt internet is the absolute worst i've ever had and i never plan to go back to it  one of the biggest mistakes of my life.

bt landline was faulty in october 2014  called the customer service center  they said will send an engineer to fix it  did not say they will charge me  i think it is part of BT service  engineer came 2 days later  he came in  put his tool bags on the floor  and then  his phone was ringing  he answered the phone  i knew he is talking about his private thing after few seconds  guess what  he was talking on the phone for more than 30 mins. he said may be the cable is worn (he did not say why)  he said need replace new cable  i said i had a spare cable(i have 2 lines before  cancelled one)  he just rewire the spare cable to the socket  then did something in the BT greenbox  then it is done  he spent no longer then 15 mins. i received a bill it is 445 pound  115 for the engineer call out 330 for his work  110 pound an hour!!!  i also need pay him talking phone  it is ridiculous.~~~,north finchley~~~,2015-04-15~~~,1,1,1,1

Fail  fail  fail. According to BT  Openreach was to blame (not BT!) when we requested our new house be connected. 2 weeks in  we await a case review in 2 weeks time to tell us when we might get connected. Told it could be up to 5 months  despite being the last house on the development. We rely on this for work as well as leisure. Time to end their outdated monopoly. Will change providers as soon as current contract ends. No means to complain to Openreach directly.~~~,Norfolk ~~~,2015-04-13~~~,1,1,1,1
i had been with BT for 4 months  and have had so much hassle and stress with Customer Service reps in all parts of the world. Engineers turning up to my properties under the influence of a Class B drug. also non stop on the phone with Managers not being able to resolve my issues and troubles with their services 1. Bt Broadband on and off - had 4 engineers out to assist couldn't fix the problem to then find out that they hadnt activated my line!!!! then they couldn't refund me the days weeks i had no internet~!!!!! i could go on for ever about BT bad service but would just advise news customers to not go with them and look further. i payed £281.98 pence to cancel their services and was ask to send back there equipment which was shambolic considering i had to pay for installation and the delivery p&p fee!!!!!!!~~~,~~~,2015-04-13~~~,~~~,~~~,2,~~~
I went from Virgin to BT and I have regretted it ever since. I can't wait for my contract to expire so I can get my broadband from somewhere else. My broadband speed has gone from 31Mb/s to 400kb/s. BT Sport is absolutely appalling. There is no catchup option online and you cannot pause online coverage. This is unacceptable compared to all other TV providers. Not that it makes much difference as the picture is so terrible  it's unwatchable. I am not new to this. I have been watching online TV since it was first developed and I was a part of the test recipients for both the BBC iPlayer and 4OD  and BT Sport is worse then both of these even in their development stages all those years ago. There is no point in complaining to BT  they simply don't care.~~~,Staffordshire~~~,2015-04-11~~~,1,1,1,1
We orderd BT infinity at start of March. As we were existing customers we were given a dearer price than a new customer  but our problem which BT knew about from the installation   was our slow broadband speed. It was incredibly difficult to make myself understood when I complained and the person would promise to phone back at a certain time and date and then never phoned.  We had a second engineer in to check the line  although I had succinctly explained the problem was with our distance away from the fibre.  And then although the second engineer had told my husband exactly the same as the first engineer I had not contact with the complaints department until I again phoned 10 days later.  I have now agreed to continue paying the same price for downloading 9Mb and uploading 0.2Mb although the speeds I was quoted were download 18 -25mb and uploading 3.2-5.0Mb.~~~,Fishcross~~~,2015-04-09~~~,1,1,1,2
I initially ordered on 23rd August 2014  received hub on 11th September.Told by email that I'd cancelled my order and needed to return the hub and that I'd placed a new order both on 13th September. Phoned customer services who struggled to understand  possibly due to language barrier  but was told to return the hub and would receive a new one  which was exactly the same as the old one. Next I received an email with a engineer time slot that was blank. Eventually broadband started on 1st october  2 weeks after agreed start date  causing considerable inconvenience.   While broadband speed is good  the hub needs reset every 1-2 days.  Would not recommend  and will not be continuing contract.~~~,dumfries~~~,2015-04-09~~~,1,1,4,1
We moved to a new build development in Oxford and had no choice but to go with BT for broadband as Virgin Media did not have permission by the developers to install cable even though there is 100 Mb Vigin media cable upto the entrance of our complex. We struggled for months to just get our phone line and broadband connected by BT. When it was finally connected (only after escalating to their high level complaints team)  we immediately had a fault after less than a week. We had a number of short intermittent faults and now we have yet another major fault a month or so later. Their call centres are no help at all and we just get told the fault will be fixed within 48 hours. I was previously with Virgin Media and had a considerably more reliable service with a fault every 5 years or so instead of every month and usually fixed with 5 hours rather than 48...~~~,Oxford~~~,2015-04-05~~~,1,1,3,1
Im so unimpressed with BT and beating my head against a wall  I struggle to even go through it all again. Customer service really is a shambles where you constantly have to re-explain . it always 'my' fault even tho it isnt Briefly got fiber at 70/20. In january 2015 BT started work replacing my cabinet (which they are still doing in April) when they did this my speed dropped to 35/3. Repeated calls to offshore idiots who as me to check cable. An engineer came out who told me yes I had a fault - went to cabinet to patch me into a different port - called me to say hes leaving it because the cabinet is a mess... BT dont seem to record any information so next person I speak to asks me if I have checked my cables!!!! This went on and on until I said if Im getting slow connection I'll just pay £25 a month instead of £45. I can only do that if I sign a twelve month contract .. OK signed up with SKY (I know sky will use the same line - but I wont be paying for 70M and getting 40). Final joke is they keep contacting me asking why Im leaving. If they had any kind of system they could look at the 8 calls I've made and 20 people I've spoken to to figure that out!!~~~,Elland~~~,2015-04-05~~~,1,1,1,1

We have to get an engineer out now £120 !!! Even though we havnt been with them a year and we have complained on many occasions.. Awful service and the call centre is crap they struggle with English.

I had been a loyal customer for many years and then when things went wrong I had a massive bill and when I complained their belligerent arrogant customer service dept told me that i had miss used their service! (as if anyone would pay a fee to avoid extra charges would then go and mss use the service) So after complaining in writing I wrote and told then that I was going to a reputable communication company and accused BT of obtaining money by deception  which they ignored I have been a happy user with VM and have broadband at 50Mb that is great for my Apple kit so don't even think about going to BT you will regret it.~~~,Bristol~~~,2015-04-04~~~,1,~~~,1,1

During the 5 years on BT Broadband We have experienced many problems. If you have a fault with your phoneline expect them to take at least a month so send out  3 clueless engineers to run tests and tell you the phoneline is fine until a smart one comes along and fixes it. If your problem is anything other than a phoneline fault then good luck my friend because I've had unstable/unusable internet for the past 4 months with no end in sight. I think they've sent around 10 engineers to our door and they've just told us that is isn't their problem.~~~,Wales~~~,2015-04-01~~~,1,1,1,1
