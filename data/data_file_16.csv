Complete ****. Got kicked off 8 times in 2 hours. Never works. Complained multiple times and they don't do anything. Get sky~~~,Sheffield ~~~,2018-09-03~~~,1,2,2,1
First the positive- The broadband speed was fine and the service was reliable about 95% of the time.  And that is the only good thing I can say. the customer service is APPALLING. I have wasted hours of my life trying to get seemingly simple things sorted out. Firstly they changed the installation dates 3 times  the final time without telling me leading to costs being incurred through the previous provider (they changed it 3 days early  leading to a penalty fine from the previous provider for still being in contract). Then they didn't transfer my number. And told me they couldn't because. [insert whichever lie they decided to tell that day]. Seriously  no 2 people ever gave me the same answer as to why I had lost my phone number. Including one person who said it was impossible to even have the number! A surprise to us  as it had been our number for 3 years.... After 3 months of complaining they gave me £20 in compensation!! Then it took 9months for them to give me the award card I was owed. Because their system was wrong. You have no idea how frustrating it is being told you're wrong  when you have an email FROM BT telling me I was in fact correct. The final straw was when they raised the prices. this gave me a way to get out of my contract without a penalty and STILL they are screwing me around.  Nothing is ever easy. Everytime I contacted them I had to speak to multiple people  who would all open new complaints rather than deal with the one already open. Or insist on closing a complaint that wasn't fixed. With a few exceptions the support staff I dealt with were rude  at best incompetent and on more than one occasion lied to me. AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS. If you have no problems you will probably be OK  but even minor problems will probably take weeks if not months to sort out.~~~,London~~~,2018-08-31~~~,1,1,3,3
Just shocking all round. Poor speeds  unreliable connection  poor customer service... the list goes on. BT under the misapprehension they still have a broadband monopoly. Off to Vodafone.~~~,London~~~,2018-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
The most disgraceful customer service ever. All the staff are ridiculously unhelpful and have done nothing but make our lives miserable for the past 3 months. The internet did not work for 3 months and every time we called for help either someone was misleading  the staff lied or hung up during the middle of the call. Appalling service and internet connection. This company should be ashamed of the name they have built for themselves as so many people are complaining about them and so many unhappy customers. We have been lied to and spent most evenings on the phone to customer service instead of relaxing at home with the family. Tragic company and customer service. Would not recommend BT to anyone as they take you money and provide you nothing. After 14 years of being their customer I am shocked by what we have experienced.  Absolutely horrendous.~~~,Windsor~~~,2018-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Literally furious. Why  why on earth do they exist to cause such misery. The worst steaming pile of overpriced horsemuck. The connection is terrible  their custom services are useless. Their website is always under maintenance when I sign in to try pay a bill  their Indian call centre is so frustrating im done. Going to set fire to their equipment and walk away. STAY Away from BT.~~~,Cranfield~~~,2018-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible  the so called 'off shore' Team should be abandoned and technical support brought back to this Country  they are blatant liars and completely incompetent  say they will call back and never do  falsify their tickets with lies  disgusting.~~~,Lichfield~~~,2018-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling service.  Ryan was so rude and difficult to work with.~~~,Australia~~~,2018-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Was only with these cowboys for less then 2 week. They had me on the wrong package so called to tell them which they assured me would be sorted and someone would call me back after 2 days  no phone call so called again to be told sorry nothing has been done and we have no idea something had to be. They did nothing at all on the phone but did cut me off  so I called back and cancelled which they didn’t even hesitate to do. Now I’m without internet and have transferred back to Virgin. STAY away from BT  absolutely poor customer service.~~~,Bradford~~~,2018-08-28~~~,1,1,1,1
"After being with TT for many years of trouble free service. I got a call out of the blue from a BT telesales person  who basically lied to me that I would save a lot of money by switching to BT  which I fell for. What a mistake  it was never the price that was given to me  we couldn't receive incoming calls for 6 weeks  which they couldn't explain or fix  no matter how many times I called their useless helpline. After being with them for several months  the set top box would only tune to Welsh TV channels  which was permanent  no matter how many times it was retuned. The helpline is useless  their only advice was to retune the box  or it was the TV aerial  I told them I had retuned it 10 times or more  and it was a new aerial  then to be told "" I don't know what we're going to do "". The final straw came when after 8 months they notified me that my bill was to be increased by £25 per month. This was just for a basic service. I cancelled my direct debit and just lately I have been receiving letters from a debt collecting agency  demanding substantially more than a months BT payment plus 25 percent what BT added for administrative cost. DONT USE BT THEY ARE A LYING THEIVING JOKE.~~~",liverpool~~~,2018-08-28~~~,~~~,1,1,1
"I had a website built by BT. They tied me up in a contract  the contract ended but I continued to pay and use their services. I transferred the service and they continued to charge. I cancelled and had to cancel via two separate departments and they refused to refund any money due to not informing them.  It turned out that I was paying £36 a month for ""management fees"" that I did not need at all so BT have earned very nicely indeed! I have also been paying £24 every quarter for hosting and required only hosting after the 1st year. So yes BT was charging me £42 a month when I should have been paying only £6 a month. When I phoned BT to cancel and BT said they want more money as notice is required - I said I will pay but will let everyone know what the BT Corporation is like (she said ""you are more than welcome to do that"" ). So they are on... BT gave me an 0800 number that linked to my mobile number but did not get missed calls or any answerphone. So I missed out on customers. BT gave me email addresses linked to my domain but was not able to setup the password and server details to access the emails. So missed out on any emails sent to my advertised email addresses. This was an ongoing issue with many calls. BT deleted all my emails on their servers once I had transferred the hosting although I was still paying. BT put the phone down on me when I asked them to look into whether they could retrieve my emails on their servers (I know because they did not call back). This is expected as I am a leaving customer. BT purchased EE and without delay Orange's reputation was gone  their customer service went down hill  trying to worm out of warranties and prices hiked. BT said the website they created me was terrible and I needed to upgrade to £150 a month from £36. A year later when I made inquiries they said that the company they used is no longer trading and I did not get the upgrade at all  so they refunded the money back dated. In summary: BT are too large  too controlling  too financially focused and uncaring towards its customers. They have the money for large advertising campaigns  to buy other companies out and to perfect contract terms/conditions to their advantage. They don't have the necessary knowledge to assist you with technical issues. In fact I think a small claims court may get me several years of management fees back as they have never been used. I will report back how that pans out. I beg you to not use BT and to inform your family/friends to avoid like the plague. Thank you. Together we can make a difference. Are you still considering BT? Think I may be unlucky one customer? BT charged me an additional £5 a month to have ""itemised bills"" that had nothing to itemise. I phoned to cancel and ask for a refund and they said ""no it is your responsibility to cancel it even though you did not set it up"". BT (Be There).~~~",London~~~,2018-08-27~~~,1,1,1,1
BT have an OK broadband speed  this is not just me but other people I have spoken to. However they also have a very poor customer service  and broadband reliability is something which almost doesn’t exist when you’re with BT. Internet randomly shuts off  currently using my mobile data to write this review because the internet shut off again would you believe it or not. Wouldn’t recommend  go for Virgin Media instead.~~~,Don’t ~~~,2018-08-26~~~,~~~,2,3,~~~
Very disappointed. Worked well for 9 months then problem after problem and poor customer service. Helpful and polite people but sent around the houses. Ie told what I wanted to hear. We think problem is router. One will be with you in 48hrs. Someone then tells me order was cancelled. Another tells me it was never ordered. No Wi-fi for weeks. A member of staff hung up on me on live chat. No I want rude. Told today problem was with my devices ie suggesting I ring 6 manufacturers and complain to them.~~~,Torquay~~~,2018-08-24~~~,1,1,~~~,1
"Signed up for 18 month contract and Paying for SUPERFAST FIBRE Advertised Average speed is 50Mb. Only getting 0.01Mbs!! phoned the call centre and they say my guaranteed speed is only 0.5Mbs!!!. They said it said this in the small print on the contract and laughed at me saying "" Ha Ha Ha.. You did not read the small print"" upgrade to the fastest service  I am already paying for the fastest service available  why am I being charged for premium service and getting slower than dialup? I work from home and can't work  it very frustrating and my employer is not impressed I could lose my job over this.I have spent 12+ hours trying to be understood by a foreign call centre. They won't do anything to try and help me BT don't care if I loose my job over this!!!~~~",Antrim~~~,2018-08-24~~~,1,1,1,1
May I never go back to BT ever! I am asking for one simple change to take place and it has resulted in a ful 1-2 month saga with so much emotional hassle!  The broadband and reliability as a standard are great. The customer service is not.  I do not and may not ever return back to BT. I am a long time serving customer who has now lost so much money in bills loopholes and bad customer service. I do not and will not ever from now on recommend ever trying their service. No matter how much incentive they will give in Amazon discounts. I am too disgusted by their treatment of one simple request.~~~,UK~~~,2018-08-23~~~,1,1,4,4
I have three problems which have not yet been resolved although I have contacted customer service +20 times. No help from online chat or when phoning customer service.1. BT sent an engineer to install internet and BT TV. The engineer installed internet but not BT TV. I did that myself and cannot get all the channels I was promised. 2. It is not possible to activate BT ID which is necessary to pay invoices. I was asked to give a security question - my mother's maiden name - when I ordered BT that would later be used to activate BT ID. When I am asked my mother's maiden name they say it is the wrong answer - I know my mother's maiden name.3. When the engineer was in my home to install internet and BT TV he damaged the walls  two clearly visible  medium sized spots on the paint on the wall. I have made a complaint and received no reaction or remedy. Dont order BT internet/TV.~~~,Oxford~~~,2018-08-23~~~,1,1,4,4
Bt are an absolute disgrace  3 weeks waiting for a refund  told I would get a call back almost daily  still not sorted  customer service is next to non  there's been 2 advisors out of all of them I've spoke to that have actually tried to help. Getting through to someone that knows what they are talking about is a mission in itself. Very unhappy ex customer!~~~,West midlands~~~,2018-08-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Had a great service until after 2 years with broadband the contract ends and I end up getting charged £50  for 2 months in a row.  It was really nice for BT to tell me the contract would be ending and I would need to give them notice before leave. Absolutely appalling! I would recommend them highly before this happened  but I will not be returning in the future!~~~,Sheffield~~~,2018-08-22~~~,1,1,5,5
What a total waste of time Bt are the business disruption is absolute top notch. From getting the addresses wrong to not actually turning up or phoning anyone to let us know that they are not coming even after waiting all morning. The engineer could not even ring. I could go on forever. Our new phone system will never be in and working. Incompetent company. That is only interested in signing the contract. It is now stopping the move to new premises.

"BT are without any shadow of a doubt the WORST company of any of the telephony provides. Their customer service is SHOCKING  we tried to cancel our domestic line  they incorrectly cut off our business line and broadband. We are a retail business and could not take card payments for a week. To cap it all they tried to charge us to reconnect even after they admitted it was their error and tried to tell us we were in a new contract as a result. They really shouldn't have the name ""British"" in their title  they are a disgrace to this country. Ive had to spend countless hours on the phone to them  and with their overseas call centres getting anything done is nigh on impossible  assuminy you can actually understand the person you are talking to. I will be ditching BT business in favour of Virgin Media business (I have Virgin Media at home now)  they may not be perfect but they are a darn sight better than BT~~~",Hertford~~~,2018-08-21~~~,1,1,5,5
I have been with BT Broadband since FTTC became available in 2015. I have no complaints at all. Performance has been fast and rock solid  although I have been using my own router rather than the BT HUb. Customer service has been very good (by phone and on-line chat). The cost is on the high side but I am reluctant to switch to cheaper and probably worse competitors. One last point  this is an honest review of my experience with  BT as a customer. I have no oher relationship with the company.~~~,Essex~~~,2018-08-20~~~,5,5,5,5
BT Broadband- The Worst Customer service I’ve ever Experienced. I signed up for BT TV and broadband having recently moved house.  The installation was meant to be free but they charged me £59. Called to complain and was told the refund would be in my account within 24 hours. One week later had to call again as still no refund. Finally got that money back a few days later.  On the day the installation was due to happen I didn’t receive any communication so checked online and it showed the engineer was confirmed.  Just to be sure I used instant chat and was told the same thing. The time slot came and went and the engineer never showed. Called to complain and was told they didn’t know if I needed a new line so rather than check or ask they just cancelled the appointment I had waited 6 weeks for.  Decided 3 complaint calls was enough before even getting the service so decided to cancel the contract. It then took a further 4 x 30min+ calls over 3 days for them to actually cancel.  Two weeks on I still haven’t received my refund for the engineer cost and have been charged a bill for a service I never received. Another two hours on the phone and many promises made and I’m still waiting for a refund.  I’m sure the service is great if you ever get it but if you have a problem forget about it because no-one there seems to be able to help. They are very apologetic and all promise to help but they all blame the processes or the systems and there doesn’t seem to be any joined up thinking between departments.~~~,Bridgend ~~~,2018-08-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Our whole experience with BT has been terrible 6 weeks to get connected  countless calls to customer service  been on hold for countless minutes 55 minutes one day!!

TV package is a joke wish we had stayed with sky~~~,Wokingham ~~~,2018-08-19~~~,1,1,1,1

It took years for this company to learn the lesson of having UK based call centres. Now it needs to stop spending vast sums on t.v.  advertising computerised answer systems and its preoccupation with the idea that all the customer wants is to watch sport especially soccer. This company needs to invest in PEOPLE. To improve the dismal customer care they currently provide.I simply want to ring up  talk to a human who can provide the information or help required or connect me with another human who can.Unfortunately that would require an outbreak of common sense and upset the share-holders.The company is  however  extremely adept when increasing the price of service.This no doubt makes the share-holders happy and profits can be spent on adverts to avoid over-taxation.There must be better out there...~~~,Uk~~~,2018-08-15~~~,1,1,5,5
I  left sky to move to bt only because I wanted bt sports for the champions league and sky was not offering that service. It like leaving an ok relationship in search for a better one but instead find yourself in a worse relationship but u can not leave because of the kids. In this case bt is bad relationship and the contract is the kids. The customer service team is really poor at their job. I woke up this morning with my services down  I phone in and the first adviser I spoke with hang the call off because I asked him to give me 5 minuets to find my customer number  when I phone back in to explain what I went through with the first customer service advisor he didn’t stop to think that I am not happy but better still talk over me. I then tried to explain that I make arrangements to clear up my account on Friday 17th August he went in confrontation mode saying my account was blocked because I didn’t pay my bills and the extension time slot is 7days. I tried to make him understand that bt customer service team is really poor at their job just by everything I experienced that I can’t recommend anyone to bt. This isn’t the first time. It is the fourth times this happening the first three was my internet being very slow but for every time when I call back in to cancel my services I will speak to one of the good once I was asked to upgrade my service. Right now I can only take enough if this continues  my only option is to leave and for me personally I won’t recommend anyone to use this service.~~~,SHEFFIELD  SOUTH YORKSHIRE~~~,2018-08-15~~~,1,~~~,2,1
On 6th of July a month in advance I made a call to bt customer service and asked to close my account and stop providing services when my contract ends which is 6th. Bt guy said that my contract ends on 15th of August  I asked to confirm that I won't be charged any extra money and I will be refunded £43 because I'm paying upfront  and the BT guy confirmed that is correct. Now turns out BT guy was lying  I still have BT service and I was charged £58 and not refunded !!!~~~,Ilford~~~,2018-08-15~~~,2,1,3,3
It's just rubbish my previous provider was so much better  in fact my non fibre broadband was more reliable.BT haven't come up with a reason and despite this and whilst I'm paying £33 per month they have the cheek to tell me last month that they are to increase my  Monthly fee.Ha ha Don't do not.. Plusnet way better.~~~,Ayr~~~,2018-08-14~~~,1,1,2,2
I didn't get past the first hurdle with BT. I called them  as a potential new customer  to just enquire about a deal. I found a deal that suited me  but emphasised I would not make a commitment before I had a chance to think. Foolishly I gave my address  phone number and email  but happily no bank details. Soon after I had emails showing I had an account and a start date. I thought this was wrong as I had not agreed to this  but thought I would go with this  any way. The start date didn't suit me  so I called to change it. It took them 52 minutes to answer  by which time I was seething. I decided if this is typical customer service then I would cancel the order  that I had not agreed to. Bad way to treat people BT and I'll have nothing to do with your dodgy business practices!~~~,Birmingham~~~,2018-08-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Very poor customer service as they insist they sent a letter regarding 2018 September price rises.As I am greater than 30 days since letter was sent I cannot cancel my contract.This was the same senario the last time BT INCREASED its prices.Funny how these letters are very in portal but are not sent recorded delivery.What a joke.~~~,Lincoln~~~,2018-08-12~~~,1,1,4,4

"Absolutely disgusting. I was having connection and speed issues with my old provider ""NOW TV""  and was promised the world if i moved to BT. What i signed up for was BT infinity with all calls just as NOW TV at supposedly £38.00 per month.  What i got was a huge bill in the first month for calls made to Poland which they failed to include in my mi-sold package. The usual messing around online and on the phone persued  and they then had to increased my package price to £45.00 (naughty naughty)  to include the international calls which NOW TV actually provided for £38.00 and which i was promised. Another week or two and i receive a letter in the post informing me of another price increase of up to around £50.00 per month to keep my package. Again i complained and was told i could have my package frozen at £45.00 if i renewed my contract (naughty naughty). After a long discussion with an adviser i was told that i was also actually paying for sport channels which i never asked for. I took his advice and had the package changed yet again  and was fairly happy with the service at £45.00 per month. Then my speed and connection problems came for another visit and i spent hours on the phone trying to sort it with another technical adviser. It was found to be a faulty router which i was promised was the best thing since sliced bread when they mis-sold me the original package. A new router was sent and we all had fun re-signing passwords once again. Then my next bill came in!!!! £61.19. I was by this time furious and sent some choice word emails and once again messed around on the phone and online. THREE times i was dis connected from a live chat and nobody wanted to help. After blowing my fuse and making threats of desertion i was told sorry Mr Stephens but they have made a mistake with your call plan and have charged you for local and international calls. They had also messed up in both June and July and simply added the extra cost to your new bill  but here`s £7.00 back as a refund..""yeh right"".. Absolutely disgusting. I have now cancelled my contract and moved on because of their persistent errors and incompetence. Now they call me and tell me i have to pay a fee of over £400 for leaving a mis-sold contract to early. ""Bring it on BT"". I am so looking forward to our day in court when your incompetence and persistent lies are made public.~~~",Kent~~~,2018-08-11~~~,1,1,3,2
The most appalling customer service I have ever received. Few months ago I received an email offering me 2gb extra on my sim at no extra cost  oif I sign up for 18 months contract. My mistake  I fell into this trap and signed up to this deal. I received an email from BT explaining that you will now receive extra 2GB but my bill would increase by £10 more. I spoke to several customer service people and complaint was open long time ago with no resolution. Early last month one of their agents advised me that I have two separate accounts with Bt one for mobile and one for land line and broadband if I merge these accounts my mobile data allowance will double up from 8 to 16 GB at no extra cost and he will also resolve billing issue for me. Again my mistake it’s been weeks neither my data has doubled up nor my billing has been resolved.  My complaint was escalated to level 2 and I was told that they will sort it within 5 days. Yesterday on completion of 5 day deadline I spoke with BT and I have now been told that department is very busy and they don’t know how long this will take to settle. Furthermore since merging two accounts extra services which are offered by the BT eg parental control  web protection have been locked and I am unable to make any changes to their settings.  I have reported this issue to broadband tech support team separately on multiple occasions but in spite of their promises no one has been able to resolve this issue either. It appears that departments are not talking to each other and they have a field team responsible to sort out some of the issues but other departments have no phone access to field team. I feel so frustrated and angry with such poor customer experience and don’t know where to go next. All customer service advisors speak in a very polite manner and apologise for the inconvenience multiple times but no actions are taken to resolve the complaint. No one is willing to take ownership and every time you ring your call ends up in a different office and every time I have  to start telling them my issue from start. It is so depressing.~~~,United Kingdom ~~~,2018-08-11~~~,1,1,2,1
Absolute rubbish.no broadband for over 9 days so far still not back on. Phoned numerous times to be told it'll be on within 48hours and it still hasn't. Been hung up on twice.

Poor all round service  BT need to get rid of the off shore Indian contingent they are at best incompetent. Also beware of which support number you use to call them they have the cheek to actually charge you for them to rectify their issues. Also the Broadband speed is poor most of the time however the service remains reliable. I dread having to call their support service which is simply awry  disorganised and quite simply rubbish.~~~,Lichfield~~~,2018-08-10~~~,1,1,1,1

Firstly my reason for writing this review is that they mis sold  my family to a worst broadband not telling us we would lose are fibre place. And for several months we've been hetically trying to find a solution and BT and EE have not co operated or taken action.Secondly they surprised us with nearly doubling the amount of money we had to pay for our monthly contract. And our broadband has become more slow. We are deeply disappointed with BT after being a customer with them for more than 8yrs. And we don't recommend using BT. If it was possible i would of loved to give it zero stars.~~~,england~~~,2018-08-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
