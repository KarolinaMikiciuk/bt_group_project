"BT fitted a new line for free which seemed excellent. Speeds were 28MB with a low ping. Fast forward 3 months  my sync is suddenly locked to exactly 20000Kb  ping is terrible (35 when previously 8 to UK servers). I try over and over to speak to BT  being told someone will contact me and that they are chasing the fault. After weeks of chasing them they finally get back to me and say there's no fault and everything is fine. Apparently is sudden 8Mb drop on my connection (30% of my total speed!) is normal and is possibly down to  and I quote ""more people connecting now"". My old connection had a slightly better ping and would sync at 25Mb. I've moved to BT and EVERYTHING IS WORSE. I couldn't recommend against them enough.~~~","Worcester, UK~~~",2014-12-13~~~,1,1,1,2
Good but now flawed. I like BT and have had MUCH better speeds than when I was with Sky. However  recently when I've needed help I have been treated VERY badly by customer services. I don't like being spoken to as though I was an idiot. When my contract runs out I will be looking to change providers.~~~,Tameside~~~,2014-12-12~~~,3,1,4,3
With a speed of 0.48mbps how can this be viewed as broadband.   I was achieving similar speed using dial up many years ago but am now charged significantly more.   The use of the term 'up to speed' is a con.   The only comment I can make on reliability is that the lights on the hub flash regularly and I lose my connection  such as it is  so at least BT should be able to claim that that at least is reliable.~~~,Carlisle~~~,2014-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Failed promises from day one. I was told my servcies was going to start 3rd of december then they kept pushing it back uptill 15th of December. As a new customer its impossible to speak to any one. so cancelled afer reading preious reviews.~~~,west yorkshire~~~,2014-12-10~~~,1,1,1,1

BT are shocking. No two ways about it. I have used them in multiple contexts and now I have myself a dilemma. I've moved house temporarily and work from home routinely. The area I am in is not a Virgin Media one  who frankly were incredibly good relative to the rest of the market all in. I am stuck with basically two suppliers that I'll consider  PlusNet and BT.  BT  when it works  works. That's all I have to say on that. Out of the Fibre providers who are not Virgin Media the service is often faultless  but not often enough. The thing that is stopping me signing up personally again is that I know that if something goes wrong  there will be absolutely no way of fixing it.  I don't know what 'dimension' BT work in  but their customer services couldn't be more useless. Additionally  logging a ticket just means the ticket disappears altogether. You will never get a resolution to any issue that you find and you'll not be able to cancel. So imaging signing up to an 18 month contract and 20 days in  find it stopped working as the traffic has reshaped so that you are now not getting the 76Mbps but nearer  say  3Mbps. You're basically done for.  You can't cool off (the cool off period for BT seems to be different to everyone else  since they can't seemingly install inside that 14 day time period) and with shaping  it takes time to get to your final speed. Potentially more than 14 days. So what you pay for  you won't get and unlike other providers out there  there will be no resolution for it  other than to go to the communications Ombudsman or make a complaint to Ofcom.  Tickets getting lost has happened to me in commercial environments. So I'd be loathed to take a hit personally on this. I was previously with Virgin Media. Relative to the rest of the market  Virgin media are head and shoulders above the rest. I can't describe how much I miss that service now. Bear in mind the rest of the providers on the market run on BT's network  even if they've been sold some percentage of racks in an exchange  it's still BT's infrastructure. This is one of the reasons that they are also poor. In a way some of it is entirely out of their control. The question then becomes how well other providers can make their value adds work.~~~,Manchester~~~,2014-12-10~~~,1,1,3,2
BT were a good company 10 years ago. Now they cut you off at random as a result of not carrying out work they promise has been done. If you try to speak to someone (presumably to save money at no interest to their customers) you wait on automatic answerphones for 20 minutes  to get disgruntled staff who keep you waiting 20 minutes 'sorting the problem out'  just co cut you off do you have to start again. etc. etc. You can never get continuity with one contact  and none of them seem to have any clue what their colleagues have said or done. Without doubt the worst communications 'organisation' I have come across. They can't even communicate with themselves. To big  & absolutely disinterested in their customers. Total lack of management organisation. Their adverts of how good they are and how they care about customers are perhaps the greatest work of fiction ever created.~~~,great wishford~~~,2014-12-10~~~,1,1,3,1

Where to start. I joined BT from Sky around 2 months ago due to my Mum having Infinity and her speeds being great. First when the broadband is working it's good not great but good. My room and the kids room get very poor strength which wasn't a problem when I was with Sky. Now the big problem the reliability of the connection. Despite having their latest Hub the 5 my broadband drops around 10-15 times a day which when your sons are gaming and your tv service is dependant on the internet is a huge problem. So far apart from being spoken to like a simpleton schoolboy they've done nothing to address the issue. So after reading all these other terrible reviews I've decided to try Virgin. They can simply chase me for what they'll say I owe. I'm not paying for a service that is of a far below par quality.So after writing this I'll contact Virgin and see if they can offer a more reliable service. AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!~~~,Glasgow~~~,2014-12-09~~~,1,1,3,1
I was charged £130 for a new line even though I had an active line .their customer service is a waste of time  they do not listen they talk like Robots. I am waiting for the end of my contract then I wiil leave BT and never consider them ever again.I will make sure none of my family or friends use them.~~~,Cambridge~~~,2014-12-09~~~,1,1,3,3
Once connection problems sorted out by engineers  great broadband and service.~~~,Lowestoft~~~,2014-12-09~~~,5,5,5,5
The overall speed is poor at best (Around 6mbps if you trust the results of the test). However my biggest gripe is with their reliability of both the broadband service and their router hardware. The homehub 3 is a shocker. It basically loses connected devices  causes Resolving Host issues (constantly) and needs restarting more frquently than a Delorean. Then you try customer service and they want to sell you a new one...to replace the naff one they provided? Added to which  they want to send an engineer over who is basically there to find any reason he can to say it's not their fault and charge £80 for the pleasure of doing you over. Really bad. Really really bad.~~~,"Midlands, UK~~~",2014-12-09~~~,2,1,2,1
I have been with BT for over 3 years. Went with them because they claim to have the most reliable internet connection. This is not the case. They have one of  if not the worst internet reliabity I have ever experienced. What annoys me more is the speed and the price. There lack of customer service to long standing existing customers is disgusting. I have rang them on numerous times to discuss this but they just fob you off and don't even seemed bothered. And now they have stooped to new low. We have decided to give another provider ago and since our new provider contacted BT to arrange swapping the line etc the internet as become even more slow. I am without doubt sure they have slowed my internet further has fingers up to me leaving them. How can company the size of BT not be concerned with losing customers who are spending over £500 a year? If only I could run my business like that. Anyway if I was you I would try another provider.~~~,Leicester~~~,2014-12-08~~~,2,2,1,1
I don't leave reviews as a rule but have had enough of this terrible service My broadband drops at least once a day(today it 's dropped 8 times)Customer service always want to send out an engineer when they have already done it (don't they know people can't keep having time off work)and found the problem is not in the house.BT did offer to compensate me for 2 days without internet .They offered a grand sum of 13p!!!All I can say is I'm going back to PlusNet ASAP~~~,Crewe~~~,2014-12-06~~~,3,2,3,2
for three years this scum bag of a company has taken our money and failed to provide a service! Complained many times always told it was our fault eventually got to an agent who realised it wasn't our fault (a big deal with bt) and arranged a call back! Well that never happened. I'll give them until tomorrow if they don't I'll be calling asking to speak to a manager and if they can't help I'll be going to ofcom. For three years we've had broadband that is slow  unreliable and always drops out (our previous supplier never had these issues!) bt are a disgrace avoid at all costs~~~,Exmouth~~~,2014-12-06~~~,1,1,1,1
"I've been with BT broadband paying for their best  braodband option available Infinity 2. It's rubbish. The smartly advertised speed called UP TO ... explains it all. It's almost never there. Customer service is also a joke. And process of leaving BT too.  It is also a pain in the ""A"". They will tray to charge you £30 just for leaving them even if you have served your full contract term. They will charge you for everything even for payment processing pretty much like Ryanair does.  On the top of that I think that BT should be reported to the Watch Dog and Office of Fair Trading for dishonest advertising  They are advertising that their Infinity 2 broadband is a Fibre Optic Broadband which is not truth as its only HALF Fibre Optic Broadband!!! The only fibre optic cable there is the one that runs from local BT exchange box into your house but all cables running to that local BT exchange box are old copper cables. The only UK 100% Fibre Optic Braodband is from Virgin. BT? No thank you !~~~",Mitcham~~~,2014-12-05~~~,1,1,2,2
After agreeing that a BT engineer would install a new line and telephone box into my house as part of me joining BT. The BT engineer never turned up and I was emailed to say that my service was switched on via an old BT line I had years earlier used for business in my house. I contacted BT so they could correct their mistake. They denied all knowledge of the agreement  stated T&C about general installation and said that to move a box would cost me from £130 -£200 (the figure varied depending on which department I spoke with). Not one department could arrange for an engineer to correct their mistake. An engineer explained that as they were a different part of BT they couldn't correct faults of other parts of BT. In the end I was advised to try again tomorrow when maybe there might be someone who could take responsibility. Thankfully I'm still within my 14 day period. My advice don't trust them.~~~,hinckley~~~,2014-12-04~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I've used more swear words since using BT moving house service  than ever before.Just when you think they can't get any worse they suprise you.They are very good at charging you for services you didn't have  or didn't want  then charge you again for cancelling them.~~~,brentwood~~~,2014-12-02~~~,1,1,1,1

Having been with another company for over 25 years I transferred to BT Broadband.  Before doing so I asked and was told that I could ask  if it ever became necessary  to speak to someone whose first language was English - no need to say anymore about that (And I have no prejudices) it's just that I'm not a qualified English teacher!  So after three different contracts I eventually got my equipment.  BT admin is a total disaster.  Things have been going along reasonably smoothly  apart from when they tried to blackmail me into signing up again for 12 months in order to get BT sport.  But FINALLY - for some unknown reason I recently received my latest email bill from BT.  When I tried to have a look at this - instead of the usual pages coming up I was informed that I would have to register with a new BT ID.  Now my troubles really started.  I spent 1 hour and 20 minutes trying to explain to a person whose first language was not English that I was quite content with the system that I had been using for the past 25 years i.e. Outlook Express.  I asked to speak to the line manager but he was too busy so it was arranged that a person from the next level up would phone me to resolve my problem.  This WAS done and the level 2 agent spent over 20 minutes with the system so that I would continue getting my email via Microsoft Outlook Express.  Needless to say this hasn't happened.  Now I can only get my email through the BT server  using a BT email system and already I am getting spam that I've avoided for over 20 years and  into the bargain  I'm also now getting BT ads for other companies that presumably pay BT for the privilege.

I live in Weston SubEdge Chipping Campden  a relatively affluent Cotswold Village where the clock has been retarded to Victorian times by BT. The phone and broadband services  patchy at the best of times  have  since last Monday disappeared; with no update as to when they will be fixed. Local businesses  medical-service dependent pensioners and GCSE students can't access vital services. There has been no Black Friday or Cyber Monday in Weston SubEdge. Several hundred homes are affected. I hear on the jungle drums that BT is unable to fix the problem until 20th December  almost a month without service.  Today they put BT line rental bills up. Classic monopoly with rubbish customer service. How can we affect their NPS? Affecting their bonuses may be the only way to get them to listen.~~~,Weston SubEdge~~~,2014-12-01~~~,2,1,2,2
"I have BT's best for around here  80 mbps.  I'm lucky to be very near the cabinet and I actually get close to that speed  74 to be picky.  I did however have some problems in the months following it's installation  with speed. It would drop by 50% or more every 3-4 days and required a reset of the router to fix it.I noticed that it never dropped below that speed. I got fed up and suspected that BT were taking the Michael; charging me for 80 and supplying 35. Let's face it most people wouldn't notice! I complained about this and got a phone call telling me the line was fine and the problem was ""static electricity build up on the router"" and that I would have to continue to do a reset when speed dropped. What sort of modern equipment would be susceptible to that? I guess he was reading from a crib sheet. HOWEVER since my complaint a strange thing has happened.  Not once since  and it's more than 6 weeks now  has the speed dropped. Not once! Static build up my derriere!~~~",West Sussex~~~,2014-11-29~~~,4,4,5,5
I have been on BT Broadband since 2001. They are now the worst I have had since broadband started. Today email is down when email is up you have 15 minutes before it times out and you have to re log on. I asked the help desk somewhere in England and they said that's it that's how it is going to be. At my job we are going to drop BT that includes phone lines. I am sure they left Yahoo to save money big mistake. I would have paid more to stay in it~~~,London~~~,2014-11-28~~~,1,2,3,1
I signed up to BT and I can honestly say I found them a very reputable company. There customer service was excellent & very open to reason when it came to a complaint. I only left because I found a cheaper package which sadly BT couldn't match at the time. Sadly not long after I left BT they rang & offered me a cheaper deal than what I was originally paying. But I had already paid my up front line rental with my new provider.  I'm hoping the ISP I'm with now will live up to its expectations. If not I would gladly return to BT even though it ment I was paying a little more. I've read some of the bad reviews BT have received. But I can only go on my experience with them & I would personally   recommend them.~~~,Rotherham~~~,2014-11-28~~~,5,5,4,5
Absolutely pathetic. The broadband here was never going to be quick but they way the village is treated is unbelievable! BT Infinity has been put through the village so that the town next to us could use it  but they didn't let us! Now all of a sudden my internet has dropped down to 130kbs. That's disgusting  and BT will do sweet F A about it. Disgusting company who genuinely don't care as long as they are making a profit.~~~,Griston~~~,2014-11-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling!.. I live in a small cottage and cannot get a signal. Have to reboot on average 6 times per day. Only been with them since September  biggest mistake. Cannot leave and change providers as they want to charge me £295 termination fee  even though they are NOT providing the service I am paying for!Shocking!~~~,Fife~~~,2014-11-25~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been using BT Infinity for a year and a half. When I had to move houses i called BT to cancel my contract  the person i talked to told me that there would be a £37 cancellation charge on top of my regular monthly bill. After that it all went wrong and BT kept emailing of outstanding bills that kept changing and no one was able to give me an explanation. I am overall very disappointed at the end of the day i had to pay what they asked in order for my account to close as it affected my credit score. I was harassed to pay a bill that made no sense because i had no choice. Would definitely NOT recommend  there are other companies out there that might have problems too but at least half as expensive on the monthly bills.~~~,London~~~,2014-11-25~~~,1,2,3,3
Have had BT Infinity 1 fibre optic broadband for a while now and never had any problems with it  speeds I am getting are comparable with Virgin and wi-fi has been more reliable. Customer service has been good too when I've had need to raise a query.~~~,Co. Durham~~~,2014-11-25~~~,5,4,5,5
I recently took out bt infinity and although the speed test connections say I'm getting 35mpd all my devices struggle to open any web pages and streaming is almost impossible. I contacted bt about this and they was next to no use telling me that I'm getting the download speed they say. I'm very disappointed with infinity and will be going back to my standard connection as soon as I can as I found the connection far quicker. I would defiantly not recommend bt infinity to anyone~~~,Northampton~~~,2014-11-24~~~,1,1,1,2
The worst company I've had to deal with: terrible customer service  terrible broadband speed  terrible reliability & terrible hardware (hub 3 router). How this monopoly is allowed to get away with this is amazing. Not only that but they lie. Almost once a year the phone line & broadband goes down usually for at least a week. Its always for the same reason: crumbling wiring & switchgear in the road outside. Their own engineers have told me that the repeated problems are because BT won't spend the money to upgrade the 1970's aluminium cabling etc (not even copper). A few weeks ago it was down for 2 weeks. I received almost no information or updates. When I repeatedly complained that there was no evidence in the area of any work being done to repair it I was told that the fault was a major problem at the exchange & was affecting a large area & was taking longer to sort out. Sure enough a van appeared in the road outside our house on the 14th day & within 3 hours it was fixed. When I asked about the 'major problem at the exchange' the engineer said he nothing about that & he was just sent to fix a problem in the road outside.~~~,East Sussex~~~,2014-11-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband speed is very slow. Wanted to upgrade to Infinity and ordered and then BT has cancelled my order saying that it is not available in my area. Then  BT called me again and said Infinity is available and I ordered again. Guess what they cancelled again. When I check on their website with my phone number and postcode it says Infinity is available. As I live in a new development area I had to use this terrible service for ages.~~~,Cambridge~~~,2014-11-22~~~,1,1,1,1
After recently moving house I’ve ended up with BT Broadband. They sent me a Home Hub which is a dreadful bit of rubbish  have recently reverted back to my old NetGear router. One of the issues I had with the BT hub is that BT seem to mysteriously do stuff to it remotely  and there is a distinct lack of user configuration tools  unlike the NetGear which the user has complete control of.  Have had major issues with their Parental Controls stuff. I have not enabled this  but every so often a message pops up advising me to switch it on  with no way of dismissing the message and getting back to the site I was accessing. I eventually phoned their help desk in India and was treated like an idiot. I said I wanted nothing to do with ‘Parental Controls’ as there are no children in the house but was told it’s a government order that all users will be hassled to switch the stuff on in 2014. BT service levels are practically non-existent with the Indian call centres a total joke. I keep getting letters from them advising me to move to Infinity broadband for more speed. But I’m connected to the Rose Street exchange which is not fibre enabled  and BT have no plans to do so as they say it’s not economical for that exchange. So in conclusion would avoid BT if that is possible. If this Parental Control issues is not sorted soon I’m going to ditch BT broadband. But either way I’m stuck with them as they own the copper lines from the exchange. Sooner or later the government is going to have to bite the bullet and fund a project to re-wire the UK and provide fibre to every house.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2014-11-22~~~,1,1,3,2
Absolutely appalling customer service.  Had ongoing Broadband problem for months. Was told a manager would call me back on 3 different occasions. Waited in specially only to receive no phone call as promised. This is after spending a ridiculous number of hours on the phone to BT and getting absolutely nowhere. Fed up of their ridiculous repetitive scripts  complete lack of knowledge and utter lack of decent customer service. Finally taking my business elsewhere!~~~,London~~~,2014-11-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Bt hate customers. Spent 3 weeks trying to get an engineer out. When I managed to book one he did not turn up. Waited another week and had a visit and was told it was fixed. In this time internet dropping out for days at a time or so slow unusable. Still not fixed. Rang call centre again who refused to request another engineer to visit as we were 'long line' i.e. rural. Had broadband for many years at this address so why can't they sort it now. They dont listen to what you say  just keep repeating the same thing. Also they gave us the option of cancelling the service( without penalty! How generous) or carry on paying for the few minutes we manage to connect. As they are the only providers in the area we have no option but to continue paying a premium price for an appalling service. Also our neighbours (who presumably have the same length of line are able to get reasonable broadband)~~~,hereford~~~,2014-11-22~~~,1,1,1,1
As of today if I do not get any satisfaction from BT I will throw they equipment out of my house. Below is some of the dealings I had with BT staff from England  Scotland  Ireland and India and still nothing sorted I would like to invite you to a problem I am having British Telecom. On the 11 July I place an order for BT to install telephone line  broadband and TV package (included with the package I would receive £60 of Sainsburys Vouchers) as I had completed my order on line. I then contacted one BT staff on telephone number 0800800150 to confirm my order and told the young man that I wanted to bring my telephone number from virgin media  with me to which he agree I could do that he also said that I did not need to do anything as BT would contact Virgin media to close my account and at the same time get the telephone number over from them  he also confirm that there was a BT line at my property and a date was agreed for installation on the 24 July 2014.    On the 24th July 2014 two work men arrived and spent sometime trying to find a line into the building eventually their left and said someone would contact  but no one contacted me so I call them a couple of days later ended up speaking to number of people in India who did not have a clue what was going so having made several more calls later I eventually spoke to someone by the name of Lauren Atkinson in Sunderland who was very apologetic and eventually she told me that she would arrange an engineer to come out to me on 31 July 2014 she also promise that she would then call me back in the afternoon of 31 July 2014 to check everything was going alright I also made her aware that I would like to make a formal complaint about the service I was receiving and the cost of many calls I was having to keep to contacting BT on my mobile phone she also agree that I had made several very long calls to each time to India and I would be given back that money ( I never got that call she promised)  so I rang again and asked for her and excuses were made that she would call me which did not happen.  An engineer suddenly turn up on the  30 July 20014 and found the line to the building then left after saying someone will come to run the line into my property. Another engineer arrived the following week and connect the line in my property and after lots of calls to India once again I finally got my Internet connected (but it did work for several days) and the phone connected on the 10 August 2014  but no email address and I still do not have an email address at the time of writing this email to you. On 13 August 2014 I spoke to Kiera from Scotland who said she was sorry  but no one had contact Virginmedia about closing the  account or transfer my telephone number and I would have to do this myself so the following day  I contacted Virginmedia who confirm no one has contacted them form BT and that I would have to give 30 days notice (Kiera did say I could send the bill from Virginmedia to BT for them to pay it) On Saturday  23 August 2014 I rang BT and spoke to Alex I explain that I wanted to cancel the order due to it taking so long to complete   but he was very rude and aggressive and said if I cancel I would be made to pay for the full 18 months contract.  Over the period of time trying to get BT to install all these items in my property I have made hundreds of calls to various people and not one of them have follow through or sorted out the installation or even calling me back when their said there would and you ask for them their never available to speak with me there and always some body new to speak  and the same old apology I'm sorry I'm sorry but nothing ever got done I even try telling them their were doing a great job just to get proper service. I also was told that I cannot receive my £60 Sainsbury's voucher or any of my sports apps because I do not have a email address On the 27 August 2014 I rang BT again and spoke to a female who told me her name was Colin - customer service from Aberdeen she admitted after reading some of my notes that I have been treated pretty badly  but could not tell when I would get my email address she also said I could not cancel on my bases that I believe BT has breach its own contract with me by not completing its installation agreement on the date 24 July 2014 or even now with me it also seems to me that much of BT staff are reading from scripts as every one them will say sorry over 20 times during the conversations  but it means nothing if you are not getting the service you are paying for BT has even have the cheek to start taking payment from account.  Here are a list of some of the other BT staff I have spoken too since 11 July 2014 all at my own expenses Katie ( who mess up the very frist sign up) Shrey  Lav(the person who mess up email address)  Jagriti  Roopa  Cas  Mikhail  Ankur  Zoe  Saawan  Sakshi  Minekshi  Tenzin  Sairon (told me he wasTenzin manager)  David  Jim  Katie  Daniel  Arijit  Srinivas all said there will call me back and none have.

I have had problems with dropping connection  slow speed over the last six months. Customer service is not great. I'm fed up explaining the same problem to different people who then give me conflicting diagnosis and advice. I would encourage everyone who has similar experience to make a formal complaint  get the reference number and fill in compensation form  not so much for the compensation but to force BT to accept responsibility. Im paying for a service that they are not providing.~~~,Glasgow ~~~,2014-11-21~~~,2,2,2,2
TERRIBLE TERRIBLE AND TERRIBLE STAY VERY VERY CLEAR.  Internet speed slow  email account practically unusable for large periods of time - does absolutely nothing it says on the tin 90% of the time - worst service ever  connection speed anywhere between 0-1Mb most of the time  (is that not the same as the old dial speeds???????????) USE ANYONE BUT THIS SORRY EXCUSE FOR A COMPANY YOU WILL SPEND HOURS ON THE PHONE TRYING TO GET SOMEONE TO MAKE YOUR INTERNET AND/OR BT EMAIL ACCOUNTS TO WORK FROM INDIA AND NEVER GET MORE THAN A FEW OPTION CHANGES AND THEN THEY WILL 'REVIEW IT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME' AND YOU WILL START ALL OVER AGAIN WITHOUT EVER GETTING THE SERVICE YOU PAY FOR~~~,Nottingham~~~,2014-11-20~~~,1,1,1,1

Switched from sky who were reliable but too expensive. 5 weeks past connection date with BT and still no broadband.
