I do not actually have BT wifi myself but I am a private live I carer and any client I have gone to that has had BT wifi there is always issues with the speed and reliability of their wifi. I think I have had more than 10 clients with BT and every single one has been such a hassle that I just use my phone data. Stay clear of BT as they are useless!~~~,Kent~~~,2020-01-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Sold superfast upgrade.  Once signed up BT had failed to check if they could provide service.  Now waiting for upgrade of line and points.  No date given for completion. Sharp selling and poor service.  Do not hold your breath.~~~,Norfolk ~~~,2020-01-22~~~,2,1,1,1
Just a quickish compliment. Recently swapped back to BT from EE. EE was very good but in researching to get my bill down  I found that EE were about to cease their replay TV box which I used a lot. The EE call package was better and their TV box  I found better than Youview. Nonetheless I got a slightly better monthly price with which the new installation included fibre to the door and hub plus the 'complete wi-fi' disc package. The whole kit send  hook up and installation (about £39) was all trouble free and on time. I got near max (38MB/sec) speeds almost immediately. The first install only had one disc but I had a few weak spots and phoned up to get the other two they allow (they sent one at a time but that was fine  it gave me a chance to trial two only). I still had a bit of an issue in two spots in the house with two discs (three floors and a lot of metal) but now with three discs I have 36-38 everywhere including in a shed that's about 12 feet from the house (wi-fi signal has to punch through walls and windows plus wood of shed). All in all I have to say I'm very impressed.~~~,Kent~~~,2020-01-20~~~,5,5,5,5
We carried out a community funded project on our estate for over 400 residents to receive FTTP capabilities. We worked alongside BT  being made multiple false promises by their marketing team. As soon as the connections went live  they ceased all communication with us  and when customers had to complain about service  they were not interested at all. Worst display of customer service and lies from a large company I have seen for a long time. Zen is definitely now our preferred supplier.~~~,Newcastle upon Tyne~~~,2020-01-19~~~,1,1,5,5
I have had BT broadband for the past 5 years at my current address and am paying £52 a month for super fast broadband 1 which is far too much. Went on the BT website and found that new customers can get the same service for £29.99 and then £37.99 after 24 months. I phoned them up to 're-negotiate' a new contract and was told that  was what was agreed when I took it out so they can't give me a better deal. I told them I will leave if that's the case so she 'spoke to her manager' and said they could give it me it for £45.99 a month - still £8 a month more than a new customer once out of contract.I've signed up for this price as I've never had a problem with the speed/reliabilty etc and looking at reviews for other providers they all seem worse than BT (unable to get Virgin in my area.)It is disgraceful that a loyal customer should have to pay more than a new customer though.~~~,Cartmel~~~,2020-01-16~~~,3,2,4,4
Ordered on the 2nd December  engineer turned up 16th December then never heard anything back until I chased new year. They missed 4 appointments in a row  explained situation and why was important to be done by a certain date.. still not kept to date so was forced to cancel order. If that was the start of a new customer I was fearful what would happen if I had an actual issue. not pleased~~~,Essex~~~,2020-01-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Being fobbed off completely how rubish is this company My partner have got them for broadband broad band was fine for a few months then they started cutting us off before the bill was due to be paid then after we paid it on the day it was due the broadband started to go funny my partner rang them up and they said that it's because it's under the stair case and because my partner has a ps4 on the wifi and some phones on the wifi which is exactly the same as when we started off so the sent a wifi booster so we can hard wire the ps4 which by the way seems a bit weird in how its set up we set it up and ps4 doesn't work hard wired plus the box then turns amber and doesn't budge and then my partner rings up about 7 times and the whole time they keep hanging up on him then we manage to get someone to stay on the line and he's now saying that we have to put everything back to where it originally was as you can't hard wire the ps4 the way we have been tolddoes anyone in that company know exactly what they are doing at all because to us all it doesn't seem like it which means there shouldn't be a bt company anymore~~~,Green Hammerton ~~~,2020-01-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Had some issues with customer service in the past but picking up the telephone to call someone will get you much better service than live chat. Reliable service and speed. My price went up after 18 months but a quick phone call telling BT I'd found a better offer elsewhere and they brought my price down by more than half price a month. Highly recommend.~~~,Southport~~~,2020-01-08~~~,5,4,5,5
Worse decision I've ever made! I thought I was changing for a better supplier but I was complete wrong. Don't be silly as I was and join BT. They're just money takers and you will regret your decision. I have now two internet suppliers as BT never works! Advice? Go Virgin! Best you can find.~~~,Oxford~~~,2020-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
SOLD US FIBRE THAT DIDNT EVEN EXIST CLAIMED WE HAD ACCESS TO IT IN OUR AREA....Without doubt the worst customer service ive ever experienced.Calls and emails completely ignored.My company took case to communications ombudsman and had all 6 issues upheld.You would never in a million years believe a company of this magnitude could get away with level of poor customer service.the sort of experience youd expect if you bought broadband of Del boy and Rodney.AVOID AVOID AVOID~~~,boyle~~~,2020-01-03~~~,1,1,1,1
There is direct fibre optic to premises where I live - BT of course (monopoly).The max speed offered at my address is 350 Mbs / 50 Mbs. I ordered Super Fibre 2 which is 74 Mbs / 20 Mbs. I achieve 10 Mbs upload and BT says there is nothing they could do about it. This is how they screw customers at address where they have monopoly. I would never join them if I had a chance to choose other provider. HOW CAN THEY OFFER 50 Mbs upload at the address and they can't provide anything above 10 Mbs?? I will never choose them again!~~~,Glasgow~~~,2019-12-28~~~,2,3,2,4
"The most incompetent company I've ever had the displeasure of buying from. After attempting to set up a fibre broadband package at my new home  I was informed on my activation date that the original order wasn't even actually confirmed due to human error. I then attempted to set up my broadband package again. Two weeks later  on my new activation date  I was told that the order had been cancelled moments after I placed it despite the fact that I had not been informed and had made two subsequent calls to check on the order where I was told it was processing. It turns out they had tried to take over my neighbour's line instead of the deactivated line because  for some reason  when confronted by two active lines and one deactivated line  they assume one of the active lines is the one I'm attempting to set up broadband on. I'm currently sitting on my phone being told by a BT rep that they won't be able to honour my original deal now for reasons that can only be summed up as ""we don't want to do it anymore""  even though the only reason I don't have broadband at the original price is because of their own incompetence. I will never buy a BT product again and any BT rep I see standing on a sidewalk during a rainy day is getting splashed.~~~",Ely~~~,2019-12-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling lack of clarity when getting broadband installed. I ended up taking days off work to wait at home for engineers that never turned up.  Please I urge anyone reading this to never get BT internet~~~,Manchester~~~,2019-12-19~~~,2,1,3,5
They allowed a takeover to take place without informing me about it and tried to charge me a cancellation fee.  I was then promised priority re-connection which was a blatant lie  I was promised to be reconnected by a specific date which was also a lie.  A code of ethics is missing in BT.  Trying to charge me for their mistake (proof: text message informing me of the takeover came a day late and the letter was dated a day after my internet was disconnected)  lying blatantly to my face  what kind of business practice is that?  During the whole process  it took 3 different reps to actually get an apology for what happened  they made absolutely no effort to compensate me in any way for my inconvenience. In fact  Instead things kept getting delayed and I had to argue to get a refund done for the part of the month I paid and didn't use.  In conclusion  if you want reliable service  professional and courteous customer service and ethical approach to situations  believe me when I say  BT is none of those.  Do yourself a favour and go with literally anyone else.  You will save yourself a headache.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2019-12-18~~~,1,1,1,1
God awful people and a god awful service. They add hidden charges in to your bill but will never ever tell you what the charges are. When you ask one of the idiots at the help centre they can never  or will not tell you what they relate to. Ask for a full breakdown they will send exactly the same bill you are questioning. Be warned  you will never know what you are paying for. Don’t use this company.~~~,Liverpool~~~,2019-12-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Very disappointed with BT 's customer service and broadband speed.~~~,Cupar~~~,2019-12-11~~~,1,1,1,~~~
The broadband is okay but it does drop out. What really bugs me is their dishonest practices. I rang to say my broadband was not giving acceptable speeds  and they said I should have been sent a new hub the last time I upgraded. They agreed to send it out free of charge. What I didn’t realise was that they renewed my contract at the same time - signing me up to another 18 months. They added Sky Sports  some HD thing which were free for three months and then started charging me. None of this was discussed on the phone. Due to some family difficulties  I didn’t check for a few months. By which time my bill  had gone up from £27 to £65 a month. I called them and after TWO hours on the phone I got the sports and HD stopped and refunded. They said they could not listen to calls that were longer than six months ago. That they refunded me as a gesture of “goodwill.” But I am still tied into a contract for another year. I will then leave as I find this kind of sales tactic unacceptable. I got the impression they are well aware of their dodgy dealings and the line “we can’t listen to calls made more than six months ago” is a well-used get out clause from admitting their dishonest sales practices. Shame on you BT. No wonder they don’t have Facebook reviews activated!~~~,Droitwich ~~~,2019-12-09~~~,2,1,3,3
"I've been at this property for approx 4 years. for 3 years and 6 months  the connection I couldn't complain about. approx 12Mbps  but it worked. probably dropped connection about once per week. either wifi dropped  or hubs connection to the net dropped. no real problems. for the past 6 months (second half of 2019)  the speed has gone up to 20Mbps (which is nice) but my connection has been dropping  probably up to 5 times per day  either wifi  or hub to net. it is starting  to get slightly irritating. websites will stop responding for no reason  5 second delay  then ""no internet"" message. wait 20 or 30 seconds and it usually comes back. I haven't contacted customer service about it yet.~~~",Gloucestershire~~~,2019-12-09~~~,3,~~~,3,2

Mistakes after mistakesTransferred from Sky to BT on 18th November retaining my old number only to find out on 21st November they gave me a new number. Customer service has been terrible trying to resolve this and I won’t have my proper phone number back until 5th December (large pinch of salt taken) so I would be very wary of any service commitments they make. They also tried to charge me £25 for the privilege of sorting out their cockup. Disastrous so I would strongly advise against them~~~,Scotland ~~~,2019-11-26~~~,1,1,5,4

"If you want to get internet from BT make sure you place your order at least 6 months in advance. Last time i believed 3 and a half months just happened by mistake  but 6 years later it's the same.

Well  i will sure have now  thank you~~~",Kingswood~~~,2019-11-25~~~,1,4,1,1
Worst company i have ever dealt with. All they are interested in is signing you into a contract then providing you with crap service. My broadband speed was 2MB! When i complained they said the small print states a minimum of 1 MB ! They then offered me an updated router for £70. Dont be fooled by the name. BT is crap. Ive since moved to talk talk. Excellent customer service. Excellent broadband speed and at 1/3 of the price.~~~,Inverness~~~,2019-11-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Honestly I can cope with the crappy broadband speed  what really pisses me off about bt is how often there’s a problem and we just lose internet all together. I’m a student and I have a whole lot of my work online  I rely on the WiFi heavily  so when there’s ‘an error on the line’ so it just doesn’t work and I can’t do anything it’s bloody inconvenient. Inconvenient doesn’t even describe it and I would be a lot more vivid if I could. If I could I would give it 0 in broadband reliability and overall satisfaction. Our WiFi has stopped working altogether multiple times and each time they **** around for a while saying that an engineers coming and then that there was an error and they can’t so it’s delayed and I end up going weeks paying for extra data and piggybacking off the school WiFi and my friends hotspot which costs me money and isn’t good for anyone. On top of this because of where we live I don’t have service anyway so I’m not contactable for a while and can’t do anything. The only reason I wouldn’t give customer service 0 is because I have pity for the poor ******* who work for this company. We pay £30 or something a month for this and honestly I think we should be paid for the torture which is using bt.NEVER USE BT  ITS HELL.

We went with bt as the previous tenant was with bt and we thought it would be a straight forward swap to our name. This was not the case ! We had an order for the phone line and internet to be changed into our name (which apparently you need an engineer to come out 2 weeks later to do) when this was done  we recieved a new number ..we requested from day one to keep the previous number as we were running a business and that was the number our customers where familiar with. We were informed that as soon as the order was completed we can ring up to confirm the number change  So we did. We were then informed that the number would be changed within 24 hours .... 24 hours later the number was still not changed. After ringing back the following day we were then informed that there was another order on the account that had to be completed before the number could be changed. As we had not placed an order they cancelled the order and told us it would be another 24 hours before the order would be cancelled and then to ring back for the number to be changed. So as you can guess we rang back 24 hours later to change the number to then be told someone didnt cancel the order so they would cancel it and it would take another 24 hours ( why it takes 24 hours to press the cancel order button I do not know! ) since receiving our bt order on 5th November we are still waiting to have the number changed back to the original number! After being on the phone many days and many hours I was finally passed to a supervisor who informed me that IF I WAS TO PAY FOR THE BUSINESS ACCOUNT I WOULD RECEIVE A BETTER SERVICE! Which we were told at the beginning it will be easier to stay as a personal customer for now as that is what the previous tenant was and that it would be easy enough to change at a later date! After speaking to this supervisor I was informed that he would cancel the order and he would call me back to re arrange the phone number change between 11:00-13:00  did I recieve a phone call ? NO I DID NOT! I rand up at 13:02 to find out why I hadn't recieved my phone call and the lady on the phone said she had passed the message on for me to get my phone call. The NEXT day I recieved a call which was not from a supervisor and was informed there is nothing they could do as I'm not named on the account even though they have been speaking to me everyday since getting Bt and everyday they recieved permission to talk to me and permission to change the number! All we want to do is have the original number back on the landline which has took 8 DAYS so far and still counting ...~~~,Shocklach~~~,2019-11-13~~~,1,1,1,1
WORST INTERNET EVER! I've tried many different service providers but this is the icing on the cake when it comes to bad internet! There is no internet full stop! The constant connection dips 24/7 is ridiculous! My emails don't even come through for days coz of how bad it is! I can't even game online anymore coz the lag is unreal and embarrassing and everyone keep telling me to switch my service provider coz it's trash! Don't ever go with BT  It's horrendous. I connected it to my phone but it doesn't even connect to my TV. Absolute trash!~~~,Liverpool~~~,2019-11-12~~~,1,1,1,1
After 90 days I finally managed to get broadband ordered. I had to chase BT up for info all through the process instead of them coming to me and the text messages I received bore no relevance to my order. After all that the final guaranteed speed that they can give is an abysmal 3Mb/s~~~,Cumbria~~~,2019-11-11~~~,1,2,1,4
I feel like every one of the reviews for every service provider is automated by the opposing competitors to extend the likelihood of finding different providers.. by was good for me yet the reviews are insanely bad. I got a good deal and had to sign off of it as I literally didn't need it because I bought a phone contract that gets 100gb data a month..~~~,None~~~,2019-11-06~~~,3,4,4,4

BT are the worst. I have bought extenders  upgraded the hub  splut the signal bought more discs  upgraded the service and still have a terrible broadband signal. It pulses and drops out. Only works next to the main hub to watch a film  slow everywhere else in the house. BT only guarantee a signal everywhere in the home  yes I can see the broadband  but it is too slow to use. Avoid at all cost  read their small print  do not guarantee a useable broadband  only guarantee it to the house.~~~,Ystrad Mynach~~~,2019-10-25~~~,1,1,1,1
