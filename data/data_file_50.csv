Well  15 weeks into contract and issues still not resolved and eventually they have the cheek to say they will now let us cancel our contract.  First two weeks no service at all and they said we must have set it up wrong so had to take half day off work to wait for engineer to call.  The engineer confirmed it was their fault as they had set it up wrong at the exchange. This was supposedly corrected.  Still no broad band tv channels after fix was applied.  Was then told it was a line speed issue and ours wasn't fast enough to receive the required channels.  Two days later was told it was a line capacity issue and the fix would be applied in a weeks time. The week passed and no fix was applied.  Will skip the rest but 15 weeks later received a call to say the actual issue was one of their engineers had connected the wrong cables at the exchange and the fix was now in place. Great- I'll watch the channels I want - Sadly not. After re-setting all the kit for some reason all our services had now disappeared so the fix actually made the appalling service even worse.  In total 1.5 days off work for engineers  15 hours on the phone to overseas call centres and still not the service we are paying for. They have the cheek to offer £30 compensation which I promptly told them where to put it.  I want a full refund as I've never received the service I paid for.  Steer well clear of BT. APPALLING CUSTOMER SERVICE and incompetent in every area.~~~,South Oxfordshire~~~,2016-05-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Very unhappy have complained now three times  wish i could take legal action as they are taking fees under false pretences. am not receiving service paid for and then cannot get any sort of customer service.Change speed to router for  few weeks then reverts to rubbish  paying for 76mbs only receiving 29mbs.~~~,near london~~~,2016-05-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband speed is not reliable stops working for 10 minutes when watching a programme . Download speed  takes between 30 minutes to 1 hour instead of  couple of minutes. When is bt going to change the cable to better cable to carry the information that broadband requires .I have infinity 2 I do not recommend it not reliable to expensive.~~~,Paignton devon~~~,2016-05-28~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is terrible. Their customer service is appalling and none of them know what they really talking about. So far I have spoken to bt pretty much every day for the past two weeks and been given 4-5 different excuses as to why my account isn't active. The latest one was because they have cancelled my order due to difficulties???? I am still waiting for a callback from them from a week ago from their complaints department... surprise surprise. Absolutely shocking company! How they have business I don't know???~~~,Thurso~~~,2016-05-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Poor poor poor. PLEASE DO NOT USE BT!! I started a deal 4 years ago £5/month. Since then I've had poor costumer service  poor phone and broadband connections  have had previously free packages added to my bill and direct debit without notification  if you have a connection problem/fault you get an automated service or end up spiraling to someone in India. And my last bill came to £42!!! (We only use the unlimited broadband)Disappointed doesn't even come close. They entice you in on a seemingly great deal. Trap you on 12m/18m multiple running phone and broadband deals. Then proceed to put up the prices and tell you it's all in the terms and conditions!! I'm looking to leave as my contract ends next month but I have to give them 30d notice to leave or 14d notice to switch supplier....even though my contact ends in 2 weeks anyway (....apparently that's in the terms and conditions also  even though I won't be in contact anymore). Summary:DO NOT USE BT!~~~,Cumbria ~~~,2016-05-27~~~,1,1,1,2
WORST COMPANY EVER!!! staff don't know what is doing on  they are rude  they are clueless  plain stupid.  Too expensive for what it's worth  constantly getting things wrong. SO overcharged so glad my contract ended this month.~~~,brighton ~~~,2016-05-27~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Having believed what I was told on the phone I placed an order for Fibre broadband  home phone and three mobile sims. The sims arrived the next day and I set mine up. Number transfer happened the following day and caused 3-4 hours of no service. It was then that I discovered that basic functionality was not supported. As an iPhone/iPad user  tethering devices is a way of life. BT disable it!Visual voicemail either was not set up or is also not supported. So if you have devices you expect to share connection with ... BT refuses to enable this. I discovered the lack of this basic feature whilst out on business calls  I had explained I needed this when ordering  caused me to need to change mobile provider. When I phoned to cancel (5 days after order) I was told I could not have a PAC code to move my number unless I could quote the account number (but email was on iPad and I could not tether to connect). I drove to a wifi hotspot  located account number and called back.  This new contact said  sorry to hear you need a PAC  but issued it without needing an account number. So now I had been lied to twice! It has taken another six calls to try and cancel the order. Every time my new provider tries to take on the service they are blocked by BT saying they have a live order. In summary  do not believe anuthing they say  their customer service  although polite is useless as what they promise does not get done. And as for their automated call answer service ... there is no polite way to describe it. AVOID THEM  use any other company  don't put yourself through the pain!~~~,Kent~~~,2016-05-25~~~,1,1,1,1

I furthered a query I made last week  about new contract. I spoke to a very helpful man  who sorted my problem immediately and told me to then check my e mail  sure enough if was there explain g exactly the terms of my new contract  I couldn't fault the cstomer service ~~~,Lancashire ~~~,2016-05-23~~~,5,5,5,5
DO NOT USE BT! This year was the first time that I have used BT for my broadband services and I completely regret it. Customer service is useless  you have to bug them over and over again to get anything done and it takes on average 10-20 minutes to get through to them. They made mistakes which led to me having issues and even my installation was delayed multiple times. They charge you for anything and everything and even the cancellation fees are more than with any other company. I will never use BT again and definitely recommend Sky or Virgin over them.~~~,London~~~,2016-05-23~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2
"I switched from Sky to BT a month ago and deeply regret it! BT`s ""Superfast fibre-optic"" achieves` a miserly 5.1 Mps broadband speed  despite their advertised speed of 23 Mps (GUARANTEED!) to 52 Mps. This speed is too slow for HD viewing of my chosen channels. BT admits the fault is ""At our end . . . ."" and are `working on it`. WHAT A RIP-OFF!~~~",Huddersfield~~~,2016-05-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I ordered services from BT and was told the order had failed on their system so they cancelled and told me they would raise again. I then received a call saying they where sorry I hadn't completed my order. Their system said it had been cancelled and not re ordered this is against what I had been told previously. I then stayed with my current supplier. However my credit card showed a charge from BT I called and they have said it will be refunded. They also said I had an active account but would not give me any details as I don't have the account number (I have not received any paperwork from BT after being told the order was cancelled). THe agent I spoke with would not help without me giving them the account number which I don't have. He then became rude when I asked to speak to a supervisor and refused to transfer me he just said he would post the account number and I had to call back. I have spent enough time on the phone with BT and can't believe how unhelpful and how much of a mess they have caused and stress for me on not knowing if I will lose my services. I am also concerned they may try to charge me and it may effect my credit score as I have cancelled the DD. I have not received any services from them and refuse to pay for their errorsI have never felt the need to escalate an issue but this time is different this is the worst service I have ever encountered.~~~,"Braintree, Essex~~~",2016-05-20~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~

We had a very reliable BT service until the end of March when we received a communication the exchange had been upgraded.   Since then nothing but problems with broadband dropout  lights on the hub more flashing orange and orange than blue.  Three engineers later and not a resolution in sight.   The call centre in India are no help making you go through the same procedures time after time.  There is nothing wrong with your line  we may have to charge you.  What about any compensation due from  BT for the inconvenience and frustration experienced.  It is time BT came into the 21st century  we are not all touching our fetlocks saying yes master.   DO SOMETHING - even if we live in a rural area we should not be treated like this.~~~,"Garmouth, Moray~~~",2016-05-20~~~,2,2,2,1
So BT have provided me with 500Gb of free cloud storage  great. However  why can't BT provide customers with a User Guide that is usable to explain how to set-up / configure their cloud solution. A few bad YouTube videos and some appaling material on the net that does not reflect what the customer actually sees on their desktop will just not do.~~~,West Wickham~~~,2016-05-19~~~,3,1,3,2

BT are terrible and have been for many years. I've had to use them twice due to circumstances beyond my control. 18 months into my contract and I'm still waiting for them to install a phone line. Took them 6 months to install internet.  Phoning customer support results in the call being dropped at a guess about 75% of the time. I've had to book days off work just to finish phone calls with BT. I've spent more than 4 hours in one sitting in the past without getting to a resolution (10th May 2016) and today I needed to book an engineer to come out and that phone call took an hour. They've also signed me up to BT Sport for free initially  then started charging me for it. They said they informed me by email  but I receive an email from BT every couple of weeks that contains nothing but spam and so I happened to miss this  which they blamed me for.  Please please please  do whatever you can to avoid them.~~~,Cambridge~~~,2016-05-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely absurd to think I get 1.9mb speed  I spoke to BT just before buying my house 2 years ago and they assured me that works were due to take place to install fibre optic  not a single sign of an engineer  every time I call I'm told it's due to take place in 3-4 months  if I visit my brother in law who lives literally the other end of my road and use his WiFi  I get 55-60mb speed  it's an utter disgrace  not only are they liars  their customer service is diabolical and I cross my fingers that this new law gets passed where customers have to have a minimum broadband speeds. BT hang your heads in shame  yours sincerely a soon to be ex customer(p.a dial up is still head and shoulders above your lousy service)~~~,Weston Super Mare~~~,2016-05-18~~~,1,1,1,1

"The BT broadband is slow and has intermittent faults. Once it did not work for over a week with no compensation(still charged full bill for the service). The speed averaged 3mbps though this could occasionally drop as low as 0.25mbps. When I complained about the speed I was told I could upgrade to infinity for an additional  £20 a month. £57 a month for a decent Internet connection is a lot so I declined. When cancelling(after contract had ended)  I was hit by a hidden ""cease charge"" of £31. At no point during the sign up was I told about this charge  even although I specifically asked for a break down of all costs. The sales team conveniently omitted this fact. What is the purpose of this charge? To me  it seems like BT are on a last rob before I finally leave them. I would 100% recommend you avoid this company until they get their act together and provide a reliable  fast and transparent service.~~~",Northern Ireland ~~~,2016-05-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute garbage customer service.  Do not sign up wit BT. If you're moving home or try to leave BT  they will screw you over.  Instead of accepting their mistake they penalise customers for leaving them.  I'll never use BT ever again.~~~,High Wycombe~~~,2016-05-18~~~,1,1,1,1
We left sky to come to bt  We ordered bt phone and broadband on the 25/4/16  we was told our services would go active on the 10/5/16  the day came  broadband speed was good but then it gradually got worse and worse until we got to the point that we couldn't even change the page  we made numerous phone calls complaining  was told by an Asian woman that we still had 9 days left to cancel if we werent happy  phoned today 17/5/16 which is 10 days after we became active only to be told that we can't cancel as we are out of our 10 days period from the date we ordered  we wasn't told any of that until we tried to cancel  but by have told us we can cancel but they will charge us £350 to end the contract when we was only told 2 days ago that we still have 9 days to cancel if we change our mind but now we want to cancel they want to charge us  we are leaving bt and going back to sky  at least sky are honest  bt are just a big conartist company who like to entrap their customers! Please please please don't go to bt  avoid like the plague  they are crooks  customer service are all Indian people who can't even speak English properly and their services are appalling!!!!~~~,Chelmsford~~~,2016-05-17~~~,1,1,1,1
after giving bt 15 years of being a loyal customer i was forced to go part time at work i phoned them last october to see if there was anything they could help me to reduce the monthly cost they reduced my account by £10 i have now been made redundant and need to move away from my place and live with my brother and sister in law i phoned bt yesterday to stop my service and they are charging me £113.27 until next october they said i changed my contract when i get my own place and get on my feet again i will never ever use bt again for anything~~~,carlisle~~~,2016-05-17~~~,2,1,4,4
I was currently with EE broadband had no issues with them the broadband was just a bit slow. So I changed to BT broadband. Since changing I have had no internet because it won't connect I have spoken to customer services and they say I will have to pay £129 and wait 4 days for he problem to be fixed! I have already paid around £56 first installation fee and also £35 a month. I have yet been able to use the Internet or make any phone calls. Service is unacceptable. I spoke to one of the managers called abhij and he was useless  he had no intention of sorting the issue out fast and for free as BT have already had a lot of money out of me and I have no broadband or phone line. Angry is a understatement.~~~,Derby~~~,2016-05-16~~~,1,1,1,1

Phone works but wifi and BT hub is as much use as a chocolate fireguard. Call out engineer after engineer and they are clueless.  Takes weeks to get someone out and look at it. They are happy to pocket your money with no service.  Hud has more lights flashing on it from red  orange the blue then back to orange again. And they want to charge £28 a year more.

Really poor . 2 months on and hours on the phone  still haven't completely got what I ordered. Appalling customer service. Kind of feel everyone is paid to lie and not do what they say they will. We will certainly be changing provider. ~~~,Uk~~~,2016-05-13~~~,1,1,1,1
BT a complete nightmare to deal with. The engineer did not turn up after me taking time off work. Worst of all has been the poor customer service - they never phone you back when they say they will. At times very difficult to understand what's being said. I was offered £10 compensation  I refused as I considered it an insult after everything I had been through. Once my contract is up I will leave  any other provider would be an improvement.~~~,Western Isles~~~,2016-05-13~~~,1,1,3,3

I echo all of the other comments  I've wasted so much time  and life should not be this difficult.  If I could give Zero starts I would.Advice is NEVER EVER USE BT for TV or Broadband.  Don't say I didn't warn you.As the Bill payer and overall person in charge of such things  there has been anarchy in my household  with 3 adult daughters  and a wife all totally peed off  they have lost all respect and patience  and its all my fault!Counting down so I can leave them.~~~,Carlisle~~~,2016-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Never use this company  their customer service is a joke. I have been on the phone to them for three hours today and am still no further forward. Waited in all day today for an engineer visit  no engineer showed and no phone call to let me know. When questioned on this I have been given a pack of lies ranging from no engineer was booked  to an engineer was booked but did not need access to my property then eventually I have been informed tonight that an engineer was booked but the booking got lost in the system. Please please please do not make the mistake I have made  never sign up for BT broadband~~~,Durham~~~,2016-05-09~~~,1,1,1,1
They will say anything to get you to sign on.  They will reel you in with the cheap  advertising but once signed on they will add little charges here and there.   If you ask them if there would be any additional charges they will tell you no but they will only say that to sign the contract.  After that it will be too late. That's how they got me.  Be careful people.~~~,london~~~,2016-05-09~~~,1,2,2,1

"Have been a BT customer for many years. Have had few problems and overall fairly satisfied. However their impending price hikes are the last straw for me. My research tells me and I'm going for another providers package for about 1/3rd of my current BT Tarrif. The BT new prices email which I got recently promises a 500GB cloud which I don't need  Best Ever security which I don't need either and the promise to fix faults faster....Would much prefer a promise for their customer services to respond more quickly with less dreaded option selections  a lot shorter wait in queues with the constant repeat of the expression ""Your call is important""Also very disappointed with BT sport.After the football season there's likely to be absolutely nothing I'm personally interested in watching~~~",Littlehampoton~~~,2016-05-08~~~,4,2,5,5
Went back to BT as it seemed competitive and quick to get set up. Answered questions on needs  don't watch live streaming download films etc so package sold should be enough.

What a useless company this is today received Email telling me my bill is going up by £4.65 or 11%. No explanation  nothing. When I try to log in to sort out using CORRECT details  it says not recognised so cannot complain. So my bill goes up 10% with no comeback other that to leave...which is exactly what I will do. If you haven't joined BT please please don't. They are a bunch of cheats who despite billions of current year profits have increased current charges by 10% ..or higher. Disgraceful. Andrew Mitchell.

"The worst company ever to deal with.  Sold me a dream and have yet to deliver - a complete nightmare from start to finish.

But wait  Simon calls... Sorry Open reach have directed your line to the wrong exchange (something Simon told me they do often).
