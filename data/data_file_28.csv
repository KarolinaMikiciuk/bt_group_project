if i could of put zero i would i have had problems with BT for a long time i will be reporting them to of com as they take no notice when you complain about the service you get but are happy to take your money. fuming~~~,durham~~~,2017-09-15~~~,1,1,1,1
If I could rate them any lower like -10 I would. For 3 months bt couldnt fix a problem with our internet  every single week we would have to go through an hour long process of registering the fault either by phone or live chat. Everytime they send an engineer they turn up whenever they decide without notification  fiddle with a few things n then say yep all good n not tell us what the problem is. It would work for 10hrs n then starting cutting in and out constantly. After 3 months they found a fault in line and switched us to another  since then (2 weeks) our speed has been pathetic 6 - 7 mbs down n 0.7 mbs up  this is when we pay for fibre optics upto 54mbs. All this hassle has nearly destroyed 2 businesses that need the internet my son has been trying to start and we also have spent hundreds of pounds replacing everything in the house incl phones  cables n a computer.~~~,"bratton, westbury, wiltshire~~~",2017-09-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Shocking service. Broadband infinity speeds of 1.5MB and has been as low as 450KB.BT tell me that fault is due to my internal wiring or router fault.Next door neighbour has same problem.I would be better off on dial up.~~~,Longburton~~~,2017-09-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely awful service. Moved house 2 months ago....still waiting for BT to connect my broadband! Today is the 8th time over the 2 month period that they have moved my connection date! I have had to call them each time to ask why I have not been connected on the promised date  only for them to apologise and tell me that their service is unacceptable... yet they are still to do anything about it! I have now been told connection will not be done for yet another week.  They keep blaming openreach (even though it's part of BT) I've not even had one call off a supervisor or case handler to update me on the situation! The worst company I have ever dealt with!!! Dispicable service!!! I have already contacted the ombudsman service  who will proceed with a case if this is not resolved by the beginning of October.~~~,South Wales~~~,2017-09-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Dreadful wasted an hour on the phone and 25mins online talking. Offered a deal on the phone. went away to think about it. called back that deal doesnt exsist. after a 20min wait they sent to online assistance which were rude and useless they sent me back to the people on the phone which tried sending me back to online assistance. so I'm going to Plusnet. BT = useless~~~,Falmouth~~~,2017-09-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Had appointments of engineer 3 times but never turned up. When I phoned  them  every time I was told there were  errors. Shocking !! Finally managed to cancel the service. I'm so glad I'm with them anymore. It is better not having broadband than their awful service.~~~,Aldershot ~~~,2017-09-12~~~,1,1,1,1
absolutely appalling broadband. go against their own terms and conditions. Stay away from BT. Horrendous and rude customer service. Will not let you out of contract when they guarantee at least 1mb and then your internet completely drops to 300kps ? Then when you ring they try to say it has to be to a wired device   when you tell them yes my laptop is connected to the box like you ask and yet they still try to give some stupid excuse. forget doing anything important even at 1am in the morning when noone else is on the internet and it is still a appalling. Wish i had stayed with sky wasnt the fastest broadband but was a lot more reliable and customer service is 5 star compared to bt.~~~,~~~,2017-09-12~~~,1,1,1,1

"Waited 2 weeks for an 'engineer' to come and set up my internet and tv. Was told that it was all in place the day before he came. When he came he was rude and the internet was not working so he just told me the instructions would be with it all and I would have to do it myself as the line was not working. He failed to feed back to BT that there was a problem. After spending all day on the phone to Indian call centres and having to go through the details time and again  I was told I would have to wait over a week for anyone to come out. I cancelled it all and went to Sky. BT then charged me for ""providing broadband service"" which I never used as I had no broadband! They said I would have to pay it as I didn't give them chance to come and fix it which was because I couldn't wait potentially weeks for them to come back. Their customer services is dreadful. Unhelpful and rude.~~~",Dollar~~~,2017-09-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Shocking  terrible service! Have called over 4 times to change my plan  then when I thought it was all sorted  they have billed me for my previous package i.e. they didn't change my package....so what the hell was I on the phone for hours for?? Also  I'm only allowed fibre optic which is expensive and unreliable. Live in a small one bedroom flat and the wifi doesn't work in the bedroom....~~~,London~~~,2017-09-12~~~,1,1,3,3
"The speed is just below average  low yet reliable  and therefore acceptable as long as you don't play video games.But here is my problem.I just moved address  to do so  BT forced me into a new 12-month contract and offered speed between 6 and 10mb.I am now at the new address and the service is between 1 and 4mb  so under the speed mentioned  so since it is a new contract (forced by them) I have decided to enjoy the 14 days cancellation policy.I was then explained I still had to pay £31 to disconnect the line and £55 for the router.When Challenging these cost  saying I was only canceling because the service was not fulfilled anymore  I was tald it was fulfilled since the ""minimum speed guaranteed"" was only of 1MB.This is a Joke  This is BRITISH TELECOM  our nationnal supplier of telecommunication  and they still find a way to rip people off and refuse to admit fault.Rubbish~~~",London~~~,2017-09-11~~~,1,1,1,2
Had BT Infinity in my area for just about 2 years now  and there's only been a couple times (in last 2 years) where it went down and it was resolved by pulling the plug and starting fresh.  Constant 74 down and 18 up and ping of 20ms. Customer service was pretty average  long-ish queues and simple advice. The broadband is very good though  especially compared to our old 5mb dsl line.~~~,"Perthshire, Scotland~~~",2017-09-10~~~,4,3,4,5
BT Infinity fibre optic broadband - one word...poor. Not a day goes by without the connection dropping out. Speed gets slower in the evening  connection drops and trying to watch programmes via BT TV is hit and miss to say the least. My old standard broadband with Talk Talk was far more reliable!~~~,swindon~~~,2017-09-06~~~,2,2,2,2
Congratulations to BT for chasing another loyal customer of of 25years away  I am looking forward to the day my contract come to an end so I can get rid of this poor poor company . After speaking to 9 different advisors and being giving different prices for there broadband and infinity package I give up . All we were doing was moving house you would think that would be straight forward  but not for bt.Was told we would have to pay a cancellation fee  and take a new package.then we found out we were not in a contract so we would get a refund  now we have told we would  be getting a bill for £31. Then my wife would lose her email address   and after her being on the phone for an hour was told there was nothing they could do as it was already being cancelled   but suprise suprise  if she pays £5 per month she could keep her email address   rip of company  end of my contract can't come fast enough.Stay away from bt for your own sanity..~~~,Highlands~~~,2017-09-06~~~,1,1,1,3
BT are without a doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with. Some of their practises must be bordering on illegal. With so many tech companies out there you would be mad to deal with this company. If I could give a negative star rating  then it would be-10. They will never see another penny of my money or anyone connected to me. Vote with your wallet people.~~~,BIRMINGHAM~~~,2017-09-06~~~,1,1,1,1

Would give 0 stars  or better -5 stars if possible! Choose another provider  even if they happen to be more expensive - which hardly likely.Will NEVER EVER go with BT again and would advise anyone to go with a different provider.Theft in broad daylight; appalling customer service  untrained and unknowledgable staff  rude staff  outrageous pricing; getting customers to pay for 'disconnecting' even though that does not actually happen (had to wait 14 working days after my start date to get connected  because the engineer had 'forgotten to pull the switch to disconnect the previous resident at my address'.~~~,London~~~,2017-09-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute rubbish. Gets to 7pm and slows down to something that makes dial-up look like optical fiber broadband. Been like this for 5 months. Indian call center is annoying. Nothing gets done. Have had some good experiences with UK call staff  but the technical issues remain and can't be fixed. Now moving the Virgin Media with fiber to the door service to ensure I don't end up stuck in another 12 month contract with sub-standard internet.~~~,Leeds~~~,2017-09-04~~~,2,3,1,1
Been with BT for years. I got bt tv installed last year. BT used a 3rd party contractor & second tv with youview has suffered heavy pixellatio for most of the time. Difficult to contact & Indian call centre staff preoccupied with telling you there is a £130 attendance charge despite it being there fault. So far two attempts to rectify have failed & l have had a desultory refund of my second youview box rental charge for the last t months. Enough is enough. If it's not fixed soon l will be off back to Sky. They might cost more  but at least their tv service works & their engineers are properly trained.~~~,Holyhead~~~,2017-09-03~~~,1,1,4,1
Call outs with engineers that never show up as the BT rep didn't confirm it. Lines unstable  replacement router sent but nothing fixed. Never dealt with a more incompetent support team. Any issue has to be 'escalated' and takes days / weeks to get anything started.~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-09-01~~~,1,1,2,1
First of all let me say they are sneaks. about a year ago I asked if they could drop the bt sports package as I don't watch and they said no problem told me my bill will be XX less and I said okay. 5 weeks later they send a letter out saying I signed up to a 24 month contract and when I phoned they said it was too late as it was 5 weeks since i went to the contract (never got an email and they never mention 2 year contract) long story short they wanted me to pay £800 to cancel early. Was never going to happen. Now I wish I could say it ended there but no sadly I am paying for a connection speed i don't get. BT say up to 52 mb connection as I am paying for fibre optics they might as well say up 10 mb least it be closer to what they offer. I am lucky to get 7mb connection at midnight when most people are off.  I have friends next door to maybe paying half the price for virgin media getting 50-100mb. They don't care they give BS excuses as they know I can't leave for another 9 months.  They have so many hidden charges that it's a joke my bill is supposed to be so much a month yet the fail to mention line rental and a number of hidden charges that end up nearly double the price of the package i signed up to. Once this contract is over I am switching to virgin or sky. They don't care about there customers all they see is ££ signs. How can we rip our customers off today. The only good thing i can say is the connection doesn't drop~~~,Derry~~~,2017-08-31~~~,2,2,2,2
By far the worst service I have ever experienced  not even going to bother explaining as every other review covers the exact same crap I went through  after my 12 months is up going to switch to virgin or another provider without hesitation.~~~,London~~~,2017-08-30~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is not want you think. I can think of three services that are excellent in comparison to BT. BT customer service talk the good talk but do not deliver. There are unforeseen extra charges which bump up your budget so making it difficult each month. If you want to get out of a contract it will cost £260. The broadband will stop working for no apparent reason and the phone reception can be distorted with static. Most people I know are with other providers despite the fact that the broadband is 10% less faster. But why? Because the overall customer service is good. One or two good services does not equal customer satisfaction. Very disappointed  very shocked and will not ever go back to BT. Rubbish!~~~,Streatham~~~,2017-08-30~~~,1,2,4,3
My line and Broadband is and has been useless for 15 years. The quality and bandwidth has continued to fall and is now regularly under 1 Mhz. I cannot use any of the products that go with the company advertising and cannot even use I-Player on the lowest quality and yet they are charging me for all these features.This an incompetent and criminal company. There is no alternative for me since the crumbling copper infrastructure is owned by BT. All other ISP's suffer the same since they have to use the same junk. Actually the survey does not reflect my anger since there is no ZERO to be recorded.~~~,"East Boldre, Hampshire ~~~",2017-08-30~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

"Where to start... The TL;DR: - Customer service that does everything it can to dissuade you from logging an issue - Misavertised product - Poor to no connection - Inability to fix recurring issues. For those who want a more involved review: When I signed up for BT Broadband  their website began by steering me towards their Infinity option (30 to 50mb at the time  I think). Then their scan told me I wasn't eligible. I ended up going with the standard broadband package  up to 17mb was the promised figure.I later spoke with an engineer. He said there is no physical way I can ever get more than 3. Less than two months after starting the contract I began to have connection issues. The speed would drop to less than half a mb  or would drop out altogether. Whenever I try to call  I am kept on hold for a minimum of 20 minutes  most often nearer an hour. In the first call  they tried to accuse me of badly wiring the phone lines in the house (i'd just moved in and I don't touch wiring) and said that if this was the case an engineer visit would cost £130.A few words later  an engineer was booked without charge and he later found that the issue was due to a bad installation by the original installer prior to us moving in and due to the pole across the road being overrun with ivy and the box flooded. The engineer spent 2 hours cleaning the pole  fixing the issue.Connection was fine (i.e. 2mb) for another few months  then started having similar issues. Phoned again  was left on hold again for ages  then they asked me to measure my broadband speed in about fifty different ways  all returning speeds between 0.5 and 0.7mb. They put me on hold for another ten minutes  then came back saying there was no problems on their end  but could I do another speed test. Suddenly  2.3mb. Draw your own conclusions there.I am now suffering these issues again  and to top it off they upped my bill three months ago (£33.99 to £41.99) without notifying me. Their excuse... ""You would have received an email"".So... bad to unusable connection  poor customer service  a general inability to fix recurring problems and dodgy billing practices. I am currently making arrangements to switch to Zen. If you like a stable connection and good customer service  then talk to a horse before trying BT.~~~","Cookstown, Northern Ireland~~~",2017-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1

BT is the most unsupportive  badly organised company I have ever dealt with and completely incompetent. The put me on the wrong contract  sent me the wrong equipment 3 times  I could not connect to the internet for 7 weeks and would not help me. I could not get through to Bt spending hours trying to get through when I did manage to get through  BT staff were clueless about my situation. Nobody from BT would phone me back either. But they still kept on sending me bills for a service that I could no use. I have just finished my 1-year contract with BT and I'm going with TALKTALK. BT do not care about their customers or rectify their mistakes. I am so relieved to see the back of BT.

"Just a warning about BT Infinity  the BT Hub becomes a Hotspot which you can not turn off unless you unplug the hub. Do not be surprised if you find people outside your home downloading porn or terrorist stuff from your internet. You could end up with a knock on the door from the police thanks to you giving access to your wireless. As a bit more of an insult you are paying for the electricity they use as well! BT keep very quite about how ""their"" hotspots are supplied  not surprisingly. If you are naive enough to have BTInfinity then always make sure your hub is turned off when not in use and enjoy the 6 o'clock knock from the police~~~",Wales~~~,2017-08-26~~~,1,1,3,1
"I have had a contract with BT for telephone  broadband and mobile (x3 sims) There is not one day that goes by where there isn't an issue with the broadband and phone  mobiles have been OK but charged for extra data usage (owing to having to use more because of poor to no WiFi service!) I have made numerous complaints to BT and not one has been followed up  I get empty promises of phone calls and although customer service staff are apologetic (I genuinely believe they are  but as for the company  they don't give a monkeys) Every time it rains the service disconnects  you cannot imagine the frustration experienced when I lose my work online or my children lose their homework and have to complete again as the the internet cuts out with such regularity. In may this year I made yet another complaint and was advised to upgrade to ""their superfast hub"" nothing could have prepared me for how bad this was going to be!! The situation got worse and  as per previous comments  I was speaking to the Indian call centre ( this in itself is a big communication barrier (no pun intended) being Scottish and hearing impaired it was and is very difficult to communicate in ordinary conversation  add someone from Bangladesh and you have yourself a big dilemma!! So I started using the chat service on BT website (my BT) and one (Indian call centre staff member) representative wrote that I would never attain the speeds BT claimed as I was ""too close to the exchange "" and so I began taking screenshots to prove that BT knew they were selling me services they could not provide! Two weeks ago I wrote to the Ombudsman  I provided them a brief history of my experience and the continued issues and they agreed to look into it. I have heard every excuse in the book but when ""Ollie"" called me this week from BTs British complaint resolution department he told me that the reason for my connection problems was because of my TV Ariel!! To say I was flabbergasted is an understatement  I asked ""Ollie"" if he was having a laugh  (obviously not!!) I then told him I have not got a TV and haven't had one for 14 years and that my Ariel was cut prior to my moving into my home ( +7 years ago) Nonetheless he sent an engineer out for three days later  and when I relayed what Ollie stated he burst out laughing  told me that he was taking the pi$$ and he set about installation of a new line and made sure in was connected prior to leaving  low and behold  I still have a poor to non existing connection  best part is Ollie telling me he would recommend an Ariel installation company for me ""free of charge"" today I received a message from the telecommunications ombudsman to say they are doing a thorough investigation into BT and my complaints and will update me as soon as they have completed it!! Nonetheless BTbare still charging me despite agreeing to STOP taking money from my account!! I would advise anyone considering using the outfit known as BT to do some homework on their services before committing to a contract! I grudge giving them even one star  the whole thing has had me in tears at the lack of understanding  the sheer frustration at giving them almost two years of time to find a resolution and it has been to my detriment. On the plus side there is a service checker on the ifcom website that allows you to check the best service provider in your area  I would advise everyone to use it prior to committing to any contract! BT now refuses to discuss my complaint as it has been escalated to the ombudsman!!~~~",Wimbledon~~~,2017-08-26~~~,1,1,1,1

Just don't do it.  New build took 11 weeks for Openreach to connect. I know some will say its a different company  but given they're BT branded you'd think they could have some sway.  Tried to connect me on 8th August  failed  didn't tell me. Phoned up on 9th  found out about failure  AND an engineer visit they booked which they needed to access my house for.  Got random automated email the following weekend stating I would be connected from the 15th. Phoned up  found our they'd fixed the 'routing problem' offsite... Had booked day off work for visit.  Now connected  but yet to receive the promised call from the complaints department after over a week.
