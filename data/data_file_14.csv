Absolutly disgusted with bt I'm a new broadband customer and my service was supposed to have been activated last Tuesday today a week later still no broadband.After numerous heated conversations and a visit from an engineer I still have no broadband.I have now been told another engineer will be out on Monday..Nobody seems to know what they are doing it's a wonder they have any customers if this is how they treat a new one . I will be cancelling my contract that hasn't even started. You have been warned~~~,Bournemouth~~~,2018-11-12~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have no other option but to get in touch with of ofcom  BT should not be allowed to carry on like this  endless phone calls to bt on my mobile I might add as My landline stopped working broadband works when it feels like it  a month later and open reach has to dig the road up which will be another week. I made a complaint and bt closed it with out even asking  they are a complete shambles!!!~~~,Cresselly~~~,2018-11-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Shocking service  router broke Monday and still waiting for a replacement Thursday. Probably have to switch to Sky.~~~,Buckinghamshire~~~,2018-11-08~~~,1,1,3,1
My advice is to find a different supplier BT is awful & their costomer service is even worse~~~,scotland ~~~,2018-11-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Speed is to low for consistent performance~~~,Newport~~~,2018-11-06~~~,2,1,1,3
Been with bt for 7 years since fibre was available in my area  I’ve got the fibre 2 package which the speeds were up until couple of weeks ago at near max 67mb  then after noticing speed was down to 45mb so I got in touch with them was told by a guy from bt that he sees the problem bangs on his keyboard for couple of mins then says give it 48 hours and it should be back to how it was  48 hours later still the same so I get back in touch with them another guy goes through the same dummy steps and says that he’s put it on record and they will look into it  week later still the same so ring them again and explain it woman says it could be the hub so she will send one out could take 3 days to come  3 days later no hub so get in touch with them again have to go through all the problems again with them even tho it was supposed to be on record so I wouldn’t have to explain! Anyway woman from bt says there is nothing down saying a hub was sent out and she is processing it now to get one out asap so couple days later hub arrives set it up try speed tests and it’s the same  so ring bt back up fella tells me that my speed is just over the minimum 46mb that was agreed with the contract  I try telling him that for all these years it was at max so we got the more expensive fibre 2 package now over time it’s gone down to a speed where a cheaper package would of right for us  But I hate the fact that over these years the internet price has gone up but the speed has gone down  he blamed my neighbors or closer to the exchange etc even Openreach were to blame!! Owned by bt I may add  anyway we agreed to it in contract so it’s tough poo!? Shocking company avoid peeps.~~~,Wrexham ~~~,2018-11-04~~~,1,1,2,2
BT broadband is terrible. My phone works faster on 4G. Keep well away.~~~,Bournemouth ~~~,2018-11-04~~~,1,1,1,1
You will spend just as much time bwing without internet as you will with internet. Every other month you will have a full 2-3 weeks of constant disconnections which wont allow you to get anything done.~~~,Bedfordshire~~~,2018-11-03~~~,1,1,3,1
Very poor. Unreliable more time spent trying to get reconnected. Do not bother~~~,London~~~,2018-11-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Easy to renew contract for phone and broadband.  Broadband speed quoted as minimum of 53 mbps but getting only 30.  Router log shows internet connection dropping out betweeb 20 and 40 times per day  generally during busy periods.  Definitely not getting value for £55 per month.  Telephone on same line having no problem.~~~,"Hook, Hampshire~~~",2018-10-31~~~,3,3,1,1
On my Dads death I took over the BT broadband account only to discover BT were ripping him off over £80 for the basic broadband service. I relayed my utter contempt and disgust and camcelled the service. Do not use BT or deal with this company is my recommendation.~~~,Chiswick ~~~,2018-10-31~~~,1,1,2,2
After ordering bt broadband as i was trying to move from virgin i realised the broadband was no good as i need a fixed ip address and that bt provided revolving ip addresses. I used the broadband 2-3 times just to set it up but as didn't start using it until 2 days after the 14 day cancellation they said i owe them around £400 to cancel. Absolutely ridiculous amount of money for a service i only used to set it up. now they have passed the debt to a collection agency and added 25% so it is now £565.66. i told them numerous times on the phone the service was unusable to me because the ip address was not static. if they had made this clear upfront i would never have ordered but doing so would probably mean less customers so the details were hidden away. I sent all the equipment back with 7 days but they then added an equipment charge on top. I used the broadband to set up 1 pc and never used the phone line at all. how can such a company that prides itself on being a family operator be such an aggressive  venal predator? At some point there will be a debt collector at my door to take my possessions. all because i went 2 days over the 14 days because it was not straight-forward to switch from virgin to bt as i run a home office. THIS COMPANY IS A DISGRACE!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~,Newport~~~,2018-10-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible broadband service. Does not work very well  should have checked the small print.... apparently :-(~~~,Weymouth~~~,2018-10-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Extremely poor signal. Keeps going in and out. Shockingly bad!!~~~,Grimsby~~~,2018-10-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Internet and phone including  for my own experience is just totally wasting of money  I regretted make the contract start at £31 and after got into £34. Don’t make contracts or deals with bt  customers services just crap and unprofessionals   unproductive. The services they provide not value and I’m sure you can find cheaper and better . They are very manipulative without having a clear payment at the end of the monthly also they don’t informed you about the prices going up.~~~,London~~~,2018-10-25~~~,1,1,1,2
Continually bad broadband service. BT told me that there are too many people connecting to the broadband service in the local area at the same time! Apparently this is not their problem! Awful people.~~~,Weymouth~~~,2018-10-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely terrible.  Ordered BT package on the 18th September   chased multiple times to confirm appointments as they had missed two visits. Had phone confirmation  email confirmation and yet they still don't turn up. Now being told 2nd November at the earliest. Still no service then after 6 weeks of ordering. Would not recommend BT to anyone.~~~,Northampton~~~,2018-10-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Well what can i say you see the all reviews 1 star to much for this company i sell my shop transfer the new owner they still wants £800 termination fee no fare~~~,Devon~~~,2018-10-23~~~,1,1,1,1
"BT is a totally unethical company. They hike the price and send a single email giving you 30 days and the email is not clear that the price is going up and you can cancel the contract without any penalties. You only find out once the direct debit goes through showing the higher price. Price hike is more that 15%. I will not be using BT ever again once my contract runs out early next year. When I extended my contact last December it said renew and your price will not increase  be careful as this is not true because any ""general"" BT price hike can still be passed on to you  so not worth the paper it is written on. Do not trust BT at all.~~~",WALSALL~~~,2018-10-22~~~,1,1,1,1
My family has been paying £50 for fibre for the last 6 months. We are getting 50% packet loss and our speed is less than standard broadband. In a futile attempt to ask them to fix it  we had them cut us off on the phone twice and haven’t tried to contact us since. I sent them an email 3 weeks ago with no reply.~~~,Torquay~~~,2018-10-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Hidden charges if you cancel early. called to see how much it would cost to end the contract and they told me £15  the bill came and it was an extra £70 - not trustworthy~~~,Wrightington~~~,2018-10-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Customer service appalling One of the most expensive out there but extremely bad service takes over three weeks just for the engineer to come out and connectOnce connected always problems~~~,London~~~,2018-10-19~~~,~~~,~~~,3,2
Was tricked out of switching - BT agreed monthly to match an equal competitor - they reneged 4mths in..just counting 6 months left of contract so BT can be excluded from my future...BT lost a good customer - they just don't know yet :-D Well done loyalty team ;-)~~~,Bristol~~~,2018-10-18~~~,1,1,4,4
Ridiculous customer service  any given time of the day  any given time of the year. Their broadband diconnects pretty much regularly without any mistakes from our side and when a customer service representative is being asked about any failures they ask “how are we to know what’s going on?”  Their internet is good enough  speed and reach wise but it’s just not worth it. For all the hassle you get more hassle. Main issue is the customer service. Clearly a company that’s only looking to make a quick pound.~~~,Uk ~~~,2018-10-18~~~,2,1,3,2
Haven’t even had broadband from them. Signed up over two weeks ago. Got told I would be connected and have internet by 12am on the 12/10 (over a week after I signed up). Engineer turned up and “sorted” everything. 13/10 and no internet. Get an email saying I’d have internet by 23/10. Both my partner and myself rely on the internet for work. I called them and the person I spoke to advised there was an issue with the exchange and said she has spoken to the engineer manager and manages to pull it forward to the 18/10. Got a text message 17/10 saying it would be the 23/10 again. Called and was advised they could not get an engineer out and I would have to wait for the original date. They will not compensate for the money my partner and I have lost in wages due to having no internet as we are not commercial customers. Called Virgin Media and they said they would send router out and would have internet in TWO DAYS. No engineer required. Never been more angry in my life.~~~,Hampshire~~~,2018-10-17~~~,1,2,1,1
the worst isp we've ever been with. currently getting speeds of approx 0.5mb/s and 600ms ping. called the customer service several times  they have been no help. lost cause of a service. also it became apparent that when we bought fibre optic and they installed it  they were supposed to install a new splitter for the phone/internet line but they left us with an old outdated one. outstanding.~~~,Clitheroe~~~,2018-10-17~~~,1,2,1,1
Approximately a year in contact and all I can say is a year of poor service. First months spent complaining of connectivity but my husband gave up. We get cut off all the time  on acsessability to customed downloads!! Why I ask? Do not choose this provider. I’m so frustrated as my husband has to use his 4g in the house to access email. This can’t be right. Help or advise needed!!!~~~,Kings Lynn ~~~,2018-10-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Absolutely ridiculous service. I have been with BT for years. Recently I decided to change providers because the cost of their service is just ridiculous in comparison to other similar services. After switching provider to the Post Office I received a call from a BT customer support agent. The agent promised me a reduced price at £20 and included a £50 gift voucher to keep me to stay. After 3 months  still no sign of the gift voucher and emails about it ignored. The price has gone up to £24 without any warning. Avoid at all costs.~~~,Southend~~~,2018-10-14~~~,1,3,1,1
BT is a serious thief in this country we  their customer services team are a big lairs wasting our times  I have been suffering from them for more than one year  they not canceling my contract and not fixing the problem  in addition to all that they overcharging me every month and always I have spend many hours speaking with their rubbish team  really we should bring those thief to the court and it must not be allowed steal people  we should not just write a review we should act to bring those to the court  I am going to make claim for compensation  because they did not let me to cancel it~~~,Burton on Trent~~~,2018-10-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
It's so bad. For years it has droped out  slows down and just does not work. We have been with BT for years  it's been really bad for the last five. The support team exists  but they are experts on sending people on a wild goose. We must have spent weeks on the phone with them over the years. Unfortunately  if you leave  you lose your email addresses. So it feels like a bit of a trap. I would advise anybody to avoid if you can  there are much better and more reliable providers for the money.~~~,Dorset~~~,2018-10-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Very disappointed. Raised our price after a yer from 33 to 54 quid  this is ABSOLUTELY ridiculous. By reading more and more reviews I see that that seems to be the problem with everyone all the time. They value drawing in customers and screwing them over and you better be sure as hell that I am NOT coming back to them ever again. You can catch me at TalkTalk getting higher speed  reliability AND lower prices. We're paying for what exactly with BT? Most of the times I'd have my connection drop  their customer service is NO WHERE TO BE FOUND and they screw you over without even notification  an email maybe like HEY dudes  we're gonna raise your internet price with 21 quid now? Naaaah... who gives a crap about the customers themselves right?~~~,York~~~,2018-10-13~~~,1,1,4,3
I am very unhappy with BT.  I have had many problems since joining the latest today is my new expensive iPhone charge is not working after a few weeks of having the phone and Bt said even under warranty they will not replace it very disappointed~~~,Chigwell~~~,2018-10-13~~~,1,1,2,1
The hours i have spent on the phone to this company is beyond belief. AVOID in the end switched to XNL for business very professional and great communications and they answer the phone within 5 seconds. Should the big wigs be brought in front of a parliamentary committee and drilled about why they are providing a unacceptable service!~~~,Worcestershire~~~,2018-10-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely amazing service had no internet since yesterday the bloke came out today to fix it even though we have gale force winds and rain he came 10am and it wosint sorted till about 4pm bless him he'd been out in it all day customer service was amazing too thank you so much BT~~~,Murton~~~,2018-10-12~~~,5,5,5,5
"Avoid this rubbish internet provider. Their service and customer service is useless. I have been having problems with their internet for the last 4 months. Whenever I connect using wifi to any of my devices  it says ""no internet available"". When friends/ family tries to connect to my wifi  it says the same thing. I rang BT on numerous occasions explaining the problem and all they can tell me over the phone is "" they have done all checks on their end and everything is fine from their end"". So there is nothing they can do for me because everything seems fine from their end. They said that I am getting the best signal strength although I am not getting any internet service. Do you know how frustrating it is to be told that an internet provider cannot do anything to try to resolve a problem you are facing because they cannot see a problem on their end? They wouldn't send a new hub or even an engineer to find the problem. Just absolute nothing I got from them with poor customer service. I expected better from a big company but all I got was dirt  considering I am still paying £30 a month for this service I'm not getting and not being able to come out of an 18month contract without having to pay a huge sum to exit. It is unfair  they are unreliable and useless  customer service was beyond poor and staff are rude  unhelpful and speaks to you with attitude. This company has stressed me out to the core. Once they have you  they feel they can take your money and give you 0 to nothing service. I wish I read their bad reviews before I signed up to them or I would have gone elsewhere. This company is a major disgrace. Once I am out I will never go back. Disgusting service  nasty company.~~~",Oxford ~~~,2018-10-11~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Been with BT for over 25 years and the price increased to over £75 pm.  They wouldn't budge on price so I switched. Best thing I ever did. My broadband speed has increased from 13mbps to 21mbps even though I'm on the minimum speed (and I was paying for a premium broadband speed from BT). Cost is less than 50% of what I was paying previously.~~~,Congleton~~~,2018-10-10~~~,2,2,1,3
I bought a 5-day wifi from them thinking that I will be able to connect from home. Although I live in Reading near the centre  there was no signal  not even close.So I called customer support to cancel it and get the refund. They said they can't do it and I need to do it online.I've managed to cancel this wifi online without using it at all  but never got the refund from BT. Poor.~~~,Reading~~~,2018-10-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely terrible customer services! They are billing me more that my contracted sum and cannot get anyone from customer services to resolve the matter. BT clearly do not value their customers and from my experience are totally incompetent at dealing with customer services issues.~~~,North East~~~,2018-10-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,1
Absoloute crap. Never had anything like it. Says it is connected but that is horse****.drops out every five minutes  requiring you to sign completely back in.wont load anything.wont let you send or receive your ******* messages. And I’m paying over £90 for this ****. Would never recommend. EVER.~~~,London~~~,2018-10-04~~~,1,1,1,1
BT business i would never recommend this company they are not flexible at all and do not UNDERSTAND if your having probelms no compromise no help no negotiation just disgusting the experience I have had. Try other providers not BT. They just plain black and white I would say whether you can afford or not complete your full term length dont care or want to listen to your probelm. Manager was absolutely disgraceful I found.~~~,~~~,2018-10-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
