fast broadband when working  connection drops out on average 10 times per day usually at most inconvenient times. You can always contact customer service of course if you have a spare hour or so and they will do everything within their power to NOT solve your issues  tell you there could be an extra charge and try sell you other products that you neither want nor need. In my area they are the only provider of superfast broadband meaning for now I haven't much choice but to stick with them but as soon as ANY other company can provide internet I will be changing. I would strongly recommend anyone else over BT.~~~,York~~~,2016-03-22~~~,1,1,4,1
Very poor due to line fault. Repeated connection failures. BT show little interest and will not check line without me agreeing to pay 'when' fault is found in my equipment. Review of line indicated to be in about a week maybe..~~~,Southampton~~~,2016-03-22~~~,1,2,1,1

"Allow me to explain my rating...  Unfortunately the minimum is 1 star. The reason this is unfortunate is because I cannot tell you what the speed or reliability is like. After 8 months  I still do not have BT internet.  My flatmate and I have spent an astonishing amount of time on the phone in order to reconcile some sort of service (any will do at this point) from one of the most poorly run organisations I have come across. We have both lived and worked globally and this is the worst company I have dealt with. It is an organisation which is about as reliable as Tony Blair's promises. Back in July 2015  we purchased BT internet on a bundle with BT sport. We waited a month or so to be connected but got nowhere. BT could not connect our wifi and they said they would send an engineer out. They then texted to say ""apologies  this our mistake  we will cancel the engineer"". They did not cancel the engineer. Instead  they charged us £130 for the engineer.  We used to have BT Sport. They stopped our subscription around Christmas because we haven't paid our wifi bill. We have had no wifi.  After about 28 phone calls  with an average wait time of 50 minutes each time  they actioned a formal complaint on our behalf. they said they would call us back. Guess what..? I urge anyone  in fact no  I beg EVERYONE to not purchase BT wifi. You will be making a grave error. If you choose to ignore this advice  then best of luck. You'll need it.~~~","Chelsea, London~~~",2016-03-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Tend to get knocked off-line once or twice a week though it does re-connect very quickly.Checked speed today - 37.51Mb - this is supposed to be infinity fibre optic!~~~,Glossop~~~,2016-03-22~~~,3,2,3,3
I placed an order as a new customer with BT for TV  Broadband and Telephone services back in February all I can say is that I'm not yet a customer and I've already experienced what can only be described as complete and utter incompetence from BT. I phoned today to enquire as to why I had not received any communication with regards to my order  only to be told that there was a problem with my existing phone line which was being seized by my current provider. This meant an engineer that was due to call on at the end of the month wouldn't now call while my services with my current provider are due to cease next week. And yet no-one from BT contacted me to advise of this. I was then tersely told by the BT advisor to contact my current provider to inform them that I won't be moving to BT so ensure my line will be released. And yet I already informed my current provider over a month ago that I was ceasing with their services  would be having my direct debit cancelled after the 28th and have also had my last payment with them adjust accordingly to reflect the termination of my contract with them. And yet BT are asking me to contact them to restore my line because of BT's incompetence. And worse is that I had a conversation with BT 2 weeks ago to inform them that my current provider wouldn't release the line (which meant I couldn't keep my telephone number) but I was told by the rather cocky advisor that everything would be fine (inc being issued with a new number) and that my order would go through and that my BT services would commence at the end of this month. It was also during this conversation that I was informed that my previous order with BT  placed online  would be cancelled and replaced by a new order which result in further savings for me compared to my previous online order. So  I'm not even a customer and I'm already experiencing problems with BT which doesn't bode well for the future. I should have heeded the warnings from some of my friends who said BT were a nightmare to deal with. All I can say is DO NOT move to BT. They are frankly useless!~~~,WORCESTER~~~,2016-03-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Similar to other reviews - after waiting 3 weeks for a date they gave us  the engineer visit was cancelled without warning and it was impossible to get through to anyone who knew what was going on. The order call centre is in India and staff had trouble understanding English let alone why our order had been cancelled. After speaking to about 6 different people and a week later we found out that an Engineer would not need to visit after all (although the 5 people prior said they did  which would have meant another wasted day off work)  when the broadband was set up but would need to go to the local exchange  however BT were stating that Open Reach kept cancelling the order every time they tried to re-place the order. We still don't have broadband but apparently they are still trying... I would avoid BT broadband at all costs as have never had this trouble with any other providers. It is clear that their systems do not work and their staff training would appear to be terrible with people not understanding the basics of how their service works. If anyone from BT reads this  your live chat is also awful. It can say that you have 8 minutes waiting time until the next agent but it regularly reaches the end of the countdown but still  spends ages  searching for an agent. At this point you are without a countdown or idea if someone will respond  or you have dropped off the waiting list.~~~,Dorset~~~,2016-03-21~~~,1,1,1,1
This company should not be trading. They are arrogant  rude  threatening and just supply a poor shoddy service. I am paying over £30 monthly for a standard broadband connection of 1meg  this is discounted and should be nearer £40. New BT fibre  which has just arrived here is £10+phone so I asked to change. Nope  you can't have NEW  so please pay us £25 +phone!!! Not a chance  so moving elsewhere. Since I notified them of this  I have been called or emailed every day. Threatening letter covering extra charges for loads of things that MIGHT happen. I will NEVER go to BT again. Look after your existing customers BT  it will reap dividends in the end.~~~,Doncaster~~~,2016-03-21~~~,1,1,1,1
The most horrendous service! I've had 3 BT hubs over 18 months and my internet cut out dozens of times during the day. No one at BT seems to speak English and they get very annoyed when you ask them to repeat themselves as you couldn't understand them. I was told to perform repair checks myself and was given an automated helpline number which apparently talks you through the process of fixing it. It goes on about wires  circuits  cables etc  which I know nothing about. I have dyspraxia and I'm not good with anything practical at the best of times. When I rang BT again  they told me to get my screwdriver and unscrew the phone socket box. When I told the guy I didn't own a screwdriver as I can't use one  he got very annoyed and told me to out and buy one. He kept ringing me every day for several days but I couldn't answer my phone as I was at work  like most people between 9-5. When he finally got hold of me  again  he was very rude and told me he had been trying me all day. I told him I was at work and he had the cheek to tell me that he tried my mobile but I didn't bother answer that either. Again  I told him I can't take personal calls at work. He was very hostile and rude. Nothing got done and I've now changed to Virgin. I'd rather never have wifi again than go to BT. Awful company! Don't even deserve 1 star!~~~,Lancing~~~,2016-03-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Appauling isp. Our download speed was deliberately reduced in May 2015 from 0.9mb to 0.3mb and now we only have an infrequent connection. BT and their pals Openreach and the Ombudsman are all in cahoots and blame each other. So much for the governments promise of highspeed broadband for all - feel as if we live in a third world country.~~~,Leominster~~~,2016-03-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute joke of a company. Engineer was supposed to come between 8-1. Got to 1.30 so I called BT and they said the engineer booking failed. Had no explanation  no apology. I had no call or email to let me know of this change.  Not one person I spoke to was English  I couldn't understand a word they were saying. In total was on the one for 2 hours! JOKE never join BT~~~,Worthing ~~~,2016-03-16~~~,1,1,1,1
"Had an issue with my fibre optic internet as speed that were initially excellent dropped to a level that were somewhere between dial up and slow broadband (closer to dial up).  Suspecting a problem with the crap BT homehub 3 I phoned BT and was actually told ""that's just the way it is"" basically ""live with it"".  I changed the wireless router for an ASUS model and presto the hi speed fibre optic internet was back.  Now the whole inifinity network has gone down where I live and yet when you do the on line service test it shows ""no problems in your area"" - which kind of contradicts the ""service status"" page on the website that shows that there is.  2 days and no internet - all they do is push it back another 4 hours every time they miss a deadline.  Omni shambles.~~~",Swadlincote~~~,2016-03-15~~~,2,1,5,3

"On the 24th Feb 2016 I ordered BT broadband and phone line  a short while after I received an order confirmation text with a reference number. A few days after  four times in a row I was told by BT's customer service  someone will get back to me by 20:00 the following day  on each ocassion  I never received a phone call. I called BT and told them to cancel my order. It was then they decided to pull their finger out of their ass and make progress (I had no intention in going any further with their services at this point  but gave them a second chance). They cancelled the order (the date of this ""progress"" 5th March 2016) and placed another one...NO CHANGE! Today 14th March 2016  I called BT and told them to cancel my order  I don't want anything to do with them  they asked why  I told them my service isn't even up and running yet and the lack of your communication is nasty! Irresponsible! Unethical! And unprofessional for an organisation of your calibre. They finally cancelled my service  what I will say is I've been with Sky for several years and never had a problem with customer service  the reason why I wanted to change was because they never gave me a good enough deal with the package I had in comparison to what other people I know was getting  however  after what I experienced with BT! I'm staying with SKY  one thing I forgot to mention  there were two ocassions when I called BT  they left me hanging for 46 and 45 minutes respectively.~~~",London~~~,2016-03-14~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"From the outset: I have *no* commercial connection with BT  and - as I live abroad - am not even a BT customer myself  but merely administer my ageing mother's UK account on her behalf. Reading the litany of dissatisfaction in the comments posted here  I really wonder if we are talking about the same company. Having  extricated my mother from the clutches of TalkTalk some years ago (now *there's* a company to steer clear of  if ever there was one)  I switched her to BT and have been more than happy ever since. Sure  there are some niggles (like the so-called ""International Freedom"" chargeable add-on which is actually capped at 600 minutes per month and so should be re-named accordingly)  but by and large we have no cause for complaint. The phone lets us make and receive calls when we need to; the broadband (which I use when I'm staying with her) is fast  reliable and reasonably priced  with no usage limit; and the bills add up as they should. When we need to contact support staff  e.g. to renew or modify my mother's contract  we find them helpful and efficient. Which  incidentally  is more than I can say for many a vastly more expensive media / telecoms company over here in Switzerland. So why not give BT a break  folks?~~~",Nottingham (Zurich)~~~,2016-03-14~~~,5,5,5,5

I have requested BT to have a look at he issues I face whilst using the broadband. First time they did the line test and asked to open up the socket and check they concluded there was some issues with the line coming into the property external work done on the pavement had buried the junction box and when it rained the connections got crossed. It has now been six months and I still get intermittent connection. Bt have not been helpful and requested payment of £100 to look into this reoccurring problem. I pay all my bills but am not getting the high service I was promised in the original contract. I have also sent them details via their website when connection is there. Please fix this~~~,Harrow~~~,2016-03-13~~~,1,1,2,1
Do not buy any BT services. After being with Sky for years we decided to change to BT for the BT Infinity service. Took 1month and 2 engineers (one of which disappeared during the job without saying and without solving it) to connect. After that we were put on a completely different package where we accrued data usage fees. Promised to remburse us but never happened. Trying to sort out the problem was a nightmare. So many phone calls without resolution. There followed dozens of phone calls  where we were cut off often and we were back to square one. 6months down the line  still getting charged for a service that we were missold. Cancelled and gone back to Sky  should never have left. Appealing customer service and rip off merchants.~~~,Warrington~~~,2016-03-12~~~,~~~,~~~,1,1

The biggest mistake I have made is signing up to BT. The company are a joke and it's an embarrassment that they are a British company.First there was a problem with my order which I thought they had quickly sorted.Then my services were not installed when they said they would and after countless missed dates was eventually up and running 5 weeks later.Once my broadband was up and running I realised my BT TV service was not working and called only to find that had been wiped from my order so had to phone to get that sorted.Once this was sorted the next day my TV package was not the one that I ordered (channels not activated).Once this was sorted I phoned to check that my billing would be as per my order and not at the current prices as they had risen. Was told my billing would be at current price and not as per my order with the offers at the time (2 months prior). I was told this would be corrected and prices would be as per my order.Every bill since has been wrong and was told I would be reimbursed on my next bill only for that to be wrong.....and so on and so on.I have not received my £100 voucher as promised and have chased this up being told it would arrive within 30 days and then 10 working days....... still not arrived.My broadband stopped working and was told this would be fixed within 3 days and 5 days later it is still not working and had no update or info from BT. Can't use broadband BT TV  Netflix  now TV  playstation plus. So I'm paying for all these services I can't use.BT are shocking and I have phoned to cancel my contract only to be told I have to pay £206 (remainder of contract). Next step is the ombudsmen for me to get out of this sham of a company.WARNING......stay away from BT at all costs they will make you pull your hair out and customer service is non existant and no help. In 4 months I have spent around 10 hours on the phone to BT to sort out the issues I have had. I had be with sky for 8 years and plus net 8 years before BT and never had a problem. I can't wait to get out of this BT hell and will be more than happy to pay the extra £10 a month and get back to sky.~~~,wiltshire~~~,2016-03-05~~~,1,1,3,1
"BT is literally the worst broadband company in the world  I would even give it 1 star for all categories. We've been having gigantic problems with our broadband for the past 2 months. We've tried to contact BT multiple times for help and solutions  but all we get is some person telling us they are going to ""monitor"" our connection for a few weeks. I don't want that  I want a reliable internet service that can give me more than 0.25mbps 90% of the time. I do not recommend BT to anyone who is buying broadband. Worst. Company.

Poor service  no respect for customer! When we changed to BT we explained that the line and broadband would b used for business and we need a guarantee of a reliable service. Today Ive been told that who ever set us up didn't put us on a business plan and that now we have to wait until Monday for a phone call (which I was promise to recurve today as the fault was reported yesterday) to let us know when problem will b sorted.  So if you are  thinking of changing or getting BT (BT infinity) don't bother! Go with SKY.~~~,Southampton~~~,2016-03-04~~~,1,1,1,1
I'm disappointed at the customer service BT provides. It is a joke to wait almost a month to switch the broadband from one place to another.

Amongst others in our estate we are 200 yds from superfast broadband  yet cannot access it  and our own BT 'speed' averages 1/8 of what is promised and 1/3 of other providers. Service here is only marked a '2' as people on the phone are polite  but they reside in another country  have no accountability and basically the whole set up is a disgrace  as well as a joke given that our town is advertised as a shining exemplar. The truth is the service is highly patchy and I obviously reside in barren ground  so much so that my BT download was so slow last week that I had to get someone to physically post me a file on a disc.

i have to type twice this review bacon BT wifi sucks! We have to wait for a MONTH to get a modem. A MONTH! everytime when we called the customer service we have to wait for 30min-1hr to get through the operator  to find out that our home address is wrong. even when we changed the address  the MODEM never came. we have to call the customer service for 10x and wait for a month before FINALLY getting our modem. we use BThub5 infinity  but the line is always disconnected  and sometimes it is so slow.

They should be taken to court and sued.  Any time they can their customer service team are rude and arrogant  don't listen and actually lie about other service providers to scare you into staying with them.  I would actually go without broadband and telephone just to stop giving them any more money.  They are obviously sticking to a script and have been trained in sales techniques in the guise of customer service!  The same techniques were used to sell ppi and I guess the experts have now moved on to train but customer services!~~~,Orkney~~~,2016-03-02~~~,1,1,1,1

They are of no interest of helping you they just want any excuse to take money off you for service your not getting. Moved house and took 2 weeks to get my service back and still had to pay for the service I wasn't getting plus extra. I will never be going to thus company again. I would be happy to pay more to a company that cares about their customers and receive good service ect. They don't even deserve a penny in my eyes.~~~,Norwich~~~,2016-02-29~~~,1,~~~,1,1
BT has recently plumbed the depths of incompetence with regard to technical support and customer focus.I have put up with years of needing to re-boot my hub upto 3 times a day and facing hours on the phone to an Indian call centre. A new hub was offered along with a statement that the fee would be waived even though I was not under an annual contract  I stated that I had had enough of their service  a hub 3 turned up anyway and despite returning it BT  billed me anyway  since they work entirely on PoP and not serial numbers and did not accepted that I had been told that the fee would be waived.A BT employee rang to put matters right and I agreed to rejoin - a hub 4 duly arrived and the service was actually quite reliable.An associate BT company then took over my service without any notification - it took India 2 hours to work out why my BT service had suddenly failed. The associate company stated that even though I did NOT even have a contract with them they would not do anything about the takeover and I should contact BT Wholesale - I gave BT Retail another go due to the reliability of the new hub 4.After a period customer support then recommended that if I cancelled my very latest BT contract then I could go for fibre in a couple of days - he would ring me back then - no ring back - the guy had obviously realised that there is no fibre for my street for NINE months.Tried again - standard broadband can actually be put back in place within a week! SMS - sorry there's been a delay - please wait another 9 days. 3 more calls to customer support (including 1 obnoxious guy in an Indian call centre who kept stating that it was entirely down to BT Wholesale and he could not even chase it). Fortunately another customer service's rep did chase it and an expedited service request went through and was accepted - unfortunately this only led to a 1-2 day improvement. Still thus waiting for re-instatement - something tells me that I should have just put up with re-booting my 'hub 2' multiple times a day!!If you were thinking of joining BT please take my advice and use another provider - ANY OTHER PROVIDER - at least if you do not want to spend hours on the phone to customer services (largely really nice  if not always competent people) and technical support (they like to follow their scripts no matter what)!!!~~~,Bexley~~~,2016-02-29~~~,1,2,3,3
