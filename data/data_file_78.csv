In 12 months with BT I only got speed of 0.8 mbps. I was supposed to be able to get 3-5 megs but only got that speed when I complained  even then it lasted only a day or two before going slow again. They lied constantly  never gave anywhere near a good service and deliberately slowed the speed down to 0.13 mbps when they found out I was switching to someone else. Absolute rubbish service  product. They seem to be more concerned with advertising their products rather than providing a good  reliable service.~~~,London~~~,2010-05-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Poor speed and disconnects of its own accord. Pay for 8mb and recieve a high 1.5  finally called BT and they said we where in a low demand area  although we are in a high competitive area  was also informed on upgrade the connection was due to be upgraded  this was 4 years ago???? Seriously considering changing to another provider~~~,Aldershot~~~,2010-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1
"Broadband speed is extremely inconsistent - varying from 4Mb+ to 0.5Mb-all the time. BT tech employees all appear to be in India with consequent language problems. Despite numerous complaints no lasting improvement has been achieved.The problems always seem to be blamed on ""work"" going on at the exchange!~~~",Aberdeen~~~,2010-04-26~~~,2,2,1,1
I have been with BT Broadband for 3 years now and complained as I was only getting half a MB speed. BT kept telling me I was too far away from the exchange  I have since found out I had a tag on the line and BT removed this so I am now receiving about 2 MB. It is a shame they did not sort this out from the begining so that I could have not had to suffer such a slow down load speed and made numerous phone calls. My advice is do not give up and keep on at BT until they send out an engineer who can test what speed your actual line is capable of on their meters.I also suggest you ask them to check if your line is capped or tagged! Hope anyone reading this can get their service improved like I have as customer service gives lots of conflicting information and occasionally you will get a good BT staff member who goes out of their way to help you instead of consistently being fobbed off.Thank you BT for eventually sorted it out and can I get a refund?~~~,Luton~~~,2010-04-22~~~,3,~~~,3,3
Beats Freeserve/orange hands down. Very easy and efficient change over.Much faster up and down loads.~~~,Oakley~~~,2010-04-05~~~,4,4,4,5
NONE of the categories has proved to be worth even a SINGLE star  and to rub salt into the wounds  I'm locked into the contract for 18 months. Use BT at your COSTLY peril~~~,"Burntwood, Staffs~~~",2010-04-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I'm sad to even give BT 1 star. there service is appauling  they lie and when not lieing to the customer and trying to explain very bad speeds they either havent got a clue or try to balme it on you. At one point i was told to fix it my self from now on and another instance left on hold for 6 hours. I got 6-7 mbs when i frst joined on an 8 meg line now i have 20 meg and get from 76kbs to 1.7meg. I would stear well claer from BT as its some times hard to understand there customer support because of there very strong foreign accents. BT realy dont even deserve a star. Terrable service speed and they havent a clue at all.~~~,Hastings~~~,2010-03-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Been with BT now TOO LONG absolutely rubbish connection and customer service  we are annoyed that BT are charging for a service which they are not giving considering how much they make there is no excuse for poor connection problems  deeply dissatisfied~~~,milton keynes~~~,2010-01-24~~~,1,1,1,1
BT's Broadband speed is far  far too slow.  Getting through to Customer Service is a time consuming nightmare.  All in all  a desperately poor service.~~~,Cheadle Hulme~~~,2010-01-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I live in the Lagan Valley (the largest populated area in Northern Ireland)and my Broadband Speed varies between 0.310mb and 0.120mb  BT's charter stipulates that all households would have a mimnimum speed of 0.512mb by 2009. I am registered Disabled and use my computer for shopping etc. My computer is only one year old running Vista.  BT are absolute rubbish at getting anything done to speed my broadband up. They are helpful on the phone but useless on the ground.~~~,Donaghcloney Craigavon Co Armagh NI~~~,2010-01-20~~~,1,4,1,4
Speed less than 1MB in our area! Pointless going to other Broadband providers if the BT line is hopeless  which is really frustrating. Hopefully when BT finally get around to installing Fibre Optic cable it will even out the playing field more.Did not tell us contract had expired after one year! Technical department in India as usual & sounds that far away on the phone. Hopeless with MACs as well. Just moved to Virgin so we will see how they do!~~~,ickenham~~~,2010-01-08~~~,1,~~~,1,3
the speed is absolutely appalling-480k upload 350k download and is sold as up to 8MB.~~~,"great Bromley,Colchester,Essex~~~",2010-01-05~~~,1,~~~,1,3
BT Yahoo is the internet connection I use.  I have Option 3 for the internet connection and full week no cost for land line calls on a BT line. It works OK but I'm certain it is not the most I could get from BT for the money I am paying.~~~,"Rochester, Kent, UK~~~",2009-12-23~~~,3,~~~,3,4
Have had an issue about speed with BT since I switched to them.People next to me on same company are getting between 2.00 and 3.00MB I was getting 0.9 at good times. Have complained to BT who sent an engineer out to test the line and said nothing wrong with your house wiring system and nothing wrong with the line to the house  I asked about the other peoples speed he said just one of those things. When he left my speed has now gone to 1.6 now strange that it has but still not good enough as the engineer said I should be getting three.~~~,Woodborough Nottinghamshire~~~,2009-12-22~~~,3,3,~~~,4
best download speed 0.83mbps and upload 0.32mbps pretty hopeless.Most video clips wont play properly  stop start all the way through only getting 1 tenth what I should be really I should be only paying for what I'm recieving 50p a month trading standards maybe?~~~,Cumbria~~~,2009-12-22~~~,~~~,3,1,~~~
evening speeds are down to less than 512 and transfer rate almost none and exchange 200yds away as crow flies. daytime speed ok about 4.5~~~,canterbury kent~~~,2009-12-22~~~,3,4,3,4
These guys haven't a clue  everytime I need to speak to someone it's an hour long extravanganza of redirected phone calls  ultra-poor classical music while I'm on hold and one mistake after another. My internet connection was capped at 2Mbs for 4 weeks and even engineers couldn't suss it until they spoke to the exchange who just 'noticed' it was them that was capping it!~~~,mlton keynes~~~,2009-12-18~~~,1,1,3,~~~
we 're supposed to get 20mb but are getting less than 1/2 a mb~~~,chorleywood~~~,2009-12-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Much too slow broadband speed. Customer service (if you can contact anybody) practically non-existent. Utterly hopeless. I am thinking of changing. I am paying BT for 8 Mb and getting an average download speed of 1.87 Mb and an average upload speed of 0.32 Mb. This is absolutely pathetic.~~~,Noble~~~,2009-12-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Option 3 un-capped. However  it appears to be capped at 300k/s d/l speed. BT should have it's virtual monopoly on lines removed  I do not recommend them.~~~,kinross~~~,2009-12-14~~~,~~~,~~~,1,3
BT claims 8mb but I have never had more than 0.9mb even though they claim I should get 1.5 on my phone line I have tested it on quiet times so there are no excuses about too many people using Broadband in this area.. When I put in the post code they claim 4mb. Come on BT you should be able to do better thasn this~~~,Woodborough Notts~~~,2009-12-07~~~,3,3,~~~,4
customer service very very poor un able to achieve download speeds promised when signing contract~~~,wrexham~~~,2009-12-06~~~,1,1,1,1
BT provides a below average service  it's rather like all services in a rural area  there aren't any. You have to live in a city area to get the rated service. This will always be so  where I live the majority of the population are sheep.~~~,LLANIDLOES~~~,2009-11-27~~~,1,~~~,~~~,1
Despite all the adverse criticisms sites like yours like to promulgate  I have found BT very responsive to requests for help with problems and overall to provide a quite acceptable service~~~,East wellow~~~,2009-11-26~~~,4,4,3,4
As usual advertised speeds of 8Mb don't even come close to the actual figure of 1Mb even though i am quite close to the exchange.  If this god forsaken town had any choice when it came to suppliers I would change without hesitation.~~~,Whitehead~~~,2009-11-22~~~,~~~,3,~~~,3
Very poor service I have complained that I only have 512mbs. The answer was that was enough for my needs~~~,Tarvin Cheshire~~~,2009-11-19~~~,1,1,1,1

speed is very poor .7meg   computer locks up frequently  often have to close down and log in again as the broadband fails.  Once bt have you signed up for 18months they couldnt give a toss   help desk in india  WHAT A FARCE!!!!!!   trying to get any sense makes you suicidal   i despair~~~,emneth~~~,2009-11-15~~~,1,1,1,1

the speed that BT advertise is by no means reflected iin their actual broadband provision. I have had nothing but a slow connection  resembling the old 'pay as you surf' days- since we switched from Orange. A move I regret making.~~~,sheffield~~~,2009-11-13~~~,1,1,1,~~~
I have never had a problem connecting to BT  its always up and running  but I am paying for an 8mg service and I am getting 512kg at best....for reliability excellent  for speed rubbish.~~~,isle of wight~~~,2009-11-13~~~,4,4,1,5

I was mis-sold BT Broadband. I have complained without result. I have many further complaints relating to apathy  incompetence and downright lies. For far too long I have tolerated an incredibly poor  often non-existent  service. Support has been lamentable. I am currently preparing a file for the Chairman and CEO of BT  with a copy for Ofcom.~~~,"Moortown, Lincolnshire~~~",2009-10-28~~~,1,1,1,1

we pay for unlimited but do not get it thay call it unlimited until you use it alot then they restrict your speed and call it fair usage policy i call it taking the p###~~~,hastings~~~,2009-10-23~~~,1,3,1,~~~
Speed only inceases for a short time after a complaint has been made to the help desk. I have to monitor my broadband speed weekly for performance. I have had a BT engineer who tested my line at 3+ Mbs loopback with a CRC of zero errors. However the max download I have achieved today is 2.1 Mbs. Although at present I'm back at 1.1 Mbs. If it was not for my Bussiness E-Mail address I would move providers.  The Bt Help desk ( India) is one of the biggest wastes of time both trying to understand the poor english spoken and the constant referral that it is my equipment that is the cause of the problem.~~~,Chippenham Wilts~~~,2009-10-22~~~,1,1,1,1
