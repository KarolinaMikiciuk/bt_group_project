"BT fibre box at our gate but not ""available"" after a year  then charged £730 / year for lowest non-fibre package inc  2 landline charges for same line to get a phone & limited (12 Gbytes/month).

"The Wpic saga of trying to get our broadband connected continues.  After being notified that we were to be connected on the 12th of Dec by midnight  then notified again by text on the 13th of Dec that we were to be connected  I called early on the 14th to find our order was ""fake"".  The whole order had to be re-processed (it had already been delayed by five days).  Our new date is the 2nd of Jan.  Highly annoying with two kids to entertain (Netflix)  visiting parents who want to Skype and expensive having to purchase extra phone memory.  Cheers BT for nothing.  The call centre has been a customer service disaster zone.  My advice avoid BT like the plague for broadband  there's a reason they rank so poorly in reviews.  They've certainly tarnished our Xmas to a degree.~~~",Essex~~~,2017-12-15~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~

Router Doesn't work with Macs. [Managed to write that sentence before; for the 8th time in the last hour the router crashed for everything - so let's hope I can post this].I'm out of contract now - so going to dump BT ASAP  I'd like to compare providers on the Web.....but the advantage BT have - is the Web is just a legend hidden behind wires that go nowhere. Oooh - I have a connection  so I'll try to hit send!! Nope  I tried to check my text  and the connection was lost again. Blue!.. send....~~~,Bristol~~~,2017-12-14~~~,1,1,1,1
God only help you if you ever have a problem with your internet service. When it's all running smooth I can't really complain  pretty standard internet. The problem with this abysmal company is the customer support. What an absolutely agonising ordeal you have to go through with a bunch of un-trained monkeys. Yes  absolute monkeys reading out of a book.About half a year ago I had exactly the same problem - my internet dropping off and spiking up and down aswell as my router restarting itself. Last time I had to go through the cycle of Indians (people i sincerely CANNOT understand) and wait three weeks for an engineer. This time however I was greeted by a decent sounding guy called Liam  who clearly lived in the UK. These people DO NOT want to help you at all! They are working for probably next-to minimum wage pressing buttons trying to fob people off. Absolutely ATROCIOUS service. It took 5-10 minutes of tests and stuff just for this man to tell me everything looked okay  but when I argued with him and asked ''Surely you can see my connection dropping on your screen'' his reply was just ''Yes  I can''. Soon after this  I was then told I could get an engineer out to my house! (yay!)... Shortly followed by ''but if the fault doesn't lie within BT's end  you'll be charged £130''. I really have nothing else to say about this absolutely disgusting company. DO NOT Entertain getting internet from these apes.~~~,Worcestershire~~~,2017-12-13~~~,2,1,2,2
"Pasting the e-mail I sent to BT below: Dear Sir or Madam  I am not sure where to begin. I have suffered two panic attacks today  cried a lot and spent 4+ hours on the phone and on online chat to your advisors. The service I have received is absolutely disgusting. I cannot believe the customer service team at such a big firm is so useless and incompetent. It all started when I wanted to submit an order for moving home. My address was not on the list so I had to do it over the phone. After waiting an insane amount of time I was redirected 5-6 times to different teams. Finally  it seemed like I am seeing light at the end of the tunnel. A very nice lady promised me she submitted my order and that she booked in an engineer for 2nd Jan. This was not ideal for me but it was the best they could do. She also assured me my new address has the fiber service available. At this point I thought it was done. After not receiving an email with my order for 15 mins I decided to check my online account. Surprise - the offer said rejected! I immediately called again. This time it only took 29 minutes to reach the correct team. We started again with the order - it turned out my new flat does not have fibre and would not be able to transfer my current broad band and TV package. The lady suggested some other options which were available - at this point I agreed to anything. I was crying on the phone and I just wanted to sort things out. She then says my engineer appointment would now be 9th Jan. At this point I was breaking down - this meant I could not work for an extra week (I use WiFi for my job). I had no other option - I had to agree. She then put me on hold and the waiting began once again. After long 17 minutes she says: ""Im sorry but it appears I cannot submit this order  I really have no idea why."" As you can imagine  the 9th of Jan slot now seemed like a dream - it seemed like even in February I will not have internet. This was my breaking point and I decided to cancel my contract all together. The assistant told me since you can no longer provide me the same services at my new home I will be able to cancel free of charge with a 30 day notice period. This meant I would pay some extra weeks but I didn't care. We agreed the services will stop on 2 Jan and I will pay until 12 Jan. She told me it's done and wished me to feel better. I think she actually really felt bad that I was crying because of the obvious incompetency of these people.After the call I was beginning to calm down. The contract was cancelled so I went ahead and arranged another firm. I was scrolling through my emails when I saw my confirmation of stopped services. I was relieved. I did not want to even open the email - I had such hatred in my head still. But I opened it - and almost had a heart attack. The email said my services will stop on 20th December?????? Not only that but as a Christmas present maybe I had to pay almost £700. Imagine my shock. Immediately  for the 16th time that day I connected to the online chat. Of course they couldn't help because I needed the FTTF team. And so the waiting to connect to this magical team began once again. This one was actually not too bad - only 14 minutes. I gave my details and the agent said she will check in a minute and come back. Once again I had entered the dangerous game of being on hold. At one point I considered hanging up but I decided to persist. After 20 minutes of checking my account she came back to say she could not amend this order and has no idea why it went wrong. The solution is to cancel the order which will take two days and then on Saturday when she is back in office she will try to re-submit the order. I had no option so  have to trust that she will do that.In the meantime I am left with an incredible amount of stress - I still do not know what will happen and I am disgusted with the treatment I have received. I am still shaking and crying - I am as helpless in this situation as useless are your employees. I am now actually considering becoming a BT employee only to be able to fix my issue.  I didn't know where to start and I do not know where to end. I guess I will just say again how extremely disappointed I am especially being a customer for some time. I am hopeful that one day my contract will be cancelled successfully and I will never have to interact with you ever again.

Worst experience with any company I think I’ve ever endured and I rarely complain about anything.  I booked  in to connect to a new property as I was moving  did this well in advance and was set with a connection date.  Was asked to stay in between 8-1 on this date.  So I stayed in and no one came between 8-1.  Called half hour later to be told by engineer he was stuck on a job and it would be given to another engineer.  In contact with BT on and off but not getting any definites.  Original engineer turned up a couple of hours later and did something to the socket in the flat then went out to the box on the street.  A couple of hours later come back in saying fault on line and while most of this sorted out  they needed access to a communal cupboard which I didn’t have access to so an appointment would be arranged.  Heard nothing back again the next day so contacted and was told nothing had been arranged.  They made arrangements while I was on phone to come back and told me explicitly that I didn’t need to be in  that they needed access to communal cupboard and this would be sorted by them.  Come home to find a missed appointment card (I didn’t have a missed appointment) and called and was told I’d have active services by midnight. I tried explaining situation to be told that the line would be active and not to worry.  The line was not active the next day.  Called back and was told that an engineer needed access to the communal cupboard  I explained the situation (again) and so a date was set for a week despite me explaining my autistic son was staying for weekend and the issues this would cause.  The advisor did send me money to pay for a mi-fi device but the data on this was eaten within a night.    Today was the date the engineer was sorting out whatever needed sorting in the communal cupboard.  Had a number of missed calls (I was in training) and when I called back engineer said he couldn’t access my flat.  I explained (yet again) that I was not asked to be in the flat  that they just needed access to the cupboard to be told that there wasn’t an issue with anything in the cupboard  the fault was within the flat (that the first engineer had come in and apparently sorted).  He said to call BT and rearrange another appointment.  I contacted BT and while helpful and friendly  the customer service advisor told me they openreach had me down as missed appointments and as such the next appointment they would be able to set was for the 27th (it’s the 11th today).  Despite my protests  explaining that none of this was my fault  she was unable to do anything about it.   The issue has been poor communication all the way through  and to be told I’m being noted as at fault when I’ve been told I don’t need to be at the flat for the appointment is just plain ridiculous.   As I think someone else said  one star is still way to high a rating for a shambolic experience - the only positives I can think of is that the customer advisors have been friendly enough but being friendly hasn’t got my service running.~~~,Plymouth~~~,2017-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Oh  boy  where to begin. One starring everything would be too much of a compliment. This company is a disaster  and cannot adhere to their own packages and promises. I have had nothing but issues with BT internet since I first achieved it. Packet loss  frequent disconnections  unexplainable cut outs throughout the whole neighbourhood. Sky seems to be the only internet near me which remains up when all others go down. I and other family members have rung up countless of BT support members  who ask us questions relating to the cloud coverage in the sky  wind speed and the atmosphere. They usually go on to say it is the clouds (even if there are barley any in the sky) or due to atmospheric pressure  then put the phone down apologising. Not a single inch of effort is provided during these phone calls  and the tone of their voice is depressing. For the people who we have had around  they do some tests  and at best have replaced our router to no avail. They get paid more than a practitioner and an NHS worker  for being incompetent  useless and sometimes even unresponsive. Any muppet can walk into a house  check a routers lights  then walk back out  where's the professionalism? There isn't any. Do not join this company with any packages that they offer  they are greedy liars and promise lies. They are unreliable and there are plenty of other companies whom offer a better deal in terms of speed and money.~~~,Burgess Hill~~~,2017-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1

Just don't even bother with BT. The shameful state of play is that BT have the monopoly and no matter what company you use (other then Virgin) BT will be charging their lines out and earning money from it. Basically this means they can provide you the lowest level of service and a product that is completely unfit for purpose and still charge hand over fist for it.

VERY UNHELPFUL AND RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Avoid using BT for Broadband.Had BT Broadband 6 Months it's been down for 3 times for a week at a time. Been told that no compensation will be given for the first 2 days each time it's been down as the engineers are allowed 2 days to resolve any issues.After that it's just over one pound per day that I have been offered. I was told I could get 50+MBs but can only get around 10Mbs when it's working which is not very often. It went down again this week. I called to inform them that it's going very slow and dropping out and was told that it's not down the speed you are getting 0.14Mbs means that you still have Broadband service  so we are not going to do anything!!. After 3 calls I was finally put through to complaints I said I have paperwork that says I can get 50Mbs. The call adviser said I have just tested your line and you can get 1Mb which is all that we guarantee!!.You have too many devices connected ( I only had 1 Laptop) I said that's not the speed the paperwork states. Her reply was I will disconnect your broadband I can easily do it. is that want you want me to do? Worst customer service I have ever had and this was from an adviser in the UK!!. Who threatens to leave you with no broadband at all rather than try to help.~~~,Belfast~~~,2017-11-30~~~,1,1,1,1
When first installed my Infinity 2 service was providing 72mb/s  but after 6 months the service fell to 50mb/s  which because it counts as being within BT limits  they are not interested in fixing. After an area power cut  the service was restored to 72mb/s for a couple of weeks  confirming that the performance loss is due to interference  rather than an outright technical fault.~~~,Hinxton~~~,2017-11-28~~~,4,3,3,4

"Fine when everything is working as it should..... BUT when there's a problem you're screwed. If are lucky enough to actually speak to someone on the phone (their ""chat"" service is useless) you'd be lucky if they actually listen to you before pretending to put you through to another department only to end the call. The customer care centre is obviously based in India and  although they speak far better English than I do their language  there are issues lost in translation here also. I have tried over 2 days to report a serious data protection breach where I recieved lots of sensotive data belonging to a third party and have got absolutely nowhere.  The only advice I was given was to ""change my password"" which is obviously nothing to do with the issues I was reporting.~~~",Manchester ~~~,2017-11-28~~~,2,1,3,4
NEVER JOIN BT!!!  0 Star Service!  I have been with BT for a few years now and the WiFi always worked fine until about a year ago.. the WiFi started being really slow but took no notice of it until 2 months ago when I had to reset my hub every day for it to work. In the past 2 months I have been on the phone to BT about 30 times. They have run checks on the hub over the phone  said they’ve fixed it from there end. It then worked for about 2 days and completely stopped working again. Then called again  they decided to send us a new cable because apparently that would help the problem  did not help the problem at all. Then of course  call AGAIN.. They finally sent an engineer out  they gave us a new hub but said there is a problem with the line outside and that another engineer will come out to fix that later on the same day... Guess what  no engineer turned up. I called BT again  they re-arranged another engineer to come the following day... no one turned up Phoned yet again  they said an engineer is coming ‘tomorrow’ the engineer finally turned up to ‘fix the outside line’. The WiFi didn’t work until 2 days after  I had so much hope thinking the problem would be fixed. After all of this our WiFi worked fine for 3 days  on the 4th day it was back down again. Whenever I’ve been on the phone to people they’re useless  they don’t even offer a discount on your bill considering your paying each month and revieving NO WIFI at all!!! They are a joke and they don’t take you seriously at all!!~~~,Essex~~~,2017-11-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I have a BT contract that runs until January 2018 for which my partner and I pay by DD monthly. Having just moved house we decided to go with a more competitive supplier but accepted we would have to pay up our contract for the 12 months. BT quite rightly have charged us for the final month of our contract but what I find astonishing and quite frankly disgusting is they have further charged me £65 for outstanding equipment! I have offered to return the equipment but the rather abrupt lady stated that could not use it again so I questioned why we were being charged £65 when we were in fact paying up for the 12 month contract to which she replied it was because we left early! I find it absolutely disgusting that we are being charged twice especially when they don’t want the equipment back! I would not recommend BT after this and I certainly will never use them again.~~~,Kent~~~,2017-11-27~~~,1,1,2,4
Our internet hasn't been working for two weeks  but we've been told we're impatient and do not have a valid reason to be unhappy or make a complaint. This is the second time our internet has stopped working for two weeks since July when we took out the service.  We've been shouted at down the phone my the customer service manager  Arnab and his team and told we've not given them enough time to sort out internet in the TWO WEEKS they've had. We've been hung up on several times  had our calls dropped and experienced the worst customer service ever.  Cannot believe they're trying to charge us £150 to terminate a contract we are paying for but not receiving.~~~,Oxfordshire~~~,2017-11-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I upgraded my WiFi to the fibre On Thursday and I’ve still no internet been on the phone constant complaining not getting anywhere as I’m determined I’m not paying for engineer to come out And the last phone call was a younger man and he  was helpful as he said it takes 10 days to connect .As I said why didn’t the other advisors tell me this plus the one that sold me the contract As  some of rather advisors are Down right and incompetent and catty And I’ve been a bit customer for 36 years So we will see if it connects in the 10 days will be leaving but when this contract up So  I wouldn’t recommend them  or use them~~~,Glasgow~~~,2017-11-26~~~,1,1,1,1
DO NOT JOIN BT. I moved to BT purely based on price  about a £2 differential to Virgin media. I regret this. It took over a month to get connected to the internet; with no good reason for the delay provided. I then had to move house about 6months into the contract. At the new house the internet still was not connected  it took over a month AGAIN to get connected. I then got charged £130 for the pleasure of being connected because the landline wasn't connected to the exchange.  In terms of the actual service its average at best. The hub is not that powerful (despite what the adverts show) I live in a fairly standard 4 bed house and required a booster for the router to reach the upstairs bedrooms. The BT TV functionality is not as good as Virgin media. Despite series linking my favourite TV shows its hit and miss whether it records them. In summary BT provide poor customer experience  it takes an age to get connected  the home Hub and TV services are basic and worst of all they place additional extortionate charges for getting connected.~~~,West Midlands~~~,2017-11-25~~~,1,1,1,1

I have been with BT for a number of years now and although the actual service is ok  the customer service is shocking. When it’s all working well it’s great. But when it’s not and you’re forced to call them  then you get passed from pillar to post and the fault or issue is seldom sorted. Common phrase of theirs is “the system won’t let me” So annoying. Also  the packages for existing customers is poor. You may as well cancel and come back as a new customer for any sort of deal.~~~,Creed~~~,2017-11-23~~~,1,1,1,3
"Absolutely dismal internet  just this side of the old dial-up.

We upgraded to super fast fibre broadband in June. Since then the service we receive is poorer. I have had engineers out  given advice over the phone  been talked through changes to the settings and it has not improved. BT informed me that the figures they quote are for hard wired devices not wireless. They eventually stated that they could not improve the service. So I a  now paying more for a poorer service than I had originally. I was now out of the cooling off period and would be charged £200 to leave the contract. This is not viable. I am now a very unhappy BT customer until June next year when the contract runs out. They offered me a discount on a new 12 month contract which I refused. I will never use BT again and would advise everyone to avoid them like the plague.~~~,Ayrshire ~~~,2017-11-22~~~,1,2,1,3
