I took 2 years feature line contract  but operator put 5 years. after 2 years when I wanted to cancel i was told I am in 5 year contract. so I made them to listen to the conversation and they accepted that Indeed I agreed with a two year contract therefore there will not be any cancellation charges after September 9.  Now they sent me a bill of £507 for early termination. so far I spent 3 Hours on the phone with 0845 number with no resolution. BT is a CRAP company DO NOT USE THEM even if you are desperate. My Advise is read the fine prints  take your time  have a written proofs  print a copy and save it.~~~,Worcester B975XJ~~~,2016-10-26~~~,1,1,2,3
BT  When joining with them a fluent English speaker and understander  dealt with all the options. An initial thumbs up there BT. When we moved in  they were unable to provide the services on the day agreed  then when I called the helpline  it felt as if I was teaching an English language class via phone. It took them an extra 2 days on top of the month in advance to get my services up and running. But this could only be done with my telephone box dangling from my living room wall by the wires. I then find that SKY is a hell of a lot cheaper with more for your money. Then to add insult to injury  BT then hit me with a £31 disconnection fee. They say that it is a cessation fee  but I have to pay it if I wish to disconnect from BT. This was not spoken about when I went through the cancelling of the service. BT  such a waste of my time and money and causing excessive stress at the beginning and end of our time with them. Cheers~~~,South wales~~~,2016-10-26~~~,2,1,2,2
I can only agree with all of the criticisms of the total service offered by BT. Unresponsive call centres  poor substandard infrastructure  unsophisticated equipment  poor selection of television channels and worst of all a broadband service which is an embarassment. Slow clunky - download speeds of a snail. Glad to have moved away to another supplier and would recommend potential new customers to have nothing to do with this poor company.  The are only hanging on because of their BT sport package  the rest of the service is substandard and a joke (but not a joke if you have a contract with them).~~~,Redhill~~~,2016-10-25~~~,1,1,1,1
I can see that there are ALOT of bad reviews for BT broadband and I pity you folks  however mine is a good one!Set up quick  efficient - after an initial hiccup with the engineer (I called the BT help desk and they sorted it quickly)everything went well.I think a lot of the bad reviews on here are from heavy users with multi gadgets but if you are light user (occasional browsing  shopping  banking and the odd download) then I would recommend BT's ASDL broadband service. I have just finished my 12 month contract  called them up and asked what they could offer me - I now have unlimited weekend calls on the landline (which I didn't have before) as well as unlimited broadband usage which will come in handy. I use the internet on my laptop and mobile. I now pay 26.99 per month including line rental - with no delay in cross over. It is for 24 months though and If I cancel it for any reason before the 24 months is up I do have to pay for the remaining months that I am contracted to (hey ho).Despite that  if you are similar user to me then I would recommend giving them a call to see what they can offer you.Yes my internet is S L O W (get used to the buffer ring if you want to watch videos! but for my usage it is fine (2-3 Gb per month)~~~,Worcestershire~~~,2016-10-25~~~,4,5,3,4
The customer service from bt is some of the worst i have ever come across  tbeir phone manner was shocking when you could actually get through. They make it practically impossable to find a number to call and when you do find it get ready for a 30 minute wait~~~,Lancashire~~~,2016-10-25~~~,1,1,2,3
I changed to BT from Sky because of cost basically.  The the package for the TV and broadband looked good on paper and I thought BT were a good reliable company. HOW WRONG I WAS! For installation I've had four different dates  only for the engineer to come out and fit the hardware on the original date I was given when I placed my order. I'm still getting text messages and emails saying that the engineer is still coming on the other dates as well to fit the hardware when the work has already been done! Also I'm being told that these appointments can not be cancelled and I need to be in my property when the engineer comes to let him in and see the work has already been done. Madness!!! After all of this I'm still waiting for my TV and broadband to be activated. When I call BT I cannot get a suitable answer and they seem clueless. The whole thing has been a joke from beginning to end. Terrible service. I WISH I'D STAYED WITH SKY!!!!~~~,Newcastle~~~,2016-10-25~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Never even got to use the service. They took 5 days to tell me they could in fact not provide the service  and in the interim had taken money out of my account. I've been told I'll be refunded that amount twice and still no refund after a month. Staff are obnoxious and extremely unhelpful. Overall shocking.~~~,~~~,2016-10-24~~~,1,1,1,1
BRITISH TELECOM has the worst customer service I have ever experienced.  The worst broadband reliability I have ever encountered. Do not choose this supplier. Four engineer visits and many many calls to customer service still result in my using a dongle to get internet access. RUBBISH~~~,Chichester~~~,2016-10-24~~~,1,1,3,1
Hands down the worst  most incompetent  slippery company I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.  Useless.  They don't do what they say they will do and then flat out lie to you when you try to resolve the issues.  Not only are they charging me for services that are not working  they are charging me for calls from my land line phone which does not even exist.

I have been waiting over a week for BT to get my broadband up and running. I have called them 3 times and  first of all they managed to get the landline working but not the broadband.The next two times the Indian call centre people told me to wait until midnight and each time there was no difference by the next morning.Finally  I called to cancel and they asked me to give them from Saturday until Monday to get BT Open Reach to fix things (do I care whose fault it is?).It didn't work so I have cancelled the contract.I would have stayed with Virgin if they also operated in the area I have moved to.~~~,Bedford~~~,2016-10-24~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~

Help line is useless. Their desktop help said Home Hub defective but they would not replace it. I got a router from elsewhere and now Broadband work. Leaving BT and they try scare tactics to try and make you stay threatening £200 fee tat they are not entitled to. Bring it down to £70 by 'phone  but will text  E-Mail and send a letter for £200.33 but will not send anything saying £70. Awful company and I want nothing to do with them. NOT recommended.BB advertised at about 76mb  I got 34.5 that with Infinity 2!~~~,Kent~~~,2016-10-22~~~,1,1,1,4
Having a really bad time with bt at the moment. My bills were £70 a month never use the house phone was on unlimited wifi also caller Id and answer phone. So asked why bill so much she said I hardly use data so go onto 25gb a month as was only using average of 5gb well said ok so new contract what a surprise after the 14 days I gets email you have reached your data allowance that was 15 days. So i rung they said must be us so the next month first day we were away and amazing we used 11gb no one home but still must be us I have been trying to sort this now since mid September I want to leave but must pay them £350. Disgusting.~~~,Yorkshire~~~,2016-10-22~~~,1,1,3,4

"Where to start.. BT Customer service.. SHOCKINGLY BAD!Got my broadband installed on 30th september! From day one! Nothing but problems. Random disconnects.. slow speeds unless i suspect use there BT speed tested.They sent an engineer with the standard threat of £130 charge if they found no fault.. engineer arrived  to find it WAS NOT WORKING and left with ""NO IDEA WHY"". 5 days later they sent another engineer who found the fault to be a port with the openreach exchange.. but get this.. Because i threatened to leave BT. Openreach told him he was not allowed to change the port i was on! Luckily this was all within my cooling of period.. so i told them to get lost! Honestly the worst company i have ever used! Not saying that Virgin are any better (The only real alternative) but at least engineer visits are not charged & the connection tends to be stable!~~~",Leicesteshire~~~,2016-10-22~~~,1,1,2,1

I have been without BT broadband for three days and there is no end in sight for when it will be restored. There has been no communication from BT. Only digital options on the phone. No human being. I gave my mobile number for them to send a text when it is up and running. They have not used it to apologise or explain the situation. We should receive a refund and compensation. At the very least they should send out a letter to those affected. The customer service is absolutely appalling which adds insult to the inconvenience.~~~,Uxbridge~~~,2016-10-21~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Worst customer experience ever with BT. Broadband was due to be activated 2 days ago and still waiting. Spent over 5 hours trying to resolve over last 3 days and just been told will not be connected until 26th October - 8 days late! Appalling service  and manager put down phone when I complained. BTCare on Twitter just refer back to online agents so you go round in circles. Wish I had never considered BT and looking at how I can cancel my contract.~~~,Bedford~~~,2016-10-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst customer service I have experienced. We have been without internet for nearly 3 weeks now because they are incapable of getting our broadband right. All we have done is move house (4 doors)  we didn't even want a new router we were happy with the one we had  but BT told us we would be upgraded to Infinity. The customer service team are shocking. We have made various phone calls and web chats  have been pushed from Pillar to post getting nowhere. Our phone bills are huge due to data use from not having no wifi. A manager/ someone in charge was meant to call  we were told it was going to take 2 days for them to call back and we are still waiting for that phone call. Will never be using them again!!~~~,Manchester~~~,2016-10-20~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is THE worst broadband and wifi provider. We were without broadband and wifi for 3 and a half weeks and were on the phone to be for hours because we couldn't get through and we'd be put on hold for up to 2 hours every time. BT would happily quickly get in touch when they hadn't received payment even though we hadn't got anything received any broadband or wifi within this time. It has been the WORST customer service my family has ever received. I would not recommend BT to anyone  100% going back to sky we had no problems with them.~~~,Coventry~~~,2016-10-20~~~,1,1,1,1
put a order in 4 1/2 weeks ago they came the first time on time although we could not find where the wires entered the building fair enough this wasn't either ours or their fault. We got in contact with the landlord of the property to find out where and got that sorted so WE rand back a few days later I say we as BT did not get in touch after Outreach couldn't do the job. I rang and they said I had the wrong address apparently I should be living in the Isle of wight not the midlands. got put through to the manager who said he had sorted it out he put records straight and made another appointment with Outreach to come out the following Monday when we had arranged to have the key from the landlord. They came out the Friday before when no one was at there my son was in lectures at Uni this is his flat he is in his last year and needs the internet for his dissitation. The engineer rang me and I told him I we had been told he would be there on Monday and we had arranged for the key to wires to be there on that date. Monday came no engineer so we rang BT they rang outreach no appointment had been made for that date  or so they say. They made another date for the following Wednesday morning. Wednesday morning came and went no engineer so We rang again they rang outreach apparently the engineer was running late. but my son had to do some shopping which I said I would do he also had to go to a meeting with university Officer training corps UOTC at 4pm he was fuming and quite rightly so. anyway I pick up his shopping and go over to take over from him. There is an Outreach van there I speak to the engineer he was working at a neighbour Id just missed our engineer I should ring BT and  they can ring the office to get him back my son was in the building he had the key i can't get in without it. I go into the flat and ring Bt the woman refused to ring outreach as I did not have my account number but my identity could have been easily prooved once the call had been made also their are other security questions the could have asked which were set up on making the order. She put the phone down on me when I asked for the manager  the one who supposedly made an appointment for the previous Monday. I rang My other son turned up also at University with his phone so I asked him to get up my Emails to get my account number and I rang them again they asked my name I told them they told me they had no account in that name so I told them my account number they said that was a false account number all their account numbers begin with GT and not BT which is what my a Email said it was. he then listened to my story and I asked him if he could ring outreach he told me he didn't deal with broadband only broken land lines yet it was the same number i'd rang before all this took an hour on the phone he said he would get me transferred to someone who could help  but he was busy so it couldnt do it for 1/2 hour there is about 5 min wait for me to ring. So he said he would ring back I said with 5 mins he said 10mins so I waited someone rang who was prepared to ring Outreach to ask why he had not rung the bell she asked for my name the address twice telephone number and my account number which suddenly was the correct one and my security question by this time My son had missed his important meeting with the UTOC he will now be in trouble. by this time of course it was a whole 2hrs later and getting dark of course the engineer wasn't going to come back.  I felt like the whole of the customer service was having some kind of sick joke with me. I am sure this not the first time this has happened.

"DO NOT GO WITH BT.  Activation supposed to happen on 14/10/2016 and still nothing on 19/10/2016 with no answers.  Indian customer service lines  on hold for at least 30+ minutes a time  no answers or explanations  always fobbed off with ""we'll investigate and call you back"" but never receive said call-back.  Can hardly believe that the company has not shut down  operating the way that it is.  Would never recommend and will be cancelling contract.  Can't comment on broadband quality  as we never actually received any.~~~",Bristol~~~,2016-10-19~~~,1,1,1,1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS Choose BT if you like to spend hours waiting to speaking to customer support for a service that does not work. It has been 6 days since my BT hub arrived. It didn't work  and after all of the manual trouble-shooting I called up BT customer support. In total  the communication took 3 and a half hours. Their option was to send an engineer. After questioning  this would set me back £130  despite the £55 I had already spent on delivery and set-up of the hub. The engineer would take 2 days to arrive  does NOT do evenings or weekends - meaning me working from home with no internet.... The next day I receive a call  they've looked into the problem  and think it's due to external wiring. They will send an engineer externally  and text me with the result. 3 days later  I have received no text so call them up. Their solution (with no explanation for what the engineer) was to send a new hub  The new hub does not work again. Their solution -  to send an engineer again (costing me £130). When can he arrive - FIVE WORKING DAYS TIME. I say I want to cancel. It's too late in the evening for me to cancel. I make a request for somebody to phone me the next morning. Nobody phones. I call them... twenty minutes later  I am still on the phone.~~~,wimbledon~~~,2016-10-19~~~,1,1,1,1

"This is the worst ever ISP (internet service provide) that I have had since 2003. Worst ever customer service. Worst ever order management. Worst ever technical execution. Worst ever liars when it comes to explanations why they did not do what they had promised to do. Worst ever incompetent technical staff when it comes to telephone number managements. Please read on for a substantiation of these statements. Here is My story: I placed an order to BT on the phone on 14/Aug/2016 for a telephone service  broadband  BT TV and BT Sports. The customer adviser promised that I would keep my existing telephone number  that the service would start in 7 to 15 days time and certainly by 30/Aug and that I would not be without a telephone and internet for longer than 4 hours  and at maximum only 24 hours. All these promises turned out to be empty words -- it is now 63 days later and I have been without internet for 35 days (and of course also without BT TV and BT Sports too -- these were never delivered). And to add insult to injury BT have changed my landline telephone number to a new random number -- I had had my old number for 15 years and all my friends and relatives have that number. However  BT despite actually promising to keep my number (they had promised this in writing) changed my landline number without any warning to me or consent on my side. So  after placing the order on 14/Aug  nothing happened till 01/Sept except that BT cancelled my order without any request from me  without any warning to me or even an explanation -- just an e-mail that BT had now canceled the placed order. That's it -- simple and plain. Upon calling them on 01/Sept they explained that they had to canceled the order due to an internal system error in their order management system for which they had to apologize terribly and profoundly and then they promised that they would now recreate the cancelled order and start providing services by 14/Sept. I wanted to speak to BT Complaints department and explain that I had not waited for 17 days in order to be told that BT had done nothing at all for this time and that I needed again to start from zero and wait for another 14 days. However  there is no Complaints Department in BT -- a customer can only call and complain to the BT Order Management Department  which is the same department that mismanaged my order in the first place. As an additional aggravating factor  the BT Order Management Department is located in India and there they do know a trick or two on how to deal with the customers  here is a verifiable list of such tricks (I had other tricks played on me  but I do not remember all of them):    (a) they places you on hold and then quietly hang up;    (b) they say that they will put you through to the ""Customer Options Team""  but all they do is put you to the back of the calls queue to their own department (the BT Order Management Dept) and you simply wait on the line for another 15-25 minutes in order to speak with another adviser from the same department and be asked to explain everything again and again;    (c) they say that they will put you through to talk to a manager  since your case is so serious and urgent  and then they simply leave you on the line to listen to a ringing tone for 20  30  40 mins or until you despair and hang up;    (d) they say that they will need to discuss the matter with someone else  who has the authority to resolve your problems immediately  and they promise to call you back within not more than 60 minutes. Then they hang up and you are left waiting in vain for 60  120  180 minutes for them to call back  but they never call back  not even 2  3  4  6 days later.    (e) they tell you that they have recorded your complaint and that a manager will call you after 7 days to discuss the complaint -- they set a date and even tell you between which times the manager would call. Only  no manager calls on that date  nor on the following day nor in the following 3 days. Upon calling them again and asking them why no one called they explain that they have no record of this complaint or of the agreed callback  but that they will now log this second complaint and a manager will call you in another 7 days time -- they set the date and tell you the times... you know the story by now: no one calls back on this second time too  not on the third time in another 7 days  not on the fourth time in yet another 7 days (this will now be 7 x 4 = 28 days later). By 15/Sept nothing happened except that BT changed my landline number to a new random number (despite having told me in writing that they would keep it). Upon calling them on 16/Sept and asking for an explanation they told me that this was due to a system error in their BT Openreach exchange and they apologized terribly and profoundly for this and they promised to correct the error in three days time by 18/Sept. On 18/Sept BT changed my landline number to a another new random number but did not give me back my old number (which I had had for 15 years). Upon calling them they apologized terribly and profoundly  told me that this time they would correct the problem in three days time by 21/Sept. They also explained that my old number had not been restored because the first customer adviser did not know and did not follow the correct procedure for requesting the restoration of the number  but that this time they knew the procedure and they would follow it faithfully. Three days later  on 21/Sept BT gave me yet a third random number but not my old number. When I called them they apologized terribly and profoundly and told me that they would correct the problem in another three days time by 24/Sept. They also explained that the second customer adviser did not know and did not follow the correct procedure for requesting the restoration of my number  but that on this third time they knew the procedure and they would follow it faithfully. Another three days later on 24/Sept BT gave me yet another new random number but did not restore my old number. I called them again and they again apologized terribly and profoundly and promised... well  by now you know the story -- it was repeated no less than three more times before BT at long last managed to restore my old number (which I had had for 15 years and which they had changed without my consent). Long story short  today is 18/Oct/2016 and I still do not have any internet  neither BT TV nor BT Sports. They are now promising that they would start providing services soon. Should I believe them? I should I call and tell them that I want to leave BT on grounds that for 63 days BT managed only to change my landline number to several random numbers but have not managed to start delivering internet? Having written this account of my woes (and now that I finally got back my old phone number) I think that I will go and check Virgin Media prices and give BT the ""end-of-line"".~~~",Bristol~~~,2016-10-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Do not buy the SMARThub. The internet continuously drops out. BT do not care though they know about the design flaw. There is just a lot of faffing around on the phone that goes nowhere.

Worst service i have ever known  been with BT only 3 weeks and had nothing but trouble  ive had to contact them almost every night to sort out a problem with my broadband as it keeps disconnecting when it feels like it and the speed keeps dropping  whenever i ring them im on hold for over an hour then to be put through to people that dont know what they are doing  they just like to keep you on hold for call time  anyone considering BT please STAY AWAY im taking my custom elsewhere!!~~~,Walsall~~~,2016-10-18~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
In terms of the speed and reliability things are great. The problems with BT start at installation - They made a real mess of my property when installing. It then took hours of chasing to receive the incentives they advertised as part of the broadband offer (vouchers etc). Things then get worse if you ever need to call them to adjust anything in relation to your service. Their online customer service is appalling. After months of terrible service i decided to let my 12 month contract end without renewal  only to be charged £31 for the privilege of not renewing. Really would suggest avoiding BT even they have the lowest price in your area.~~~,Notts~~~,2016-10-18~~~,1,1,5,5

Tried to get on bt sports to watch a game but couldn't log on. Their technical advisor got me to try logging on several times over the phone. He then advised me I was locked out for 24hrs because I had (on his advice) tried too many times! They flatly refused to do anything more to assist me. I have since tried to leave BT but they are telling me I renewed my contract 4 weeks ago?!?!? and there would be large termination fees. This didn't happen  they are not forthcoming with any proof that it did but are refusing to let me leave. Customer service terrible stay well away~~~,lincolnshire~~~,2016-10-18~~~,1,1,3,3
