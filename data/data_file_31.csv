Awful service  awful internet speed and reliability and usual response from customer service! And to think we now pay more than what we use to with Sky  for a far worse service! If you think the grass is greener on the otherside....ITS NOT!!~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-07-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Poor customer service. Had to speak to 7 people before anyone could help. Very little information provided when asked how the hub will be connected. Ended up with Hub in the room. To move it will cost £130. Cooling off period starts from contract not from the time hub is received. Provision of goods is part of service so it should be from date HUB received. Very poor service. Not to recommended.~~~,Norbury~~~,2017-07-06~~~,2,2,3,3

"SHOCKING service. Placed order  got told it will arrive June 8th. On the 8th I looked online to see my order had been canceled - normal or correspondence to say this. I call and they said ""there is no fibre cable or infinity in your area"". So i had to place another order for regular broadband. This arrives 10 days later - does not work. Call and they test line  they book an engineer. Engineer comes and says BT should have noticed there were two lines to this property  and haven't. I said I wanted infinity package but could as there was no fibre in the area - he took me outside to show me the fibre cable and my neighbour came out and I asked them what they had - Infinity BT package. Its not just that but the internet is rubbish. I use my neighbours SKY internet mosts nights as it is better and stronger - our houses aren't even attached. I made a complaint and had to follow up and chase it a million times. Each time I got someone new in another country who hadn't read my file and so on. I even at one point asked ""can i have my account number as i have not received any paperwork""  the woman said ""yes if you give me your account number I can access your account and get you your information"". Truly shocking service and contradicting all the time. When i complained and wanted to cancel they were going to charge me for cancelling the service. Wont even get into the rest of it as there is a novel full of stuff that has happened last 8 weeks. I have been shocked and BT are certainly not the leaders in the market or if they are we should worry. I wish i had gone with SKY again.~~~",Morpeth~~~,2017-07-04~~~,1,1,1,1

BT has a long way to go to get customer service. Wi-Fi is rubbish does not work ring them up and tell them they say there's nothing wrong sending engineer out that's another expense to you to have a day off work when is BT going to get everything right I think I'm getting fed up getting on the phone to BT and all they say nothing wrong and you get call centres in India . will thay bring their call centres back to UK what a waste of time BT should be 0 not 1 star if I could give you 0  stars I would~~~,Ss94nq~~~,2017-07-03~~~,1,1,3,1
Internet was very slow and now I don't have any at all. It's been going on for 5 days. So far I have called them 4 times each time having a conversation for altleast an h. Every time we are on a phone they are looking for a fault and eventually says that they will book in someone to come in and fix it. Today we haven't had internet for 5 days now and this morning they let me know that they haven't booked anyone yet but if i want to they can find someone for Tuesday. Wich means that 3 more days we I will have no internet. This company is a nightmare and the way they operate is unacceptable. Slowest customer service ever. I'm very disappointed and I will change provider if I am not satisfied with the response I receive.~~~,LONDON~~~,2017-07-02~~~,1,1,1,1
The only thing worse than BT broadband is their customer service.The internet barely goes a day without failing  often dropping out every 5-10 minutes. Even with the best package it struggles to have more than two devices connected to it and using it at the same time. I have ended up having to increase my mobile data allowances twice purely due to the unreliable BT broadband. The only good thing about BT is the open zone.~~~,Newcastle~~~,2017-07-01~~~,1,1,2,1
Constant disconnections  apparently asking for a reliable broadband service is asking for too much these days! BT and Virgin Media have been absolute nightmares .~~~,London~~~,2017-06-30~~~,1,1,3,1
utterly awful to be brutal  way overcharged  say you will get 50mb but only receive 20.~~~,axlknxln~~~,2017-06-29~~~,1,2,1,1
I would rather pay double than use BT ever again. They seem incapable of fixing a problem without you having to spend hours on the phone. 31 days and counting to fix a premium mail issue.~~~,Daventry~~~,2017-06-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Customer service is PANTS! Products are ok but if you have an issue you are in for hours of painful phone calls.~~~,Daventry~~~,2017-06-29~~~,1,1,2,2
bt were very good but the last few months have been a nightmare they are over subscribed but will not admitt it~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-06-29~~~,1,3,1,1
We had bt in 2014 it would not function properly from the day it was installed we persevered for two months constantly trying to contact BT's ignorant call centres that would say it's a line problem  let's try re starting your hub  we have an engineer working on it in your area. They actually refused to send out an engineer to our house despite numerous calls. In the end we were fed up and told them that their services were not fit for purpose to which they told us we could cancel the contract. The next thing we know is almost two years later out of the blue bt send us a bill for a years contract because we cancelled it. Went to the ombudsman and they were useless after investigating the matter for three months they told us that bt have to apologise for the time lapse without contacting us but that we will still have to pay the bill. Bt did not issue the apology to us but the ombudsman sent us a copy of the one that was apparently issued to them. Bt are a faceless  rip off  nightmare that will mess you around all day long especially once they have your money. They just want your money and once they have got it they couldn't give a monkeys.~~~,Hants~~~,2017-06-28~~~,1,1,1,1
I have no issues with my current BT set up it works fine. I am however changing my ISP because BT cannot solve issues(well my issue) without you having to to be called  or you call them  over 30 times and counting  to fix something. They lie I have been told my issue is fixed 4 times. It has not been. I have never spoken to the same person in customer non service team. They lie. They created a false account to supposedly fix my issue which they assured me would be deleted and then started to charge me for it. Oh! and they can't cancel it straight away for some unknown reason. Some of there customer non service team are polite but most are rude and don't listen to you. They call you back at the wrong times. They cut you off. They put you on hold for 10 minutes. You try their live chat and they fix the problem. Yeah! Oh! maybe not. They lie to you saying your problem is fixed as it is still there the next day. Have I mentioned that they lie. They say your issue is now solved can we close the complaint. You say yes thanks for solving my problem. The next day the issue is still there. Never ever close a complaint until you are sure it is done otherwise you start all over again. In the last couple of months I have spoken to BT more than my friends and family and my issue is not resolved. If you enjoy pain in your life then sign up for BT broadband. If I could give 0 marks I would. When my switch is complete I am going to smash all there equipment up and post it to them. Oh! and because it was a nightmare joining BT. I have 4 sets of stuff. They messed up my order so badly  they kept cancelling it and doing another order so I ended up with 4 sets! BT are incompetent idiots. I feel much better after that.~~~,Northants~~~,2017-06-28~~~,1,1,4,4
Ridiculous! I placed a Business order with BT over 2 weeks ago. When I was placing the order and they were agreeing to take my money they were more than happy to tell me that my order will be completed and fitted within 10 working days. So 10 working days went by and nothing  so I rang BT myself to find out what was going on and I was told they were waiting to do a credit check  so why did nobody contact me to do this  I had to ring BT myself to do the credit check  now all of that has been done  here I am again nearly 3 weeks later and I'm still waiting  i am literally on hold to BT while I am writing this review  the order has still not gone through. How ridiculous and disgusting is this that nearly 3 weeks after I placed my order that it still has not even been put through  this is an order for a business line  so the amount of money that is slipping by me because my customers cannot call or email me because I have no internet is ridiculous. I cannot believe that BT can be so unprofessional  especially when it comes to handling their business customers  how can you allow my business to suffer the way that it is and you are doing nothing about it. I cannot believe how ridicules BT have been  it's my own fault for choosing such a company~~~,Birmingham~~~,2017-06-27~~~,1,1,1,1
This is by far the worst company that I have ever dealt with. Customer service pfft... to call this a service is an insult to any service people across the globe. Every time that I have phoned them they have been incredibly rude  dismissive and aggravating. If I could have given zero stars I would have.  Now I don't want to bore you with specifics of my case  so if you aren't interested skip over this paragraph. After BT hiked their prices again (the second time in 12 months) I phoned up to cancel  which they assured me would be free as they had broken their side of the contract. Lo and behold they tried to charge me the cancellation fee (oh sorry our prices are extortionate  please before you go we can offer you the absolute worst deal we have for double the money of our competition. Not interested? Well that'll be £31 for the privilege of taking your business elsewhere). I explained that they had broken contract so I shouldn't be charged  and they said that they had sent the letter out weeks before I had received it. An argument happened  they refused to do anything. Long story short I left BT (paying the fee). Joke's on them though  as a landlord I manage multiple properties  all of which used to be with BT; now none of them are. Was only going to change one house. Estimated loss to BT's business = 16 x 52 x 12 = £9 984 per year. Amount gained in cancellation fees 16 x 31 = £496. Honestly even if they offered me the service for free  I wouldn't go with them. Not worth the hassle.~~~,London~~~,2017-06-23~~~,1,1,3,2
I would give BT 0 stars if possible. They have quite possibly the worst customer service team possible. After refusing to cancel my account they still continued to charge me up to 15 pounds per month for an account I did not want. I am unsure of this is borderline theft however I am appalled at the provided services: an email I cannot access  overly excessive monthly charges for a limited email account  no accessible customer services team able to cancel a simple email account.  DO NOT SIGN UP~~~,UK~~~,2017-06-23~~~,1,1,1,1
I wouldnt recommend BT to anyone as they are very expensive and service is bad. Most companies are like this but to be  honest they win the crown~~~,ha8 9ed~~~,2017-06-23~~~,1,1,1,1
I have had 3 engineers to look at my broadband. The first one said that rats have chewed the cables in the exchange and to fix the problem the road would have to be dug up. BT don't want to know  and their telephone operators are the most ignorant I have ever dealt with. Appalling customer service.~~~,Rhondda Cynon Taff~~~,2017-06-23~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been a BT customer for only a couple of months and I have had the worst customer experience of my life. After signing up for their deal with a usage cap  I was unable to log in to my BT email account because of an error message  which meant I did not receive any emails about my usage. So my bill was £100 for 1 month. After wasting hours of my time on the phone trying to fix my email over 3-4 weeks they have still not fixed the error message. In the meantime I upgraded to infinity and the representative even said to me that it was the end of his shift as an excuse as to why his system was failing to accept my email address format when upgrading! In the end he was laughing at the system because he knew how dumb it is! The residential team even referred me onto the business team to fix the email issue  to which the business team joked back at me saying how dumb the residential team are at referring them on to the wrong team. In the end I have received a total of approximately 10-15 calls from BT some of which took an hour and my BT email is still not working. What a total waste of time! The broadband speed is ok but everything else awful  avoid BT they will leave you feeling angry and annoyed and helpless.~~~,~~~,2017-06-23~~~,~~~,~~~,3,~~~
"A service I would not recommend to anyone in my right mind. Really early on we started having connectivity issues; the wi-fi would appear to be connected although there was no internet there. We have since started contacting BT. A nightmare to get to talk to someone but I guess that you would expect from a large company and it would be OK if you get a solution to the problem. However  the people in customer service although very polite they have been unable to identify the problem and provide a solution to. It has always been ""turn your modem off  turn it on again  oh it is working now!"". Has it been a faulty modem device issue from the very beginning? We will never get to know. The bottom line is that after so many phone- calls  effort to get help and patience no solution has been offered  bearing in mind that I wouldn't mind paying for a repair if someone would check and suggest a specific one. It is a very poor service provided whilst BT keeps increasing their monthly fee. Our connection to the internet is unpredictable  a constant on and off and nowhere to turn to for technical support. Please  do never choose BT!~~~",London~~~,2017-06-23~~~,1,1,3,1
I pay an increased price for fibre which I don't actually receive as I'm too far from the exchange.  I'm still supposed to receive 10-12mb but actually get closer to 6mb on a good day.  I paid for an engineer to move my master socket only for the speed to lower further.  When contacting BT they inform me that any engineer visit is likely to charge me the call out fee again.  Customer service is unbearably tedious and repetitive  to the point where I can no longer be bothered phoning.  I've bought my own 3rd party router which has helped with reliability.~~~,Titchfield~~~,2017-06-22~~~,1,2,1,1

On most expensive fibre package - long term ongoing problems - impossible to contact and report problems (min 30 min wait on phone) resulting in very expensive and unusable service. Avoid like the plague.~~~,Braintree~~~,2017-06-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible broadband speed and customer service. Im tied in until Feb 2018. Are there any get out clauses?~~~,Kilwinning ~~~,2017-06-20~~~,1,2,2,1
Bunch of crooks. Been with BT for more than 10 years and I am paying close to £45/mth for my broadband package for nothing special. They have amazing online offers for NEW customers for half the price for the exact same package yet whenever I call their Customer Options Team to see if they are happy to offer me the same deal as a long-term customer   it is always a NO with no valid reason and best they can do is chop off £6/month. Big whoopee. They are happy to screw over existing customers and I are fed up of their conniving immoral ways and will be looking elsewhere.~~~,London~~~,2017-06-20~~~,1,1,2,2
As a student moving back home to my parents' house after completing my degree I was surprised to find myself charged with a £31 cancellation fee after using BT services for 2 years. My parents already use BT services at their home so I cannot carry the service to my new address and cannot change service providers as I am moving out. I was also asked to pay for the services for a further 30 days despite me not requiring internet after moving out. Last year when I rang BT I was told to ring back within 30 days of moving out to cancel the service  not that I need to give 30 days notice. Very disappointed with the service and  as a student  would rather not pay for internet in a house I am not living in.~~~,Sheffield~~~,2017-06-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst internet ever.Connection loosing while playing fifa. Loosing pointsCalled several times to come to fix it and they didn't. We had an engineer scheduled and he didn't show upVery badThey incresead the rates after a few months~~~,London~~~,2017-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1

After seeing the advertisement with Ryan Reynolds getting wifi signal all over his house I thought BT would be good. They are not and on contacting them I was told that the advert was completely inaccurate. So I can not get access in my entire home. Its a small 3 bed detached.I was told by the engineer to swap to wires in my master hub by removing the front cover. On doing this the insides fell out also.I called bt as that should not happen as there should be clips holding it in. BT said they can fix the box at a cost of £250. This was after hours of trying to talk on the online chat where they pass you from person to person and get you know where. Horrible company and I can't wait to be done with them.~~~,Alfreton ~~~,2017-06-18~~~,1,1,3,1
Recently moved home  and the only provider for my area was BT for fibre optic broadband  so I went with them. Had to wait 3 weeks until the first engineer was to install the outside box. Almost instantly that was delayed by 3 days. Then to my horror on the 2nd engineer & part 2 of the installation the Open Reach engineer told me that BT subcontracted out to a Kelly's engineer who made a complete hash of the job  which included leaving dangerous splines outside my front door. Almost two weeks on from the 2nd engineer company around  I am still awaiting it to be resolved. I'm having to call them to chase it up  as I keep getting told that someone will call back within a certain time period and no one does  all being one person. I have made countless calls  time  and am still being told that someone will call me in 5 days time with an update. How is it that a company of this size can get away with such terrible service  that should be fined.~~~,Higher Davis Farm ~~~,2017-06-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I moved to BT infinity from Talk Talk as I was not happy with the service. What a mistake it has turned out to be!Out of 10 and a half months of the contract BT have only managed to get the minimumum speed for 2 months. The rest of the time it is way bellow the minimum. I have tried phoning and web chats multiple times and no one did anything to improve it. The customer service is useless! Cannot wait to leave.   Avoid at all costs!~~~,Cambridgeshire~~~,2017-06-15~~~,~~~,~~~,2,3
Had absolutely nothing but trouble registering and setting up my account. Repeated calls from bt asking me to go through the same steps as before. Must have spent 7 hours on the phone. Sustained speed and WiFi coverage worse than five year old sky box. Wish I'd stayed with sky. Even had problems with reward card not arriving after being assured it was sent. If I could turn the clock back I'd still be using the superior sky service~~~,Banbury~~~,2017-06-15~~~,1,1,2,3
"The biggest diabolical shambles I've ever experienced in my short 26 years on this planet. I'm not going to dignify them by even giving them a single star. If you are reading this DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE. I've recently just moved house and decided id purchase a TV package. I'd rung round all the companies and BT offered me the best price. It seemed like a no brainer and I signed up straight away. I was told they'd be a one off fee of £89.99 which I paid instantly not thinking anything of it. Then the women on the phone told me they wouldn't be coming to install this and went onto inform me they couldn't guarantee the delivery date and said it'd actually be £49 a month rather than £46. So at this point I asked to speak to a manager and explained id be reserving my right to cancel with immediate effect. I was then informed they would ""trigger a refund"" and that id have it within 7 working days. I assumed that was it  that id never have any dealings with this lot again. I've never been more wrong in my life. This is where the shambles and blatant lies really started. After 7 days no money was in my account  I phoned up and after been put on hold for a ridiculously long amount of time (this would become a very recurring theme). I was then informed it was actually ""within 14 working days"" and that I would receive my money then. Id also like to add the operator was damn right rude and self-righteous. Then after a further 7 days I looked in my account and shock- horror there was refund in there. I called up again  took ages to get through  got put on hold for ages as normal. This time I was informed ""there's been a problem with the system the refund hasn't been triggered"" and that id receive my money back within 14 days. After 14 further days I found again no money was in my account. So again I called up and again I explained the situation. This time I was put on hold for even longer and given the usual line of ""we'll try and find out whats happened"". This time the operator who again couldn't hide the fact she couldn't care less. Informed me that they're were ""no details of me on the the system"". Id been amazingly patient up until the point  so at this stage I told them in no uncertain terms id been stolen off and lied to. She then somehow managed to find details and gave me the party line of ""I've triggered the refund and you'll receive the money within 14 days"". It may shock you to know that after 14 days again it hasn't arrived. It's now been well over a month and as you can guess I called up again to find out why. As usual the operator on the phone was rude and asked me ""not to be angry"" if you can believe it. She then ""did some digging""  put me on hold for a record of 15 minutes. She then told me ""it would be within 10 working days"". I said no Im not having this put me onto a manager immediately. She took a further 8 minutes to manage this. He then spoke to me saying he was very sorry etc  that he'd got all the details of previous calls up on screen. That none of them had triggered my refund properly because the account was closed. I explained to him id been lied to on a few occasions and asked why it was just such a problem to pay me now. On the day I signed up  they had no issues removing the money at all. He just kept apologising before  eventually saying ""he'd send a cheque in the post with a final bill and refund"".. Id argued and argued to no avail. I've lost even more money to them in phone bills but I'm not giving up on it. It's caused a huge amount of stress I really don't need in my life at the moment. Since all this I've signed up to virgin media for just a bit more money per month  who installed everything for free with no one - off fees. However I think I can say RIP to my £89.99.~~~",York~~~,2017-06-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Worst internet provider I've ever had. Internet constantly drops. Had sky before  had problems with their internet. One complaint call and with the push of a button on their end ran smoothly for 5 years straight. BT won't acknowledge issue or let me leave contract. They state that they can send engineer but if no fault will cost me. All that has changed in last 5 years before getting problems is a switch to BT. I just want to get rid of this awful service and go back to Sky.~~~,Coventry~~~,2017-06-14~~~,1,1,4,1
