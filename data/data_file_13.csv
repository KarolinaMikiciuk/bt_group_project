Several weeks ago I reported problems with my router  far from the three days as promised on the adverts  I am still waiting. Every time I speak to BT customer service they assure me that they have placed an order for one to be sent  each time I check my order History and nothing has been sent. My complaint has been escalated to the highest level and was given final assurances that my new router has been sent  but the same thing has happened again. Please avoid BT at all costs.~~~,Bristol~~~,2018-12-18~~~,1,1,3,2
"Avoid avoid avoid. Can't believe how disappointed I am. Ordered the service on 29/11. Was supposed to be active 6/12. Nothing happened and I called the customer service. They said the engineer made a mistake and it will be activated 11/12. Nothing happened. Called the customer service and they said the engineer is rescheduled for 16/11. Northing happened. Same stuff happened again and the next ""activation date"" is 19/11. Bt has one job and that is to turn my broadband on. They have failed to do that simple task for 3 weeks now. I would never recommend anyone to change their service to BT.~~~",London~~~,2018-12-18~~~,1,2,1,1
Unbelievable. Broadband speed is awful. BT don’t guarantee speed of WiFi in my house only wired connection. BT TV hasn’t been working for 3 months. They will only send out an engineer only if I agree to pay £85 if the fault is in my house? Don’t trust them! Poor poor service!! I was with Sky for 10 years. Not one problem. No one.~~~,Epsom Surrey ~~~,2018-12-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Not recommended customer service non existent  service not fir for purpose. Happy to take 43.00 per month and offer a new package  for no internet~~~,Juniper hill~~~,2018-12-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Do not use this service. I have been locked in a contract for 24 months now and cant wait to leave. Monthly prices have been upped 4 or 5 times during this time and I now pay almost £50 for a broadband only service. Never again~~~,Chippenham ~~~,2018-12-15~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
The worst service I have ever been in contact with. Booked an installation  took a day off work and no-one turned up. BT told me the engineer came at 3.30pm but I was waiting all day  so basically a lie. I re-booked for another day and called BT twice to make sure they would come  they told me on both occasions that someone would definitely attend this afternoon. Called them a third time and BT said that the appointment was changed for the next day  without bloody telling me. I cancelled straight away  I am not paying some muggy company my hard earned cash even and this is even before the initial installations.~~~,London~~~,2018-12-12~~~,1,1,1,~~~
LN12DF  Paid for 60mb-80mb Broadband but actually receiving constant 29.3-29.5mb  and there has been no Dial Tone since Friday on landline!. This is paid for BT Broadband Super Fast Fibre II: and this a breach of contract since Friday 07/12/2018.  Hope anyone working for the Telecom Regulators  Ofcom read this. Now on telephone line:  0800 800 150 and usual BS about sending out an engineer and a callout FEE. Same script different day.~~~,Lincoln~~~,2018-12-10~~~,2,3,2,1

I have been having issues with the router since mid October  contacted BT on numerous occassions  speaking most of the time to rude staff who were sending me instructions for hub 5 or smart hub while I have got hub 4! They were aware as they had asked before. Asking me to split connection  etc. Ended up with having 3 engineers who ordered new hub for me. It didn't arrive so I contacted them  they don't know anything about it! Once it arrived  the speed has dropped so complained again  then they sent me some texts and asked to reply what would cost me extra money. In addition  on one occassion I asked when my broadband contract would expire  lady told me the 4th of January. I rang them at the beginning of December to cancel  I was told that line rental contract expires on that day  broadband contract in July. So lazy! Honestly  I'm fuming  never had such bad issues with Sky or Virgin. I can't wait the contract to be finished!~~~,Manchester~~~,2018-12-10~~~,1,1,3,2
I though Virgin media was bad but god damn ! BT sucksssssss just like the guy below stated no BT internet and its been 3 weeks that the board band box arrived. Called emailed chatted about 10-15 times to only get a email of a manger who said ''To help with your query please call BT on : 0800 800 150. Sorry we cant help on this query.'' Damn need to start listening to reviews !! Virgin medai was bad for me but BT! I didn't even get to try it. sorry im leaving.~~~,hampshire~~~,2018-12-10~~~,1,1,1,1

Annoyed that BT do hard credit searches when your just enquiring about the date/ cost of broadband and don’t go through with the order. They should let you know~~~,Edinburgh ~~~,2018-12-07~~~,1,1,1,1
BT custemer for phone many years and broadband for a few years. Switch to Fibre but had 9 days without broadband due line not set up. First person claim ethernet cable and would take 5 works to receive this to sort problem which was wrong and needed engineer. 6 days after second person said engineer required. spoke to rude line manager offer £10 as complaint. then tried to charge £85 for the engineer which was the incorrect as previous showed under £50. finally had engineer solve broadband and he confirmed normally no charge for fibre set up. spoke to second link manager about complaint again poor service and like previous manager lied about complaint service at BT. not all staff are bad as previously spoken to other members in other offices and ok. Broadband staff are just poor at everything. BT just rubbish and I would never use them again~~~,Surrey~~~,2018-12-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"If you plan switching to BT  beware they would cut your existing broadband service on Friday morning and leave you whole weekend and bank holiday without Internet connection - which has happened to me. And they won't give you any compensation either. What they boasted ""Switching today  connected tomorrow"" is totally ******** and lie. BE CAREFUL!!!~~~",London Croydon~~~,2018-12-05~~~,1,1,3,2
They are FULL OF ****.Besides the fact that they actually have speed drops constantly  their internet crashes on a weekly basis  super expensive and ling their asses off.On their superfiber page they lie about Virgin Media which was the best and fastest internet provider in UK for a long time and they will be the best stil.~~~,Slough~~~,2018-12-03~~~,1,1,1,1
I bought a BT broadband in 2016 and then renewd on 17.In 2018 when i was getting a problem with their speed download/upload speed and worst customer service experience ever i had in life  decide to change my provider spoken to BT few times about my last day of ending contract and so on. after switching provider  (in process)after few days later received an email from BT stating that i need to pay £86 for cancallation fee due to i am in contract with them till 2019. So i contacted BT customer service lady doesn't know what she is talking about and all the time TRYING to selling me BT package in a different ways. which i said NO for any package after waiting 45 min over the phone  customer service lady mentioned me i had renew my contract in arpil 18 for next 12 month contract. which i was completely disagreed with her as why would i will buy a new contract when i am already in contract and new contract is more expensive then old contract thirdly i had not received any emails or notifcation that about new contract or switching to new contract. I also mentioned about previous conversation with BT customer service agent which they had confirmed me my last date of ending contract in nov 18.Honeslty after spending 3 weeks talking to them its feel like on these customer service is Dumb  and stupid which doesn't understand as well as no communication with each other.IF this case not resolve here i will take it to MANAGING DIRECTOR and THEN COURT.Piss taker BT. Stay away from these morons.~~~,dartford~~~,2018-12-03~~~,1,1,3,2
"Following resetting of an e-mail password by an Indian call centre techie my e-mail stopped working. A quick call to 150 got me to Ireland where I was fed a line of utter BS yet promised a call back by an expert at a set time.  The duly appointed time came and went and was exceeded by two hours when a call mysteriously came through on my mobile - which I wasn't expecting. Unfortunately the call rang out. Ringing 150 again I was told that there was nothing that could be done  India would ring me again when they were able  they could not define a fixed time. Realising I was beaten  I hung up  did a quick internet search to find out how to complain. Yet another phone number and another wait for 15 mins for it to be answered by an abrasive woman from the ""Billing"" team who couldn't help me and was totally disinterested. When I asked why a member of Billing was answering a complaint call I was told we ALL answer complaints. It's nice to know that your complaint call is not going to a dedicated team but just some disinterested staff member who couldn't give a toss quite safely with no redress. I was told that things were the way they were and I would have to wait. The reason I was contacted by my associated mobile was because there was a fault with my landline - curious that - as I was talking to the hapless BT Billing bint by..... the supposedly faulty landline!!!!!!! Well  I am still waiting but I haven't been idle. After 20 years of being a loyal BT customer and after three abortive  painful and stilted calls with Indian customer service within that time period  I have finally had enough. I will be swapping to Plus Net who curiously enough despite their BT links offer a 30% cheaper equivalent package with call and tech support centres in .... Sheffield and Leeds and with an award winning customer service group to boot.. My opinion of BT is that it doesn't matter how long you have been with them  customer loyalty counts for nothing  they just don't give a ****... and are an unmitigated  24 karat shower of utter ordure and that is being polite. My advice  is to other disaffected customers is to vote with your feet and secure a better service at a more competitive price. - just like me.~~~",~~~,2018-12-03~~~,1,1,3,5
Worst internet I’ve ever experienced in my life.Slowest speeds  disconnecting constantly  the worst customer service  engineers seem to continually miss appointments and they give you  wait for it a whole ..... £10 as compensation!! Not like I’ve taken days off unpaid to sit and wait for them not to turn up so £10 doesn’t really come close!I’m moving in 6 days time and can not wait to never ever have to hear the name BT ever again! I’m paying for fibre optic broadband and get a whole 4 mb download speed  IF IM LUCKY.I can not describe how angry it makes me when I’m half way through a game or watching a film and boom it’s gone.Do yourselves a favour  never go near BT for anything  EVER.~~~,Swansea~~~,2018-12-02~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are rubbish. Decided to use two cans and some string. Send message by pigeon was much faster . Don't call them for advise as will bring out a side of you you did not know was in you. I turned into a monster because they are robot's spuying out pointless tech advise you have tried before you called them .charge you a fortune to tell you to switch it off and on  again.~~~,Kent countryside~~~,2018-12-01~~~,1,1,1,1
the greed is pathetic.went from £29 to£58 after 18 months.I don't know why they treat you as a mug while giving new customers a great deal.anyhow have switched to talk talk for £20.its up to us to leave after 1st contract ends.its dead easy your new supplier does all the work~~~,MIDLOTHIAN~~~,2018-12-01~~~,2,2,5,5
Get pushed from pillar to post  don't actually get factual answers  rude customer services  and now ain't even answering the phone  internet issues for nearly a week now. Been on phone for half hour and pay £44 for the previlege. Not a happy customer sort it out.~~~,Taunton~~~,2018-11-30~~~,2,1,2,1
This company is shocking I moved into my new home and gave 2 weeks notice to BT that I was moving. I spoke to home move team who explained I will be getting my hub posted and a engineer was booked also  I was happy with that set up.  On the day of the new hub arriving I rang to find out what time they were turning up. This is where the problems started. I was calling the customers services team they did not recognise i had moved and could not find the information regarding any engineers or Wi-Fi hub being sent then they cut me off.  I rang again and that person also said the same thing. I called up a 3rd time and they found my details without any problems? I was then told I would have to wait  3 more weeks with no phone  WiFi or TV. I made a complaint 1 week ago but have heard nothing back from them. They are the worse company I have dealt with  they lie and tell you stuff that is not true. The funny thing I have texts and email confirming it all.  I have no choice but to use these jokers I will be emailing the onbusman  and telling everyone because they want to ignore me.~~~,Silverstone~~~,2018-11-30~~~,1,1,4,4
Not even worth one star absolute disgrace set dates for activation no engineer comes  they continually have messed order up cancelled and re ordered  apparently that’s their process for me has happened four times in a month  and with that comes another arrival of new equipment and  their bill. I have been left lots of equipment I can’t use  and been without broad band service for over a month just  received another delay confirmed today . if u wise avoid bt and go elsewere~~~,Northern iteland~~~,2018-11-29~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Absolutely shocking  would not recommend to anyone  waited nearly a month for connection still waiting  was told if I cancel and go to another provider that everyone goes through open reach and I would start all over again and would end up waiting longer  guess what a week after that get a call from bt saying they have cancelled my order by mistake and guess what got to start again  wished I'd gone elsewhere  it's more like customer we don't care.~~~,Shavington Crewe ~~~,2018-11-27~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Terrible customer service. Needed to switch to a new account after other flatmate moved out but we were already using BT. They had no problem turning off our broadband but haven't set up a new connection. Get fobbed off every time I call with no one taking action or accountability to see our problem to resolution. I have to call every time and explain the problem and then get connected through to a different person where I have to explain again. Would never have gone with them if I had read the reviews first.~~~,London~~~,2018-11-26~~~,1,1,1,1
This is a terrible service. Slow speed  dropouts  OMG this is so bad.Do not sign up with these guys.~~~,DORSET~~~,2018-11-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst experience of my whole business career. I don’t want to go into deatil as I simply don’t want to waste anymore time. Ended up costing my company thousands. Find another supplier for business phone and broadband.~~~,Ayr~~~,2018-11-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely disgusted with BT! Have cancelled service within 14day cooling off period because they have failed to instal my new phone line and broadband on 2 occasions and failed to send engineer despite promising a visit todaySpent hours and talked to many agents on phone to no avail  so have cancelled the service.BT are utter rubbish and I advise you to avoid them like the plague!~~~,Croydon~~~,2018-11-23~~~,1,1,1,1

Ridiculous WiFi  slow speeds paying for 50 barely getting 10mb/s   poor connection issues  says it’s connected but no internet   download speeds are better in potato than their hubs and you’d get better customer service from a lamppost than one of their staff keeping you on hold through till your mid 20’s~~~,Smith~~~,2018-11-22~~~,2,1,2,2
horrible customer service. kept me at home all day just to inform me that the engineer has postponed the visit to tomorrow on his own! while the system still gave today's date and sent confirmations on the arrival of the engineer. customer service has no idea and just apologizes. worst provider ever. don't even think of trusting BT. they will screw you over their monopoly position over and over.~~~,london~~~,2018-11-21~~~,1,1,1,1
I've never left a review for a company before so I think that says enough. I would advise anyone to leave BT alone. Absolute crooks. Increase the price whenever they choose. Always make everything in their favour. They charge you for everything. Tell you that you can't cancel till they say pretty much even though they know my internet is faulty. The TV service is dreadful and about 20 years behind sky. When you phone you'll be passed around departments for fun. Please avoid them. Price started at £45 a month then shortly into my contract they upped it to £53 because they can! Oh and we had a month of trouble 18 months ago with the 4k box as well. Will not miss them. Got to wait another month till I'm free. Never again will I gone with BT.~~~,Yorkshire~~~,2018-11-21~~~,1,1,2,2
I bought a broadband in London from BT in order to get some wifi. It took me more than two months  and 6 engineer visits  wich 4 never showed up. I still don't have wifi by this time  and when you cal service  they'll find excuses for all of this  by saying that it's not their fault  when it is.You will be also the one in charge of pushing them to work  will need to call them every day for over a month period of time asking them info about all of this.DO NOT get bt  if you don't want to spend a lot of useless time to useless service.~~~,London~~~,2018-11-19~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The worst provider I've ever been with. The connection always goes down  is ridiculously slower than what I was told I would get when it does work  and they were 2 weeks late installing it. Couldn't hate a company more!~~~,Carlisle ~~~,2018-11-19~~~,1,2,1,1
I have been a bt customer for 3 years  my contract is for 42mb/sec I get about 4mb/sec tops! @£29pcm if your a day late in paying which happens to me a lot as I'm on benifets you get disconnected which includes a charge of £12.99! 5his months bill was £41.98  I spoke 5o a lovely woman in India who was quite helpfull but not overly so. BT is a terrible broadband provider when it comes to the money grabing scheme  as for the actual broadband its slow at best depending on the server your connected to  for example if your watching the YouTube it's slow to the point that 6our video will start and stick to a very low quality like 480p until you manually up it to 1080p  general Internet page searching is not fast like pre 1mb speeds however if connecting to a Microsoft server for xbox I get a good deal 40 odd mb/sec which is great. You can have all this for a mer 29 quid per month. I will not be updating my contract this time and can not recommend at all.~~~,UK Swindon ~~~,2018-11-17~~~,~~~,2,~~~,2
BT has the worse customer service iv ever dealt with  i was happy till i moved in february 2018 and i was a fibre customer  they put me on slow internet speed and didn't tell me and made me a new contract which i couldn't get out of at the time  when they claimed to put me on fibre my download speeds dropped more than the slow speed one i was getting  so after months with poor customer service and arguing i told them where to go with there broadband  i was also a mobile customer and with out my say so they claimed i said yes to cancel my mobile deals so when i was cut off i called them for 3 days trying to get the pac code so i can keep my number  cause the sims where cut off they can not generate a pac code  they may speak english but they dont understand english  i will never use them again  and i advice anyone else to go else where and save yourself the agro.~~~,Kent~~~,2018-11-15~~~,1,1,1,1
In the last 6 months the broadband service we receive has been unreliable ranging from 2Mbps - 6Mbps. For a week we did actually get speeds of around 15Mbps  so it is really hard to understand why the service is so very poor for the majority of the time. I'm switching from BT as my Demon Internet is much more reliable.~~~,East Anglia~~~,2018-11-14~~~,2,1,2,1
I won’t bore you with the story. However take the advice and do join another provider. Even though BT are a very large company they are clearly going through some serious money issues. The service is shocking and never worked properly. They will over charge you and make it near impossible for you to get your money back. Don’t be suckered in by the introductory offer  you will be better off paying more else where and the price being fixed however still receiving good full working service. BT customer service is pathetic. Again they have cut costs with over seas call centres reducing the customer service levels.~~~,Leeds~~~,2018-11-14~~~,1,1,1,1
I've put one star because there is no option for 0. I am a new BT customer and have been plagued with lack of service  poor customer care and incorrect billing. The time spent trying to sort this out has cost me far more than any prospective savings from lower bills for the 18 month contract period and I wish I never switched.It took BT over a month to connect me from the first visit.In that time BT closed tickets telling me the problem was solved yet I did not have the service I was being charged for. Just as I  finally get sent an engineer that knew what he was doing and does connect me  I am incorrectly charged £130 for the engineer visit. This fee is only meant to apply where the fault is with the customer (either on their property or with their equipment). This was not the case with me and I was told by the engineer that the fault was further down the line.I do not like the way BT assume the customer is in the wrong at every step of the way. I am complaining to get the matter rectified  but I bet there are many people who do not understand what they are being charged for and just pay the money. This has been a terrible customer journey. I do not only NOT RECOMMEND  I would actively say GO ANYWHERE ELSE!~~~,Newmarket~~~,2018-11-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Multiple week delays on installation leaving me without internet for a period despite having left a generous overlap with my previous provider (Hyperoptic). Thankfully hyperoptic were able to extend my previous package without issue to cover this. My new BT internet cuts out on a regular basis. Speeds slower than previous provider. Signed up in April  2 months later they raised my package price by 15%. Apparently I missed a letter and have now cannot dispute this. Customer service unhelpful  generally unable to answer simple questions. Very unimpressed  service with other providers has been far better.~~~,Manchester~~~,2018-11-13~~~,1,2,3,1
