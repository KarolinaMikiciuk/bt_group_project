over all satisfaction veer poorcustomer service extremely POORBroadband speed Poor never experienced 1 MB for the serviette they sold me as 10MbBroadband readability very poor often without.

AVOID by all means for your own mental wellbeing! This is the worst service I have ever experienced. I don't have broad bond for 8 days and when I call after 45 mints just they hung on me. I spent hours on the phone my finally send me the wrong product. I returned and yet I have to call them and spend hours on the phone again. The bill I received was wrong one single call £165.23 duration of 17 hours. I went throng hell till they reduce it to under £20. £155 over charge for broadband over use. Requested to give a unlimited package they refused as I should wait for 12 month no broad bond service as everyone fright to goes over limit and however the compute shows 3.08Gb use the BT does not accept this fact  their meter is always 10 to 15 times over the Windows 10 usage meter.   Therefore we came to conclusion not to use the service at all. Pleas if you’re not checking your bill try to do it and you will see: 1- the duration is over extended to cheat you. My last bill duration is states from period of 24 March to 23 June but it is covers charges from 1 March to 23 September 2016 this is not quarterly bill.  My last bill is a similar period notice things has been paid for and again reappear in the new bill  when to discuss this with Indian operator she /he says cannot do anything but my boss will call you but you never receive that call and again you have to explain to the new operator and the cycle repeats.     Pleas avoid this company  I can't wait for August to when the contract ends and I am free to go.  DO AVOID!~~~,London~~~,2016-07-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Terrible custormer service was on hold for 30mins to be diverted and on hold another 10mins  take money they arnt supposed to then try to justify it to you! Con artists and not good people dont give them your money~~~,PAIGNTON~~~,2016-07-02~~~,1,1,1,1
I opted to join the new BT revolution from sky TV following the EPL games being shown. I would have signed up for the whole package and found a great deal online including cash back. The first (broadband) order was cancelled as apparently sky tv put a cease on the line. I cleared this with Sky and put in a second order (which was also cancelled) so after faffing around with their automated system I eventually got through to someone who did a line check and confirmed the cease had been lifted but not before I put in the second order. So I losing patience put through a third order  this was also cancelled. This time I lost my patience and asked to speak with a manager  I was told one wasn't available despite one having already  cancelled the the third order. I was told one would call me back on Friday coincidently AFTER the deal had finished. I did receive call but on the house phone (they did have my mobile number but obviously decided it wasn't worth calling on that). I called back as soon as I arrived home from work. I waited on hold for 24 minutes then was told (by you guessed right  an automated service) that it was now 8pm and they were now closed (no sh** Sherlock!).Their service (if you can call it that is utterly shocking and I would NEVER use these clowns).~~~,London~~~,2016-07-01~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
The service is terrible . The automated system with varying voice tones to keep you in order is terrible . The engineers analysis is sometimes very poor . Over 6 hours of my time on the phone trying to get them to sort it and in the end sorted it myself using an old hub . Now I wait for a replacement hub . They don't pay recompense for list time   time off work   lost use of equipment or anything .~~~,Peterborough~~~,2016-07-01~~~,2,~~~,4,3
"The worst customer service I have ever experienced. We pay for ""super fast fibre optic"".... What a joke! The connection regularly drops out  the speed is often less than 1MB  and BT do naff all about it!! We have had 2 cancelled engineer visits because BT are unable to organise a p*ss up in a brewery! To top it all off  if we want to cancel it is £150 for the pleasure. AVOID BT!!~~~",Essex~~~,2016-06-29~~~,1,1,1,1
I moved to a house that had been already using BT for a couple of months. The service got broken 2 weeks ago. We have contacted BT several time and every time they gave us different reason and different expected date to fix the issue. It has been two weeks now with no explanation from them. It is irritating and i would never every recommend BT for someone else.~~~,Hove~~~,2016-06-29~~~,1,1,1,1
If you want to have the worst experience possible then you have come to the right place.BT are horrendous for customer service  they don't care about the customer alls they want is your money  whether or not they are providing the service that you are both in contract for.I had nothing but problems for the month and a half that I was with them.Even when I cancelled they tried to bill me £500+ for cancelling as they said I was breaching the contract by terminating early. Even after I quoted their terms and conditions to them (and emailed the advisor the terms and conditions and the link to their website) they still tried to charge me.They don't have a clue what they are doing and don't care about the customer.Worst company ever... Sky all the way~~~,"highlands, scotland~~~",2016-06-29~~~,1,1,1,1
For several months my Homehub 2 was cutting out. I reported it twice and was fobbed off by customer services who said it was - connected to wrong socket/interference by microwave/cordless phone etc etc. They would not believe the homehub could be faulty.In the end I bought a Homehub 3 from ebay and have had no problems since. They appear to have logged only one complaint even though I complained twice earlier this year and refuse to compensate me for several months bad service.~~~,Solihull~~~,2016-06-28~~~,1,1,5,1
BT customers service is the worst I've ever received (and I've had some bad service). I wanted to change the contract we had into my name - everything else to remain the same and they wouldn't allow me to do so witho paying £50 connection fee even though they weren't connecting anything- nothing at all was changing. When I refused to do that and asked to cancel the contract they charged me £30+ to cancel- even though I was out of contract. Just plain scam artists  would never use again.~~~,Enfield~~~,2016-06-28~~~,1,1,2,2
8 months  21 case managers  10 engineers  and 4 missed work days later - you can probably see that I have had enough. BT's level of customer service (especially after outsourcing their departments to Banglore) is shocking and unacceptable for these reasons: 1) the did not deliver the services I paid for2) are using delay tactics to out stretch any chance of rebate3) they lie and use deception to give an impression they are dealing with my complaint  as every person I spoke to was swapping roles  reciting the same script  redirecting me to one of their colleagues4) wasted my time by not reviewing my case before calling5) not informing me when engineers would be coming  not accommodating for vulnerable people6) were rude and intimidating7) try and get people other than the account holder to close faults.  My family and I have been severely distressed during this ordeal. We did not have a working phone line for a period or time so my elderly mother could not call the emergency services if she needed an ambulance  nor did I have any piece of mind in case my children were to fall ill  and my professional life has suffered as I could not access work resources to work from home. I have financially lost out a lot more than I ever expected. I have had to spend additional money on travelling to work when there was no need to do so  incurred additional mobile phone costs  and more importantly have had my time wasted which is something I will never get back. I am still having my time wasted wrapping up this issue and do not want to simply change providers for my phone line and internet because if BT own the communication infrastructure  getting it resolved by someone else will be an even longer process. I am a realistic person and accept there are factors which may affect my services  but what cannot be justified is the unacceptable level of customer service  the unrealistic fix times especially when vulnerable people are involved  and the lack of consideration for the customer.~~~,London~~~,2016-06-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I was Ok with BT   not the best line speed with drop outs etc but the main problem was when i came to move home. I arranged the move and they told me all would be fine and i would be connected within a week. It didn't happen and they ended up cancelling my contract and told me  that as I had cancelled early there would be an early termination charge. I have not been able to resolve this and when i asked them to connect me as a matter of urgency they said it would take another 3 weeks.They don't listen or care and when things do go wrong they make no attempt to correct it~~~,GL74BW~~~,2016-06-26~~~,1,1,3,3
Terrible!  Wow  avoid completely. I am astounded at the level of customer service the company offers.  Truly sad.  My poor 70+ year old mother moved and when setting up her phone in her new flat the line would not call in (calls out were fine at first).  She called to let them know.  A very unhelpful person told her to disconnect the phone and plug it into the box.  This did not work  and after plugging the phone back in outgoing calls stopped working as well.  That is when she was told it was the developers problem and not BTs.  Obviously  it is BT problem as the prior tenant  the landlord (who lives in the building)  and other neighbors do not have this problem.  After sitting on hold  speaking with multiple so-called customer service reps  having my called dropped  having loud noises played in my ear  I have decided to file with the OFcom for dispute resolution to have the non-working line that my poor retired mother is paying for.   Truly sad  and very disappointed that any service provider with the name British in it would treat a senior this way.  How  er  un-british at best  more like a scam.~~~,London~~~,2016-06-25~~~,1,1,1,1
They promised me broadband speed of 6-8mbps when I signed up  and I've never had more than 2mbps. 6 weeks later  still no closer to them even admitting there's a problem.~~~,Southbourne Dorset ~~~,2016-06-25~~~,2,2,1,3
If you want to lose the will to live  choose bt infinity.I have had it installed for 15 months.It has never worked properly.I have spent over 45 hours on the phone  had engineers visit 4 times  had 3 sets of bt powerline adapters  had 3 different tv boxes and have never had a reliable working broadband and wi-fi.The last engineer ( 3 weeks ago) said that it would not ever work in our house.bt will not let us out of the contract even though they are not providing the service as advertised.~~~,leamington spa~~~,2016-06-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband down for 10 days now. 3 times told will be fixed within 24 hours. 3 engineers visits cancelled by BT. Impossible to speak to a human being  except 1 who registered my formal complaint. Switched to Sky in frustration and got an immediate response that I owe BT £150 for cancelling their contract. But in law a contract is to supply services and they aren't! Apparently they have 28 days to resolve service outages. How can you run a business like that? Avoid BT like the plague. Oh and they said that if I switch they won't resolve the fault! Nice.~~~,London ~~~,2016-06-24~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
What a joke BT is. Broadband line regular drops the connection. Down speed in between 1 and 2 Mbps and upload today is .24! service from the helpline is a nonsense. They have no understanding about broadband not about BT equipment - they just tick boxes and read from the script. AVOID BT.~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2016-06-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I wish I could score zero.the worst company I have ever dealt with.a few weeks ago I decided to switch from another provider i placed my order and paid my money bt cancelled it ordered again same result placed a third time once again cancelled.i went back to my original provider.meanwhile despite not havinga bt order I have now had three hubs delivered to me and even had a text to confirm a date for engineer to install tv.really could not make it up.they are also sending bills but worst of all I cannot get my money back from them it s a lot of money so I won t stop until I get it back.i am now getting my bank involved then Ofcom watchdog and paper.please do not use this incompetent useless company.BT should be ashamed of themselves but they don t seem yo care~~~,dunblane~~~,2016-06-21~~~,1,1,1,1
I have just moved house and was going to transfer my BT Broadband to the new address however when looking into things i saw that my original deal had ended and that I was now paying £47 and i don't even use the phone as I have a digital number  BAD DEAL In my opinion they should have sent me a letter regarding the new increased charge. I phoned up Sky and they can offer exactly the same deal for £17  so much better and you are effectively getting exactly the same thing. So I called up BT to cancel my package and they said that I needed to give them 30 days notice and pay a cancelation fee of £31. All in all this a lot of money wasted and I will not be returning to BT because of this.Yes this stuff is probably all in the small print but in my mind this is just a way of fleecing consumers because people don't tend to read this stuff  and they know it. Not impressed BT  short term thinking.~~~,Lewes~~~,2016-06-21~~~,1,3,2,~~~

"AVOID joining BT at all costs!!! My partner signed up to get BT sports  he cancelled it in September as we were moving house. We've ended up with a debt collecting agency on our backs with a huge bill!! Partner spoke to them at BT who said they had not received a notice of cancellation.. when he asked where the bill had come from and what is was for they said it's because we didn't pay our cancellation fee.. so why would we pay a cancellation fee if theyre saying they haven't cancelled it!?!?!? Totally contradictory!!!When we asked why did nobody contact us via telephone to sort out this matter sooner we were told ""That is not how we operate""Very unhelpful customer services  they talk out of their arses!!Such a big company and yet dissatisfying customers all the time it seems.. absolutely disgraceful - it's be because of greedy firms like BT why people like us who work hard for a living end up in debt!!! Which could have easily been rectified with a phone call.. Going to take this further we are absolutely livid!!!~~~",Manchester~~~,2016-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1
I tried to place an order for internet and there was hidden fees when I got to the end of the order process. I called to helpline to query the added fees and was met by an unhelpful individual who told me the fees where to install a BT line despite a BT line being in the property already. He also gave me a false name on the phone followed by abuse. However  BT are conveniently unable to trace the call. I would avoid at all costs!~~~,Huddersfield~~~,2016-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1

Infinity 1 installed on Friday. Over the weekend had problems with access and internet stability. Phoned help desk and was told it takes 48 hours to settle but they would monitor my line. Phoned again on Tuesday because the problems persisted. Connection speed 5Mbps. Told that my order was still open which could cause slow internet and that someone would phone me. Phoned again Wednesday as no improvement and no phone call as promised. The help desk put in a fault and said they would monitor the line. I told them they had promised that on my first call but their records did not reflect that. Also no record of the promise to phone me. I now have to wait for a call within the next 48 hours to let me know what they are doing to fix the problem. I am willing to place a bet that they will not phone me. I told them I will not be paying for the internet until it performs as advertised.The advertised offer also CLEARLY stated BT SPORTS with BT infinity 1. After installation I was told it was only BT SPORTS LITE and if I wanted BT SPORTS I would have to pay an extra £5 per month.I deeply regret changing my internet provider and will cancel my BT contract if they fail to improve service.~~~,southend on sea~~~,2016-06-15~~~,1,1,1,1

I have never experienced such poor customer service on all fronts.  I have just raised a security issue and been told that to fix it I will have to use a chargeable service. I spent countless hours online and on the phone trying to fix the infinity connection problems and it was like getting blood out of a stone.  I am counting down to the end of the contract with bt.~~~,London~~~,2016-06-15~~~,2,1,4,3

I attempted to upgrade to fibre as the copper speeds I was getting we're slow and I could not stream reliably. Also internet based heating system kept failing in view of poor broadband reliability. Upgrading to fibre was disastrous. There was a glitch with the address (incorrect house number listed on open reach network) so the engineers kept going to wrong address. BT would not fix and ultimately B was left with no broadband. Any interaction with them takes 1 to 2 hours via a call centre off shore. Problems need to be explained time and time again. After about 8hours on hold over a 6 period and failure of their complaints department to fix things I gave up and left.~~~,Oxford~~~,2016-06-14~~~,1,1,2,2
Son signed up to BT whilst I was away and they authorised payment! Came back from holiday and realised we have a new internet. Mis-sold product to low allowance mb so upgraded to infinity package. This made our contract expand meaning our cancellation date was set to a longer date. Poor customer service line  speaks general and defensive over their T&C's and do not value a customer realising they are leaving them and moving to their competitors. BT TV hardly works and always have to restart the modem and then they blame it on our area. I live in the heart of London  how is that possible? I do not live between mountains. Overall  will not recommend to ANYONE.~~~,london~~~,2016-06-11~~~,1,1,3,2
"Customer service is having to wait 30 minutes for an answer  then another 30 minutes for the ""technician"" to mess about. They then tell you that it is all OK now but will have to wait 24 hours for it to reach full speed. 2 hours later broadband is running goin so slowly that my e-mail server is timing out when retrieving mail. I suppose that I'll have to go through it all again tomorrow!~~~",Llanharan~~~,2016-06-08~~~,2,1,3,2

Do not use BT.  We are consistently receiving a broadband speed of 0.2 to 0.7 megabytes  nowhere near the PROMISED 1MB.  We can only use one device at a time and  even then  we get messages stating that our broadband speed is insufficient.Terrible customer service who say that the exchange is 1.2 MB  so they have fulfilled their part of the contract.   AVOID!~~~,"Minting, Lincolnshire~~~",2016-06-04~~~,1,1,1,1
I must be one of the lucky ones after reading such bad reviews. I've been with BT for a number of years and only had one problem when our phone line went dodgy. But overall  the speed isn't as fast as it could be  but it's okay. Customer service is pretty good. They have made the effort to call me back when I've been on the wrong shift. Broadband reliability is good too. No breakdowns. In fact when I switched to BT from Virgin and Virgin turned me off three weeks early  BT gave me 4000 minutes of free internet to tide me over until they connected me. Now that has to be good service.~~~,Hereford~~~,2016-06-02~~~,4,5,4,5
