I've had BT broadband just over two years. I have had to have an engineer call out five times. The customer service is beyond awful. The trouble is that BT supplies broadband for all the other providers so what can you do? It's an outrageous monopoly. What a shame BT wants to supply sports instead of sticking to its knitting an providing a decent broadband service. I'll be switching to fibre as soon as it is available in our area from anyone except BT.~~~,Coventry~~~,2015-11-16~~~,1,1,2,1
I'm a new customer to BT having suffered low speeds and endless drop outs with Sky for a year. I wouldn't have believed it but BT's speed is worse and their customer service is shocking. I've been trying to resolve an issue with my logon for 11 days but despite saying they will respond within 24 hours I have not received a response. I've tried to live chat with them but the slow broadband speed is hampering those attempts. The only good thing I can say is that my broadband doesn't drop out as much as it did with Sky.~~~,UK~~~,2015-11-16~~~,1,1,1,3
"2email accounts' whole inboxes we removed and put into ""deleted"" folders.  When I asked why this was happening an Indian adviser informed me I could go to BT help to recover these emails.  I wanted to know WHY the emails had been moved I'd already discovered them.  Then he said there was a ""glitch"" on his BT computer and could no longer help me.  This service is at best useless and there just is no accountability by BT for their appalling service to paying customers.  Their help menus are useless.  Why not give out telephone numbers as  on occasion  customers who phone them are unable to use the internet because it has failed! We've been told throughout 2015 that BT were dumping Yahoo but this still hasn't happened and BT are still not being held to account for the useless service on Yahoo email accounts.  Extremely poor service by BT to its customers.~~~",Cambridge~~~,2015-11-16~~~,1,1,2,2
Paying for 76mb and on a good day today n the middle of the night I manage to get 24mb. I do not live in the countryside and two roads down they get 60-80mb. Bt can not explain why this is  they only say the exchange is too far from my house. Really disappointed~~~,Southall~~~,2015-11-15~~~,4,4,1,3

Just received a package and after 4 days I have found out customer service is based in India and very poor. Promised a call back but never got one. They wait until you have to pay to cancel. I am trapped for a year now and will then leave them never to return. Not to be trusted.~~~,poole~~~,2015-11-13~~~,1,1,4,3
"Very disappointed and actually appalled with BT's customer service. Diabolical. We signed up to a BT Infinity package last December and when discussing the package on the phone my husband stressed it was important the new package would retain the ""International Freedom""package as I'm from Ireland and call there several times a week. Since we signed up apparently ""online""  we never received a paper quarterly  statement  and just recently we discovered on going through our household bills that for the past 10 months our BT bills (paid by direct debit) had doubled as were taken off the 'International Freedom' option when the BT Infinity contract started last December! BT have no interest whatsoever in trying to put matters right given that we calculate this mistake has cost us approx £600 in 10 months. We are very disappointed given that we have been with BT for many years and they have absolutely no interest in retaiing our business. My husband wrote a long letter to the customer service dept in Durham and received by way of response an incredibly poorly written shprt email (terrible grammar) basically saying ""computer says No"" without responding to the individual points raised in our letter.Separate to this incident I will also say that we had phone line problems twice in the same period  the most recent one meant we were without a phone for approx a week. Very Poor.Anyhow actively seeking an alternative supplier and  would urge you all to do the same!~~~",Bournemouth~~~,2015-11-12~~~,1,1,2,2
Swapped from Sky. DON'T DO IT!!!I was supposed to have my broadband a week ago- still not been set up which is ridiculous considering I need the internet for work purposes. Now told it won't be sorted until at least Monday (that's 11 days with no internet) Keep getting lied to. 'We'll ring you with an update'....three times I've been given that message. I've had to spend countless evenings on hold. Worst company ever. Makes me think it's cheap for a reason.~~~,Cardiff~~~,2015-11-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Ordered bt broadband and tv box about 2weeks ago. The engineer was supposed to show up a week ago. Guess what. Nobody didnt show up. Took a day off work just for that.. nobody didnt contact me about it either. Next day had to call them myself. Apparently it was supposed to be workin till yesterday 12pm. Guess what.. nothing working.. Absolutely poor service. Sorry but BT deserves 0.1 out of 10. Poor poor poor. If you have a choice  choose some other broadband provider..Shame on you bt...~~~,Romford~~~,2015-11-12~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Broadband keeps disconnecting from wireless devices and its speed always fluctuates. One minute im getting 30mbps and the next im getting 1mbps. tried to get help many times from bt but their employees are just useless and clueless. If virgin provided fibre optic broadband here i would switch without a trace of hesitation~~~,ki~~~,2015-11-10~~~,2,1,2,1
All went well until broadband kept crashing!  then customer service failed bt no end.  I waited for phone calls that were promised but never came!    It wasn't until I blew after no end of me calling them it has been decided to send me a new home hub but even then I have pay out for delivery! NOT IMPRESSED!~~~,somerset~~~,2015-11-09~~~,1,1,3,3
Continuous appalling service since moving home and trying to transfer our old telephone number. On moving day text to say phone was up and running  but no service to house. On checking our number we find its gone to the local Bus Company. Constant ringing to Customer Services (via offshore call centre) we're told there is nothing wrong with the line. I agree  but say the line is not where it should be. Over 3 weeks of continuous calls eventually get line transferred  but Broadband is connected / working. Further calls  delays no turn ups eventually get Broadband on. 2 days later it fails  faulty hub. New Hub sent  doesn't work resort to old server which works fine.this weekend line / Broadband fails  no service. 3 hours so far on calls. I fear the nightmare is about to begin again.BT service is appalling ~~~,swanley~~~,2015-11-09~~~,5,1,1,1
absolutely shocking customer service  will never ever use bt again. after having to move house and being stuck in a contract with no way out than to pay an extortionate amount. rang them up 1 month before the contract was going to end and they said i cant cancel without a cancellation charge so i rang up once my contract ended only to be told i need to give 30 days notice that i wanted to cancel!!! and a cherry on the top was the fact that i also have to pay a £30 termination charge for cancelling my services altogether!!!!! absolute rip off and i will be complaining + going to trading standards with my experiences!!~~~,Leicester~~~,2015-11-09~~~,1,1,1,1
"A main pitch of BT Sales  why to switch to Infinity broadband  is a stronger more reliable connection.  In the 7 weeks since switching it has proved the worst in 20 years of internet connection  even dial-up was better.  Sporadic drops  possibly more frequent afternoon and evening.  On my third Home Hub 5 which crashed my PC 10 minutes after plugging it in  BT deny any responsibility.  Have referred case to Ombudsman  for what that may be worth  as I've had more than enough.  Feel I was mis-sold fibre broadband as BT's revisionist line is they can improve things so I get ""fewer"" drops; well if drops had been part of the sales proposition then I would never have signed up at all.~~~",Caterham~~~,2015-11-07~~~,1,1,3,1
BT are useless  I have 40mb fibre optic which should be a good speed and I am receiving 2.1 mb  the customer service told me this was a good speed which is absolute nonsense~~~,swansea~~~,2015-11-06~~~,1,4,1,1
If I could give negative in all of the options I would I have called frequently to have my diabolical Internet reliability addressed and it feels as if I am given a generic excuse maybe a box to keep me happy and swiftly forgotten about. The issue has never gone away never improved and I have to jump through the same 50 hoops everytime I want to talk to anyone remotely human go to any other Internet provider and I mean any other...

"Just joined BT phone + broadband + TV from Talk Talk. Can't complain about the service  but I will complain on two subjects. Receiving the equipment was diabolical  as I was told so many lies about delivery problems that I eventually received 2 sets of hardware within 2 days of each other and had to send one back. The other is the pricing policy. I joined 1 month ago  wasn't sure whether I would need 10G/month or unlimited  was told I could always upgrade later. Except that at the time of ordering the difference was £ 7  whereby if I do it now (1 month after joining) I have to pay £ 11/more more. ""Because you are already with BT"" I was told. And if I were to order the package now as a new customer  it would only pay £2.50 more!! Being a BT customer is definitely hazardous to the health of your portfolio...~~~",London~~~,2015-11-05~~~,1,2,3,3
"Well all  i hope your ready for a long  truthful review of BT... I switched to them on the 17th September of this year after 5 years with Sky.  My Sky speed was reliable and constant at around 9mb p/s.  We wanted to switch as a cost saving exercize by getting infinity and TV through BT at £65 a month instead of the £90 a month for Sky.  WHAT A MISTAKE!!! The order was placed on the 17th and the minimum guaranteed speed was 27mb with an email confirming the same and detailing within it (which i still have) that states that if the speed continually drops below this guaranteed speed i can cancel at any point.  It must be said here that when i contacted Sky to cancel  they were reluctant to let me go and they even offered to price match BT but the thing that made me move was the guarnteed speed that Sky couldn't give. Anyways  i signed up  cancelled Sky and got an email saying everything will be with you on the 29th September and all will be switched over within 30mins on the 1st of October. Well.... The 1st came and i plugged it all in and off we went  except we didnt.  I contacted BT and after 15 minutes of being on hold i was transferred to someone in India to be told ""oh there is an issue with getting the line from Sky  you will need to wait until the 7th October"".  Now you need to understand that i at this point had no internet or TV for a week.  Not easy with 2 kids and working from home.  Anyways  the 7th came and bingo  the line was ready...or so i thought.  Plugged it all in and away we went  light on the hub turned blue  conneted to the internet  did a speed test to show i was now getting 3mb p/s.  OK i thought  lets leave it a while and see what happens.  Turned on the Youview box and the light on the hub turned orange...no internet.  Left it a day and everytime i turned on the TV the internet dropped out so i was now in a situation where i could browse the net at 1/3 of my previous speed but not watch TV or i could watch TV but not get the internet channels  so i was basically paying to watch Freeview or browwse the net at stone age speeds. So i contacted BT again and waited an age to get through to someone promising me the Earth who told me there must be a problem with the hub.  So they informed me they will send me a new hub which will be there within a few days.  It arrived on the 11th October.  Plugged it in  away we went...NO CHANGE!!! Now by this point i was beginning to get pi**ed off.  Contacted them back and eventually got through to someone who as per all other calls wanted to start off by asking me what type of phone socket i had in my house etc etc etc.  At this point i bit my tongue hard.  Anyway  she told me she was going to send me new filters because they must be the problem.  I swiftly told them NO  do not send me anything else.  Send me an engineer.  She didnt want to do this so i got refered to some sort of support line.  They told me they needed 48 hours to do some checks on the line and they would call me back.  Well that 48 hours came and went with no call.  So i called them...AGAIN. Got through to someone  they confirmed my line was OK to my house and that it was stable and that it must be something in the house causing the issue.  Like  i told them 48 hours before hand.  This was now the 14th October.  No need for new equipment the person said.  We will send an engineer.  Great  progress at last. 3 Days later an engineer turns up from Openreach  now the 17th October and he changes the main socket in the house to an MK3.  He gets the speed to 20mb/s and at which point i tell him that i have been promised 27mb/s or i can cancel.  At which point he laughs and says ""you have no idea how many houses i go to with the same problem.  BT promise speeds that they cant deliver"".  He then says he is goin to the exchange to see what he can do.  He returns shortly after to tell me the most i will EVER get at my house is 21mb/s and off he goes. So in the midst of all this BT kindly take £70 out of my account on the 15th for my bill from the 17th September.  Not impressed in the slightest i call and ask for a refund to be told that i cant get one until the issue is resolved.  I quickly remark that it isnt resolved.  The line keeps dropping when on TV or saying inadequate signal recieved please go to bt help.com. I then tell her i want to cancel because the Openreach engineer has told me i will never get 27mb/s and i want to return to Sky.  The lady was OK with this but she needed to refer me to technical support to see what they can do and that i will need to wait 7 days for a call back.  Well  7 days came and went and by now it was the mid-end of October.  I called BT AGAIN  and explained the story AGAIN with the cancellations team to get the worst call handler yet and she was british.  She had a stinking attitude.  I explained i wanted to cancel and that i hadnt recieved a call from BT when i was promised.  She rudely told me that someone from BT spoke to me on the phone at 1654 for 5 minutes.  I reassured her that if i dial 1471 on my house phone  the last person to call it was a family member at 11.11 (by this time it was now 1800ish).  She then said  no it was on your mobile.  I took my mobile out of my pocket and looked to see if i had a missed call or whatever.  I didnt.  I was leaving for home from work at 1654.  I told her that she is either lying or the caller is because i recieved no calls.  She the proceeded to tell me that she is not a liar.  I said  well can you tell me the conclusion of the call please?  Can you check the notes of the call and tell me what was discussed because as far as i am concerened i am calling to cancel because i have not recieved the call  otherwise i wouldnt be calling.  She then told me she cant access the notes of another caller (funny because all the other BT staff could read my previous notes).  Anyway  after a lot of angry exchanges  i was told by her that her job wasnt worth cancelling my contract without technical saying so.   I asked her how long will it take to cancel if technical can put a note on the system saying its ok to cancel  she then said it could be cancelled straight away.   I asked her to put me through to technical support AGAIN.  After 30 minutes on hold i get through to India.  I am told by the tech support that the other call back didnt take place because the other caller didnt do anything about my cancellation request as he could (funnily enough) read the notes.  He then said that he cannot put the cancellation request on the system until it goes through the line checks and technical for 7 days.  So either he is lying or the cancellation lady is. By this point i am losing the plot with them.  He told me that he will lodge the call with tech support or whatever it is and that on the 3rd Nov they would call me back.  They called and i said ""is it cancelled?""  he then said no not yet  we are still testing things or whatever they are doing.  He confirmed the speed on the line is 20mb/s and he said it will take another 4 days.  He said ""is 20m/b no fast enough for me""?  I said  it doesnt matter if its fast enough  you promised me a certain minimum speed which i am not getting.  I left Sky after 5 years for that sole reason.  No other as the price was the same. I will now await their call on the 7th Nov  at which point if its not cancelled and i am not reimbursed my £70 plus compensated via my phone bill  i will take the matter to a solicitor  watchdog and whomever else. I would strongly advise EVERYONE who is considering BT to stay well clear of them.  I have never in my life experienced such unprofessionalism or disrespect towards a customer as i have with BT and i will NEVER buy from them or reccommend them to anyone. p.s. 2 weeks ago i asked the BT advisor if i was OK to go ahead and re-order Sky TV etc and she said yes.  So if i am placed in a situation where i have 2 contracts to pay for a year i will be looking to sue them.  I am glad all these calls are recorded because i have done nothing but try and cancel my agreement with them because of misrepresentation. If i went to a showroom to buy a car and was only give 70% of it i'd be able to return it after being promised the whole thing.  The same applies here.~~~",Aberdeen~~~,2015-11-04~~~,1,1,1,1
I was quite pleased with BT but there prices kept going up and up so I decided to leave them I received a letter which I found threading and because I am coming out my contract a bit before it ends the are going to charge me over £70 which I find exorbitant as being a pensioner that's a lot of money these companies have you over a barrel so be careful who you sign up with BT are not as good as you think they don't care about old customers.~~~,Sileby~~~,2015-11-03~~~,3,4,3,4
"Ive been with BT broadband/phone at one address since 23/5/2016 and also at another address have 02 Busines Broadband/phone. O2 are fantastic a 10/10 service. BT on the other hand has been like going to a pub and having a bad pint every time. Each time ""Hello how are you today sir and here's your next bad pint at hotel prices.I've almost resigned to cancelling my contract and paying up the 6 months £179.66 disconnection fee to restart anew with a supplier that has a high customer service. My broadband speeds are about the lowest Ive ever experienced. Why the hell does BT trade like this  excellent sales set up and no backup. My BT experience started off with them consistently installing the wrong phone number. I would then get a text from BT along the lines . We aplogies for installing the wrong number however the correct number has now been installed. Again and again the number was not correct and once again a wrong number so back to being on hold and going through it all again . Ive now had the correct number installed (I think) which has resulted in the following upgrade - I cant make incoming calls or outgoing calls and that has been the situation since last June. Its now be diagnosed today as a fault at the exchange and should be fixed within 3 days A long discussion on BT and compensation ensued. It ended with BT offering to refund £10 including VAT for the period in the first month when they charged £16.99 line rental.

Changed to B.T. from talktalk due to tele sales person stating how much better B.T. will be. Bthub4  B.T sport   satellite wifi hot spots etc. What they don't tell you is how painfully slow the broadband speed is.When i complained they stated I was only on a tariff which guarantees a line speed of 12kb/sec  if I wanted a faster broadband then I should go to infinity tariff at an extra cost of 15£/month I already pay 29£/month which only gives me bt sport1. Unfortunately I am under a 12 month contract but when this expires I will leave and never return to bt. Buyers beware.~~~,Stoke-on-Trent~~~,2015-11-02~~~,1,1,1,1

"I am trying to switch from Talk Talk to BT  partly because of their BT Sports App. I am now very close to telling them to forget it  having wasted many frustrating hours in trying to contact someone who will (a) answer the phone within a reasonable time and (b) give me any reliable information as to how the switch is progressing. Even though I have confirmation of my order  they have now informed me that it has been held up somewhere within their ""system"". If BT really do want people to switch to them they are definitely not going the right way about it.~~~",Cornwall~~~,2015-10-30~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
If I can give you one advice  please do not sign up to BT. I'm on their ADSL service  having transferred from Sky due to a new customer incentive and in hindsight one of the worst decisions I have made to-date and will be switching back to Sky the moment my contract expires later this year.The service is unreliable in that I constantly suffer drop-outs  which is one thing  however their customer service team based in India is absolutely shambolic. Totally embarrassing and so painful to go through. If you value your time and sanity I would suggest never giving these guys a go. I did hear similar reviews prior to switching over and wished I had heeded the warnings. I have never left a review before  but the service has been so poor I felt compelled to let others know. You have been warned.~~~,London~~~,2015-10-30~~~,~~~,~~~,2,~~~
Please do not use BT if you have any other alternative. Sadly we didn't. BT's customer service is appalling! It's taken us 15 months and literally hundreds of phone calls to get infinity broadband installed in our office. Just one example - on the day the engineer was due to upgrade us to infinity we stayed in the office specially but nobody turned up and we had no communication from BT. They also cut-off our 'normal' broadband service. Customer services told me that due to a 'technical error' the order had got 'stuck' and they couldn't restart our normal broadband service until the next engineer visit. They said they'd call back in 2 hours with the next visit date. They didn't. A week later we got notification of the next engineer visit  3 weeks later. On that visit the engineer did turn up but said he couldn't restart our broadband because all the information he'd been given about the exchange was wrong and the previous engineer's notes (the one who didn't turn up!) were incomplete. Back to customer services. The woman there had no record of any engineer visits and was almost in tears because Open Reach wouldn't take her calls. So it goes on...~~~,Oxford~~~,2015-10-30~~~,1,1,1,1
BT I would love to watch your programmes alas I have been waiting for an instillation of a phone line and Internet for weeks. I have had so many text messages stating we are coming today and never show up  never mind that I have to take a day off work!!!

Our broadband is constantly going off  fed up with being threatened with charges if a fault is not found and to topic all  had an appointment yesterday soda to stay in from 8am to 1pm.  Sometime during the morning the broadband was going on and off so maybe an engineer was working on it.  However no contact with us to say if work had been done or if problem fixed.  Where is common courtesy at least a call to say what is going on.     We are in a rural location which seems to be an excuse for poor service and low speeds.  WE get better and faster broadband in the Bahamas on an island 5 miles long. It is possible but I guess we just do not matter enough.~~~,Shropshire~~~,2015-10-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Totally shocking.Indian call centre staff make promises  and don't follow up (calls  replacement routers etc)U.K. Call centre no better.Problem was only solved by talking to the cancellation dept  explaining all the lies and errors  and being put through to someone who had the ability to make a decision and not read off a script.I'm.moving soon  and I won't be using BT for my broadband at the new address.~~~,Northamptonshire~~~,2015-10-28~~~,1,1,2,1
I'm actually in the same boat as the others customers with their reviews!!! This is a major mistake I made getting BT ... TV  Phone  Broadband... I got it all. I'm still waiting to get my Phone and broadband to get fixed. It's been a week! I had an engineer calling me asking me how long I have been with out broadband... He then tells my wife that someone had changed my phone connection into someone else's in those green boxes you see on the road. Ok  so I thought yeah  that's fixed. Got home nothing!!!!

Joined bt from sky in august since then it has been regret after regret. I am paying for 37 MBS and am only getting 3 after a fault occurred just after I joined. I have spent the last 7 week trying to get bt to fix the problem. They keep making promises that the problem s will be fixed and keep letting me down. One problem is the line makes calls without our knowledge which I am being billed for and they say I won't get a refund until all problems are solved. In short if you want to throw your money at a bunch of incompetent tossers then bt is for you.  Bt are a descrace to the British name~~~,Cumbria~~~,2015-10-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I initiated a home process  so far so good.An issue with trying to get BT infinity in my new home  even though the BT online checker said it was available. This was due to it being a new build and it needing a new phone line. I was told by the home move team once the service was installed they would review line speed and upgrade to infinity free of charge. Good so far.Open reach turn up to the house to install the service (phone and BB) and line. To be told that i need a specialist to to the work - this even though they knew it was a new house. The builder had run a duct to the pole. Apparently it is a specialist job to do this. I'm then told it needs a sight survey and its 5 days before BT get date for this from openreach. I'm also told this was now being case managed. This is BT speak for - no one else in BT can talk to you about this and you can not get direct contact with the case management team. I assume this is a way of avoiding getting calls for frustrated customers.Finally get the work done for engineer to say the original guy could have done this and was being a lazy so and so.I now find my online bill is charging me for services for certain dates that i have not had.Tried contacting BT about this  and guess what it is still with escalation team and they cannot contact them or raise it with them and I have to wait 5 days for the review date to come around before I get a call - if i ever do - as this has never happened yet.What a great way for you to be managed and have no one resolve this as you can not get in touch with this team.Time to move me thinks~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2015-10-28~~~,1,1,3,3
Very bad and  customer service don't know well their products. They give different information at every phone call. Website upgrades are not clear. Same bad as sky ..~~~,London~~~,2015-10-28~~~,1,2,3,3
For the last 5 years I have experienced terrible  shocking service from BT as a company. I wouldn't mind so much if their product was decent but it's nothing short of garbage. It is 2015 and we shouldn't have to put up with painfully slow broadband  it's embarrassing! So we pay for 10mb download and receive less that 1.8 - how is that acceptable.I can honestly say that Virgin was a lot better. BT know they have no competition so treat their customers like rubbish because they have the monopoly and just DO NOT CARE about me or you!My advice is go to the top and bypass these people who act as customer service agents. By the way BT  my name is NOT Mr Paul. That's my first name.If you recruit and use cheap labor then please educate them to the standard we require in the UK for communication purposes.Why are BT being allowed to take over? They have now acquired EE mobile so anyone using that provider expect the same level of crap service and arrogance. Massive profits for a substandard product - woeful BT.~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2015-10-28~~~,1,1,1,1
On my activation day  I had no telephone or internet service (and I had it the day before). After calling them everyday for a week  I then got the telephone working (I had been calling them via my mobile). I have been calling them almost every other day for a month  but I have had no luck getting the internet sorted. They first stated that if they are called out and the problem with the phone line is due to something I have done  they will fine me £129.99! Then they sent out two engineers (of course I had to stay home off work for these visits) who could not fix the problem. And then they just kept on saying over the phone that they will get some other engineers to go and fix the network and wiring at the cabinet on the street. They promised me (for the 5th time) that yesterday it would all be sorted. However it is not. Hence I am cancelling my contract and moving to another company! So much time wasted on these incompetent people! Also  I have waster £100 on a 3G dongle for slow internet in the mean time.~~~,Carmarthen~~~,2015-10-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Shocking customer service  after waiting 2 weeks for connection  wasted a day waiting for someone to connect my line but no one turned up  found out order has not been processed  told in 2 days I shall receive a phone call which never came and when I called them about it was hung up on whilst being on hold. Needed to call them multiple times to get to the bottom of the fact that I cannot get fibre broadband at my address  so just upgraded with existing service provider. Shameful  utter rubbish and wasted over a month of my time. Toby~~~,Barnet~~~,2015-10-27~~~,1,1,1,1
"BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE choosing BT. First they send my equipment to the wrong address. After calling them they say sorry (they say that a lot) we are going to send you your aeuipment again. One hour later I get a message telling me ""we are sorry that you cancelled your order  please return the equipment back to us"". Call them again and said I did not cancel anything and I don't have any equipment to return because you send it to the wrong address. They said sorry (again) ignore the message. After the engineer comes to install my phone and a couple of days later they text me that my broadband is activated. Activated but not working. After numerous phonecalls and three cancelled BT engineer appointments an engineer comes and tells me that not only I've been given a wrong phone number but a wrong broadband too. Apparently although I order and paying for Fiber broadband I didn't get one. My speeds are 1.5mbs Max! Basically my order is all screwed up. That's what happens when you speak with people in India that can barely speak any English. BT worse company in the UK. NEVER AGAIN~~~",Manchester~~~,2015-10-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst company I have ever experienced! Was due to switch from BT to TalkTalk on 9th September but BT wouldn't pass on the information they required which they have openly admitted and also said should I wish to change I would need to change my phone number. Ater numerous conversations I was told no payment would be requested from 9th-28th September and the Direct Debit was cancelled by them before 9th September. I have now been billed £148.94 plus £10.00 charge for failure of payment via Direct Debit  after they cancelled it! Customer Services staff are rude and don't pay attention to what you're saying  manager's seem to interrupt you whilst you're talking and then go quiet when you've pointed out a fact that they can't argue. Absolutely diabolicle  worst company I have EVER come into contact with  cannot wait to get rid of this terrible Broadband that hardly ever works. Definitely would not recommend for anyone to switch over to them.~~~,Doncaster~~~,2015-10-27~~~,1,1,1,1
As a customer of Talktalk  hit by a price increase and then the security scare  when I received a well judged mailshot from BT  I was tempted. I went on to their chat on line spot and told them the details of my current arrangement and asked for a quote.The reply was that the limit of 250 characters had been exceeded  and invited me to start again.My first reaction was annoyance that I had not been warned that there was a limit until I had painstakingly typed my request.Then I felt relief. It all came back to me why I had left them in the first place so many years ago. it was their arrogance  treating customers as just cash cows.So thanks BT. No saving is worth getting back into bed with you!!!y  h~~~,Tal y waun Torfaen~~~,2015-10-26~~~,1,1,1,1
