Got but hub5 and i can't get broadband speed on wireless connection with wire it shows 45Mbps and on wireless it goes down to 0.19Mbps~~~,Batley~~~,2016-08-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst broadband company ever  low speed (said to be 17 and I only received 3)   disconnecting very frequently like every day  no point using it all...  well it did call u back when u make a complaint  but then I kept being told that they'll ask someone to check to and get back to me  engineer appointment not available over weekend  and I tried to book it like 2 weeks later  and they said it's too early so can't book it for me?! Seriously?!~~~,Stretford~~~,2016-08-04~~~,1,1,1,1
They are not good at all we moved on the 6th of july and they have put us off untill the 4th of august we then get a message saying we have to wait untill the 8th of october because apperently there is no line connecting even though our neighbours both have bt and there is a bt phone line in the kitchen but it has been switched off.We got told to wait in on the 16th of july and we never had anyone turn up because apparently there was a problem at the box but we where never nottified so was waiting in until 6PM.so they are bad in all areas as they just dont do anything and are in no rush to help anyone with poor customer service~~~,Cornwall~~~,2016-08-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Unfortunately  the terrible practices BT uses to extract a maximum amount of money possible are industry standard at this point  that however doesn't excuse them. I've been trying to cancel my service for about 2 months now since I moved out of the house at the end of June. The online interface doesn't recognize my new address  and doesn't let me simply cancel without giving a new address. I've since called multiple times  been stuck in queues for hours  and still haven't managed to cancel my service. Over the 2 months I've been trying to cancel my service  I'm still being charged  and not paying leads to them blocking me from cancelling the service.~~~,Canterbury~~~,2016-08-04~~~,2,1,2,1
To cut a very long story short. AVOID BT AT ALL COST. They have cost me two weeks with no broadband and £2800 in business sales lost.Customer services are rude arrogant and pass you around like a hot piece of coal.~~~,Wales~~~,2016-08-04~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I am absolutely dissgussed at bt customer service. Without notifying me they raised my bill when I was told when I signed up over the phone I was in a fixed rate for 12 months. I wanted to cancel my package and the Asian man I spoke to put me on hold half way through conversation at 20:50 for over 25 minutes... the reason being... they close at 21:00 and clearly didn't want to take the call! I used to work for bt for over 2 years and I know all the tricks they use! This is an absolute disgrace and the power of social media is a wonderful thing. I will be cancelling with amedeat effect! Bt instead of paying your paying your employees shifty bonuses to answer phones try getting to learn how to do the actual job... I wounder if you are regulated by the FCA?? DON'T CHOOSE BT!!!~~~,Warrington~~~,2016-08-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Appalling service - Broadband is slow and drops out all the time  sometimes it just disappears completely for hours at a time. On top of this BT have just put their prices up by 20% 3 months into a 12 month contract. I am unable to cancel the contract as they notified my via email. Unfortunately I missed it as it got lost in all the millions of marketing emails they send me so this is my fault technically. Customer service is appalling  long waits on the phone  aggressive and unhelpful staff. Cancellation fee to end contract is more than the remainder of the contract will actually cost me if I stay with them. This short term attitude will lose them customers long term as I will just wait until the cancellation fee is under £100 and switch to sky who will pay this amount back to me for switching.  Terrible all round service  would not recommend BT to my worst enemy.~~~,Cardiff~~~,2016-08-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Fast but expensive and full of contract loopholes to cost you more. AVOID.  BT Infinity is not unlimited  it has a limit of 20GB per month which is not enough for general use. Upgrading after the contract costs twice what a new customer would be offered. The TV service is not worth the money as offers no extra channels to regular freeview.~~~,Warwickshire~~~,2016-08-03~~~,1,1,4,3
Broadband regularly goes down. I spend hours in 'live chat' or on the phone. Their call centre overseas has no ability other than to log a problem and often don't understand enough English to do so.Their record keeping is abysmal. i'm still being chased for an account I had fifteen years ago  before I moved to TalkTalk and then back to BT three years ago. In any other industry this company would be closed down.~~~,Staines~~~,2016-08-02~~~,1,1,2,2
E mail is connected through my BT account. No access to it today. Account suspended. Talked to 3 different people in India and hours on hold. more than 2.5 hours attempting to make sense. They can't fix it and say someone will call me on Tuesday     have a great evening. Utterly utterly useless company with no idea of customer service~~~,Ayr~~~,2016-07-30~~~,1,1,3,1
The WORST customer service experience ever. If you go with BT be prepared to spend hours over days to get issues resolved.~~~,Bristol~~~,2016-07-29~~~,1,1,2,2
"Worst company I've ever came across. The customer service is atrocious!! Ordered my new broadband package on 2/07/16  was told the kit would arrive on 15th and service would be activated on 18th. No kit arrived. Tried live chat numerous times   these people pass you about as no one can actually help on here. Was told to ring. Called and was told a new kit would be posted - they posted a replacement hub only  not the full starter kit so was no use To me at all. Rang again 27/07/16 - was told a new set of cables for The hub would be sent out and arrive Today or tomorrow. They are crediting me £11 as a ""goodwill gesture"" for the time I haven't received the service. So basically they have no customer service skills and paying me £11 back of my own money as I haven't been able to use the service - never again will I use them or recommend to anyone.~~~",N.Ireland~~~,2016-07-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Overall unsatisfactory the service with  Bt!Definite not recommend to my family's and friends! And can't see any future business with Bt!~~~,Portishead ~~~,2016-07-28~~~,1,1,3,3
this is hands down the worst company I have EVER dealt with. painful experience and a time wasting bunch of idiots. the staff knew nothing and managers promised things and never provided them. I have been dealing with these idiots for 8 weeks now and I would rather die then deal with them. would never recommend them to anyone even if they happened to be by some miracle the last company to potentially provide a service. I have had money stolen out of my account  promised re payment and never received the payment. all calls are recorded and they have their managers and front staff promising a service and not delivering. an absolute joke of a so called British Telecoms company and I spoke with hardly anyone from England who could understand the situation.~~~,London~~~,2016-07-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely dreadful company. Broadband is fast when it works but if you have a fault it will take a week to fix then you will never hear back from anyone at BT. I have been trying for 4 weeks to get in touch with them and no one is responding. Full of rage and leaving for Virgin.~~~,London~~~,2016-07-27~~~,~~~,~~~,5,3
"I have been a BT customer for over 10 years (service was okay - not brilliant). It is only today that I had enough.I will have to pay to have a new router and Freeview box (had them for 5 years now) - new customers get them free.Its not bad enough that we don't get the same great rates as new customers (my broadband was £20.00/month more expensive than new customers  and that when you do get a better deal they increase the price 1 month into the new contract. Having contacted them I was told they sent me an email 2 months ago announcing their increases (this email I never received - ""must have gone to junkmail""). So I lost out on my free cancellation period.Now I have been told I have to pay £270 to cancel my contract.I find this whole matter galling - so I will stick out my contract - but will NEVER EVER again be using BT. Looking into changing the service at work as well. Lets see how much they want to charge for that.~~~",London~~~,2016-07-27~~~,1,1,3,3
I joined bt over a year ago just for the £75 gift card.I wasnt allowed the gift card as they said i didnt qualify for one although i applied for bt on line.Through the time i was with bt my broadband was slow kept dropping and the prices flutuated.I never had any of these problems with my previous supplier(sky).i am now with the post office so bt and stick their broadband.~~~,worcester~~~,2016-07-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Nil Stars. Utter  utter crap. So slow we can't download music  watch catchup TV  or surf the web without interruption. Advised that we should not use wifi but ethernet!!! Livid. Been totally screwed by BT. Only one computer on at anyone time in our house and even then it fails. Grrrrrrr! Totally rubbish customer service. Signed up to a contract and feel totally trapped.~~~,Taunton~~~,2016-07-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Thought I would try BT infinity got the bub and set up so it worked even though the signal strength wasn't as good as with just the old hub.I find it keeps crashing with no signal. Tried diagnostics all the things recommended and still it keeps crashing phoned for technical help and after 30 minutes was told there was a fault at there end and a man was working on it and to wait for four hours or so. I explained that this fault was not just a one day problem but has been ongoing for months only to be told to wait 4 hours and call back. If that is service its no wonder this country is in the mess its in.~~~,Horncastle~~~,2016-07-26~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst broadband I ever used ! Extremely slow  very slow response (no surprise - line are engaged for hours as so many people are experiencing problems)Will switch as soon as I can~~~,london~~~,2016-07-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling!!! Seem to be the only option where I live. 30 minutes waiting for helpline (which is in India)  then they do not know what they are talking about. Just read it from a script. I took out a package at £23 a month  14 months later this has increased to £47 a month and no improvement in service. I get 7.6 Mb/s (their UP TO 17). Total rip off.  DO NOT USE BT.~~~,Dumfries and Galloway~~~,2016-07-26~~~,1,1,1,2
Terrible service  speed is slow and God help you if you want to run two devices off your router  3G on my iPhone 5 is quicker  enquires about reducing my package to match my speed and they gave me lame excuses as to why it wasn't possible  if you need to google something go to a book shop  it would be quicker than using bt~~~,Northern Ireland~~~,2016-07-25~~~,1,1,1,1
We have had the unlimited BT broadband infinity for just over a year now. It is extortionately over priced  we now pay £50 per month for internet that is extremely temperamental. I am constantly seeing better deals online being offered for NEW customers  but for myself who has been paying them for over a year now cannot get any of these deals  nor do they care if you say you are unhappy with it and that you want to leave.I was receiving no internet for a few days and found it extremely hard to get through to the right people  and even the hold ring tone gives you no indication of how long you will be waiting on the phone  at some points the phone cut off and i had to ring back again.When trying to deal with the fault with our internet and finally getting through to their faults team  they were totally un-personal and just read from a script rather then listening to me  and to top it off when i asked if i could get some of my money back as i was paying for a service i wasn't receiving i was hung up on.  I've never been so unhappy with a company before and as soon as we move home in the next few months  will be going with another provider.~~~,milton keynes~~~,2016-07-25~~~,1,1,2,2

I've been with BT for as long I've had a phone/broadband  I've finally had enough and I'm switching to another company. The final straw was being charged £129 by BT for a visit by an engineer. The phone line was struck by lightning  the hub blew  and I had to replace the phone. The engineer knew that it was lightning to the line that had caused it  we discussed it at length  yet his report didn't mention a thing about it. Spoke to endless BT staff and have been told that it was our fault and we have to pay the charge. Countless times over the years the phone or internet have not been working  we've never once had a penny knocked off our bill. They once took 6 weeks to come out and look at the fault. I am tired of the call-centre staff being overseas  I'm tired of the endless options when phoning them - press 1 to speak to an idiot  press 2 to speak to a lesser idiot. I'm tired of their ineptitude  broken promises  and lack of customer service. They are too large and unwieldy  they don't care about individual customers  they have too much of a monopoly  particularly as they own Openreach. I hope that the company we are in the process of switching to will be a breath of fresh air - they already score points for staff being in the UK  being smaller and friendlier (we're moving to Zen  they have really good reviews). Between the phone  broadband  and BT Vision we spent on average £50 per month  may BT enjoy their pyrrhic victory  they made us pay the £129 charge but they have lost £600 a year in payments.~~~,Ceredigion~~~,2016-07-24~~~,1,1,2,2

I have had interrupted broadband and limited service broadband for almost a week now. Prices went up and I started a new contract three months ago.I keep having to reset hub several times a day. This is hopeless.~~~,Somerset~~~,2016-07-24~~~,1,1,1,1
AN expensive mistake on my part to take on what quickly proved to be very unreliable broadband. Same old BT arrogance - 'we know best  ignore the customer  buy the new router'. I can't wait for contract to  end so I can put them out of my misery.~~~,Southend~~~,2016-07-24~~~,1,1,2,1
BT telecommunications have possibly got the worst customer service team that I've ever spoke too. Firstly had a great service for two years  even without fibre the connection was excellent. Gradually the monthly bill crept up and then it came too moving house. We informed BT that we were moving and gave the correct details   all sorted.great no worries. Wrong we received a letter of confirmation on the date it would be switched on and a email. The day came didnt realise how much I would miss wi fi  mobile data sucks. No connection so we waited a day and nothing. So I rang BT and after 40 minutes of being on hold I got through to a lovely gentleman in a call centre   who could barely speak English and after ten minutes just to relay my postcode it was not going well. After a further 20 minutes off frustrating conversation  which lead nowhere he decided too try and tell me that someone had cancelled the order and gave me the number it was cancelled off. The number he gave was my phone number and said it would take a further two weeks to connect us . Absolute joke and a complete mockery of the word customer service. I'm sure if I was a new customer I would have got a much better service. Now with talktalk  cheaper  more channels and didn't take two weeks  Rant over~~~,Glossop~~~,2016-07-22~~~,1,1,1,1

I have needed to cancel my contract  and I am currently trying to do this. It's still a couple of days into my cooling off period and I am well within my rights.  I've been trying since last night to cancel. It was quite easy to set up with bt  and was told if I  changed my mind it would be easy to leave so long as it was within 14days of starting. Well I'm trying now and finding it near impossible.  What is not acceptable is internet providers thinking they can inconvenience you out of not cancelling. The best way to keep customers is by good customer service and good products. Get that right  people stay longer  refer others and you make more revenue. Trying to stop people cancelling by making it sp hard is ridiculous.~~~,Acton~~~,2016-07-22~~~,1,1,1,1
No other choice than BT and the speeds and relaibility are appalling...promises of a better and faster service never materialise....Trying to run a business using a broadband connection in DT11 8JN is impossible !!!!~~~,dt11 8jn~~~,2016-07-22~~~,1,1,1,1
If you are considering joining BT then don't.  Signed a 2 year contract in October  no internet for over 2 weeks  insisted we had internet  sent 2 Openreach engineers who both said  you're   right you don't have internet.  They eventually fixed it but had to give us a new 'contract' this happened 4 times.  They took money on all accounts so we payed them over £370 too much  we are still arguing with them.  Today they tell us they are putting their charges up !!!  So  what was the point in signing a contract.  Utterly scandalous company.~~~,Salford~~~,2016-07-21~~~,1,1,1,1
"Just HAD to come and add my review to the pile of negative comments that get posted here due to the service BT gives. Here we pay for 30MB/s download and are on BT's buisness fibre optic deal. I am HUGE tech geek so i know when somethings up. We constantly get sh*t on from a height from bt with extremely slow services (at one weekend download went down to 0.4MB/S!!!) and constant connection interruptions. We haven't had a week go by that we have a constant connection. The 'broadband' sign on the router is always orange or non-existent when the  connection drops. The only times we have had what we pay for seems to be ridiculously early in the morning and for a week after we phone them to complain. We have sent an email covering all the bases they seem to constantly say ""this can have an effect"" like hardware bottle necks. Getting us to go ONLY on certain sites to check the speed which we are sure are exaggerating our network speeds. Bt are THE WORST ISP out there and I highly recommend looking elsewhere. Possibly someone that can withhold their end of a contract that they sign you into because it is most likely that after your contract ends you have had enough of their bullsh*t and decide to go to a worth ISP of your money. I feel the need to say this so that maybe one less person is screwed over by bt and one day (hopefully) the company ends up where it deserves to be. In the dirt. TLDR: DON'T EVER SIGN WITH BT THEY WILL F*CK YOU OVER.~~~",Surrey~~~,2016-07-21~~~,1,1,1,1

We are now on our 4th BT Router! The speed is poor (1 MB/second)but worse is the Broadband service keeps dropping out. There was a public meeting with BT in the village hall at which BT said that a fibre link to the exchange could be installed. This would however need match funding i.e. if BT's cost was £30 000 the village would need to find £15 000 of that. All for a service which they should be providing in the first place. OFCOM should regulate the cost i.e. based on line speed  20M/s = £12/month then 1Mb/s = £0.60/month. Not one price fits all  this would focus BT on improving their service.~~~,Devon~~~,2016-07-21~~~,1,2,1,~~~

Here we go for an epic list of failure from BT broadband. For 4 years there is ongoing work due to Infinity upgrades in my area (it like 70's Eastern bloc technology) and every time work is done near my home lose broadband and/or phone line. First time as hadn't a mobile told me they'd call to arrange a repair on broken landline - yes thatwas their solution  get repair done three months later same again and next repair this happens again and again one engineer advised buy a new hub router which I do. Next one advises me cabinet is not fit for purpose at my housing estate and best to pass on Infinity as will be years before it actually works to fullest capacity.So around a year on same happens again Kelly Communication engineers are working across street from my house and lose broadband again in this time three engineers tell me with an engineering degree they have broken a cable joint each time. At this customer services assure me will never happen again. On 13/7/16 drop out is not resolved so start a webchat but difficult via my phone so don't get a resolution then away at work for a few days and call 17/7/16 advise of previous issues and begin a complaint so given a date of 20/7/16 for repair causing me untold hassle to re-arrange my diary but do so. On morning pf 20/7/16 re-read SMS sent to confirm this discussion/appointment it quotes 13/7/16 the week before and I reported this on 17/7/16! So after an hour two handlers agree this will  not happen however their manager tells me I'm due for repair in next hour. Hour passes by and no engineer so another call and webchat which at this time advised I livei rural Scotland I dont 6 miles from largest city Glasgow seemingly it was a logistics issue for rural living which I do not have add can see two engineers vans along road so there are engineers in area- no their not well I can see them call ends with being told can't help anymore as will not accept lies and additional five day wait. BT customer services are from the goon platoon tell you anything get called out as liars with proof each time and they rudely hang up as you tell them politely as I don't shout or swear at them as too tired of this now. BT your worse than pathetic and now leaving to get a pigeon its more reliable than your service.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,1,1,1
1.3mbps to 1.6mps We have bought new house over two years agoWe were promised to have fibre optics soon  but I dont know what it means soon in BT language  probably whenever.2016 and they are still building houses with those crap copper cables...Average speed in Vietnam is 1 8mbps!!We all here(not just me) have this issue.~~~,Bridgwater~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,1,1,1
