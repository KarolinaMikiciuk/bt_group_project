Having switched to BT Infinity from Orange standard broadband  I have seen no discernible improvement. Just before writing this review  I experienced two pauses while watching iPlayer via the Infinity hub. On a few occasions   my desktop has lost the connection. Perhaps if there were several people in the house all sharing the hub  it might come into its own. I have several months of my contract to run so performance over the remaining period will determine whether or not I feel it is worth the extra money. At the moment I reserve judgement.~~~,Reading~~~,2016-11-11~~~,3,3,3,3
Phoned up to report a phone fault. Got called a rude sod by the person at BT when I wasn't happy they weren't going to do anything about it!!~~~,Mansfield~~~,2016-11-10~~~,4,1,5,5
Absolutely terrible service which is matched only by their terrible customer service department in India who cannot speak/write English  cannot wait until my contract ends. Will be leaving and not returning!~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2016-11-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Switched over to bt and the wifi is terrible. It picks it up on devices for only a matter of seconds before disconnecting and re-connecting. Avoid as they dont provide you with the services you pay for but continue to charge full price for every month.~~~,Devon~~~,2016-11-09~~~,1,2,1,1
The worst customer service that I have ever experienced.I was with BT for about a year  I canceled my contract early because I was moving to another country. I was told that it would cost £74 to cancel my contract early but they ended up charging well over £100. They also overcharged me for several of the months that I was with them. When I was eventually able to get in touch  they kept avoiding my questions about the charges. I emptied my bank account so that they can not take any more money from me  since then they have reported me to a debt collection agency.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2016-11-09~~~,2,1,4,2
left taliktalk and joined BT phone and broadband service 14 months ago   what a big mistake   phone service was ok but broadband was poor   I got a normal broadband speed of 8 mbs from talktalk but only about 4 mbs from BT   but it was cheaper than talktalk so I live with it   but after a few months BT put the price up steadly   and the contract has ended I rejoined talktalk because last couple  months BT has almost DOUBLE the amount I have to paid from £38 to £63 per month and also wanted £ 31 for the disconnection from BT .BT also said because talk talk did not inform them about the switch over so my account was still active   althought I did use their service I still have to pay 3 months rental charge.  BT are conman wanted the steal you money   once joined your have to paid a lot more to get out. SO you have been warned .M CHAN from London~~~,London~~~,2016-11-08~~~,1,1,1,1
For 6 months I have had issues with my broadband dropping out and wifi being unable to stream videos.  Have wasted hours of my life on the phone to BT but cannot get by the call centre who are hopeless and keep telling me they have remotely solved the problem  then the same thing happens again.  When it works it is fine but the gauge of a company  is how they respond to problems and BT have sadly failed.~~~,Ayr~~~,2016-11-07~~~,2,1,2,1
just to saythey offer vouchers that never come i was meant to get 2 sainsbury vouchers never happened!!! try to call them or respond plain ignorance rest assured i will never sign up with them again  not for the service but fraudulent advertisement!!!!~~~,newham~~~,2016-11-07~~~,3,1,3,4
We upgraded to BT Infinity  but its no better than the ordinary broadband service we had previously.  It provides a maximum speed of 21 Gps.  This is fast enough in theory  but is insufficient to sustain for some TV programs  leaving us to watch a rotating circle instead.  Very disappointing.~~~,Stoke Gabriel~~~,2016-11-07~~~,2,2,3,2
Signed up in August 2016 to get fibre and phone on 28th September.  Failed to install on that date but cancelled my existing service provider.  Phone taken over with no broadband.  Still have no fibre as of 6th November.  Customer services are a disgrace and tell untruths.  Sick of waiting for hours to be connected to customer services who then seem incapable of offering any meaningful resolution.  Avoid at all costs as the company is in free fall.  Taking on more business that they can reasonably fulfill.~~~,Ilkley~~~,2016-11-06~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Went back to BT for the broadband and infinity wish I had stayed with talktalk. The router has no range unless it's a day old then quite good but as soon as that day is over kiss you're wireless goodbye the router might reach 3 mars bar lengths but that's about it would not recommend no customer service at all BT is a joke stay well clear~~~,Co durham~~~,2016-11-06~~~,1,1,1,1
New HH6 delivered before activation turned it on the day of activation connected straight away.Full 52MB speeds right from the off.No problems at all it just works.~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2016-11-06~~~,5,5,5,5
My activation date was supposed to be 21/10. It did not activate and the BT home hub arrived 22/10. I contacted them several times to find out why my service had not been activated. They raised a complaint for me and someone called me the next day to tell me that my services would not activate until the week after  but they'll contact me the next day to give me an update about whether they could do that sooner for me. They called me the following day  but hung up after two seconds so I could not pick up. This happened the following day too  so I contacted their online chat and was told that my services would activate in 24 hours. It did not. I contacted their online chat again and was told it would definitely activate by 3/11. Needless to say  I contacted them on the day to make sure. The lady on the phone was called Sonia. It was lucky I called as was told if I hadn't it was unlikely anything would have been done that day either. She escalated my complaint for me and made sure they activated my phone line for me that day. The broadband activated the following day. I would really like to thank Sonia as without her  I would probably still be without phone or broadband. BT is the first provider I have ever had problems with. They never communicated any problems or delays to me which would have made things better. At least I would have known what was going on. Instead  I had to chase them every step of the way to find out what was happening with my order.  I did not like that they would call me for two seconds and hang up before I could pick up just so that they can put down that they tried to call me but could not. I did not like that they kept giving me a date then changing it further and further into the future. There are some very dishonest people working there  letting down the company and the people who actually work hard there. BT comes across as a very disorganised company to me. Their broadband seems OK right now  but I am dreading having any problems in the future and having to contact their customer service. From my personal experience with them  I cannot recommend signing up for BT phone and broadband.~~~,London~~~,2016-11-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I moved my busines to BT from a previous supplier but its the same lines anyway.  BT are the most terrible company anyone can imagine.  They dont know who we are  we have no customer number  we cannot log faults without it  we have nothing what we ordered and despite many emails to them and calls our phones and internet are on and off constantly. They even left my old number behind although  many times I told them this was to be included. Despite emails from BT for our new system saying an engineer will arrive to set us and and hsow us how it all works we have never seen an engineer !! and we dont work.  I should have checked the reviews before  moving.  But then the other providers out source to BT anyway.  So a hopeless situation.  BE WARNED. Keep to a mobile if your not a business and keep well away from BT if you are.  They are too big to cope and most departments dont even ANSWER THE PHONE. If your lucky enough for them to answer dont expect any continuation of a conversation even if you have that persons number to call them back.~~~,London~~~,2016-11-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Switched from Sky to BT due to their claims of having the fastest speeds in the UK... Since then  the connection drops out completely around twice per week for no apparent reason... Leaves us with no Internet for hours at a time. The speeds are OK during the day (I work from home)  but as soon as it hits 4pm they die a death. I'm writing this at 5.11pm and a speed test tells me I'm receiving 5mb/s when I pay for 50. Would not recommend them. Customer services operation is based abroad which I wouldn't care about if I could get through to someone quickly  unfortunately you'll be on hold for 30mins at a time to get through. Can't wait for my contract to end.~~~,"Nottingham, UK~~~",2016-11-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Horrendous  bt are crooks   lie after lie  asked to speak with a manager the same lady called me back on another number pretending to be a manager and when I caught her out she put the phone down!!!Spoke to graham taylor who is high up in complaints apparently and he was just as horrendous  although for the poor customer service he allowed £10 off our bill as a good will gesture   how kind of him when we don't believe we actually owed any more money anyway !!!! Stay clear of this company~~~,Norwich~~~,2016-11-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I've been with BT Internet for over a decade and BT as a landline for 30+ years.. Never had an issue and always sang their praises to all my friends  etc... But when they sent me the hub5  they asked me to return the hub3 to them for recycling  which I then did. But after about 3 months orso  the hub started doing random things  such as switching off randomly and more than anything  giving me the worst wifi signal ever. So I called BT and said here must be a fault with my service. So they ran tests  I checked all my settings and everything from my side was all ok  so they sent me another hub5 and I sent the old one back.. I received the new hub5  but pretty much had wifi issues since day1. I can't get signal in the next room and it's a normal house with normal walls I live in. If I'm on my phone and walk to the kitchen  the signal drops and I'm stuck on 4g. I thought it might be my phone  but it's doing the same on my wife's phone and my work mobile  all 3 mobiles are on different providers. My laptop and tablet do the same  they drop signal if I move away from the room where the router is. I again checked everything in my house  but I don't have any interferences  as I don't have a wireless landline  I don't have any blockers anywhere near my rooms. Ie microwave or special remote controls etc.. So I bought a BT wifi extender for the other side of my house  but it never gets connection as it just cannot find the router at all  I know if works as it works fine when plugged into the main room with the router So I contacted BT and told the hub5 they sent me also doesn't work and I asked if they can just not send me the hub6  as my friends use it and they (and me when I visit) have amazing signal even long into their garden. BT then literally told me they won't do anything as I should not be using wifi enabled items as they will never offer assistance with wifi  the lady even told me that their adverts are rubbish and lie (I recorded the call!!!) So I said could they send me he hub6 because all the issues I've had and I've been with them for such a long time and they said  not a chance. If I wanted it  I could buy it but they wouldn't help me (their actual words) So I feel disgusted by their services and just plain rudeness of their staff.. I'm still contracted with them for another 5 months  but really don't want to keep paying for a service I cannot use as its **bleep** and a drain on my money and resources in the house. I would get another router  but BT have made it so difficult for this to happen  as they lock a lot of features to prevent this. I know it's only the Internet  but I make my living from it and cannot do my job correctly without it and it's stressing me out  I've already lost a customer because of lack of service.. I've been able to test a friends Hub6 while they were on holiday and the signal was amazing. Throughout my house and into my garden. So this proves that the issue is 100% the Hub5 and not my house or area itself. But BT are basicly calling me liar and do not care about us at all.. My contract doesn't finish until the 5th of April so I have to endur this rubbish for a while yet.. I have raised a claim with the ombudsman for help  as it's ridiculous..! I'm so unhappy with BT~~~,Taunton~~~,2016-11-03~~~,1,1,1,1
If you're looking to sign up to BT Infinity  don't waste your time or money. It is absolutely shocking how poor the connections actually are. I get better results from my mobile data which is pretty shabby in itself. All the new customer deals that they keep chucking out there seem very tempting but save yourself the soul crushing frustration and run  run far away from the decision to enter into a contract which the devil himself must have drawn up because being tied to BT is purely torturous. I can honestly say  dial up was better!If I could give 0 stars  I would~~~,Kent~~~,2016-11-01~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Avoid BT like the plague and certainly DO NOT upgrade to infinity. This is the first time I have been compelled to write  review. I am shocked and deeply concerned by the number of bad reviews BT are receiving at the moment - it doesn't give me hope my problems are going to be solved anytime soon. We were on the dial-up broadband for 18months  then decided to upgrade to infinity 1 with a special extra £1 offer. HOWEVER i wish i could turn back the clock and return to my old hub and package. We never had any problems before  speeds were ok and it never lost connection. INFINITY 1 has been problems from day one. Speeds are shocklingly bad it is constantly throwing us off. The first month the speeds never got past 4mbps  and were 0.2mbps past 7pm at night. I complained and they found a fault with the exchange. The speeds improved temporarily and could reach 25-30mbps (should be getting at least 46mbps mind!!)However 3 weeks on it is repeatly disconnecting us. We are forever restarting the hub or disconnecting /reconnecting to the wifi on the laptop. Just done a speed test and it was 8mbps! (8.05pm at night) It is so frustrating. The customer service is pretty shocking too - and it takes 10mins just to find a contact number on their website in the first instance. If you are not a bT customer - do not become one!!~~~,Bury St Edmunds~~~,2016-11-01~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"I never normally leave reviews but thought I must this time to warn everyone DO NOT BUY BT BROADBAND OR TV I have never dealt with people that are so uneducated and basically do not have a clue what products they sell. Broadband has not work properly since we have had it installed  they tell you that you have a 14 day 'cooling off period' where you can cancel your package if you are not happy what they do not tell you is that this 14 days starts from when you place your order so in my case it took them 3 weeks for an engineer to come out and get it all set up on which case my right to cancel no longer exhausts and want £900 to get me out of my 12 month contact. After spending hours and hours getting through to someone on their customer services department I get through to India where they are reading from a screen and don't understand your problem - ""computer says NOOOOO"" I actually emailed them and now have a dedicated person who likes to call every week ""to see how we are getting on"" but not actually solving our problem""They have determined that my broadband doesn't work correctly because of where the engineer has set it up - basically on my tv stand. They have said connection problems is our fault and nothing they can do - but the broadband needs to be by our tv as it needs to be connected to our youview box funny how SKY do not have the same problems as BT. But don't worry they are refunding me £11.60 as a good will gesture! My direct debit is now cancelled see how far they can take it for me to pay my bill when they have falsely advertised their services and have not resolved my problem If you buy something from the shop that is broken you expect a full refund something BT do not understand!!!~~~",West Midlands~~~,2016-11-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Money grabbing is all they are good for. Poor speed  connection always disconnecting and tv programs buffer due to premium programs coming through the internet at poor speeds. To top it off when my contract finished and told them I was going to virgin they charged a fee of £31 to disconnect my broadband. Avoid at all costs. Even the money they give out for joining doesn't turn up.~~~,Birmingham ~~~,2016-11-01~~~,1,2,1,1
The worst customer service imaginable.  It started with them sending the engineer round to install the broadband and TV on the wrong date on 3 separate occasions. When they finally got the date correct the engineer wasn't given the correct equipment to install the service I had ordered. This was topped off by them charging me for the 3 months between when I put the order in for the service and when it was finally installed and I was able to use it. This is something others I have spoken with have also been a victim of so be aware they should only be charging you for the time in which you have use of the services. Once up and running the internet was slow and this also impacted their TV service as most of this runs off the internet. I was paying for Infinity 2 which they say will be up to 75Mbps and a minimum of 35Mbps in my area  however when I finally got round to testing the speed I was receiving 1Mbps. This has now finally been fixed after a month with many  many calls to their customer service line and two engineer visits  one of which was sent on the wrong day again (luckily I was in on this occasion). The engineers are great and the second one has fixed the problem and it is now working correctly however the people in the call centre never call back when they say they will and when you call them they tell you you have to wait for a call back from the person dealing with your complaint so they just book in another time slot for them not to call you back in again.  Be careful to make a note of any calls you make and any engineer appointments you make and keep it as when I spoke with them about compensation the date they gave for the fault being resolved was 10 days before the engineer had been round to fix the problem. After all of this they said that if I wanted to leave the contract I would have to buy myself out even though they haven't provided the service I had signed up for  I will never be using BT again and I would strongly recommend you consider another provider.~~~,East Sussex~~~,2016-10-31~~~,1,1,1,1
"phoned to cancel old contract. the Sales guy's crib sheet said  new hub  lower cost better service.So like an idiot I accepted.Infinity 2 Broadband.they send me 2 new Smart hubs and 1 new Homehub5 and 3 freeview boxes.maybe this was to commiserate me coz from the day they changed from old to Infinity 2  NO phone line  No broadband.please pay us £130 for an engineer to visit ""in case you have built an extension and disrupted the cable"" Lol. WHAT?3 months later  NO phone line  NO broadband  Many promised return calls from Customer NO shows.The only way I could get ay proper response was to directly e-mail ""gavin.e.patterson@bt.com"" who is the CEO. Try it  I can guarantee you will get a response from his department within hours.Guess what they do? put you in the hands of the same team who crooked you in the first place.Exceptional!~~~",Birmingham~~~,2016-10-31~~~,1,1,1,1
my broadband was connected a month late after having to call them on a daily basis to follow up call backs that never happened  after a month and 15 hrs plus on the phone they managed to fix the issue. a few weeks later i recieved my first bill which should have just been the delivery charge fr the router  instead i was charged £81 (my plan is only meant to be £30) because another mistake that they have made. i am still in the process of chasing my money. After this horrible experience I will be leaving as soon as my contract ends and not coming back.~~~,"Roehampton, London~~~",2016-10-31~~~,1,1,2,1
I wouldn't even give a star for the overall service. I have been with BT since beginning of September. It was the worst mistake going with this provider. I tried to save a little money as SKY was out my price range for the speed i needed. I have the 52 mbs but the actual top speed i can get is 33 mbs (being told this from the BT technician that came to my home) Since my package started i have not had a fully functioning service for longer than 3 days. They still have not fixed my problem as i believe they do not know what it actually is with a technician testing everything within my house i and every thing is fine and working other than the service BT provide. Each time i have phoned BT (around 15 times) no matter the time of the day i have an average wait time of about 40 mins and when i do speak to someone i believe there is a culture clash as there is no empathy or even a generally recognition of social companionship. I have tried to leave the contract due to their speed guarantee but they have fobbed me off with so much and it seems i am stuck in the contract as i can not deal with the extreme hassle of fighting them. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE AND BE WISE~~~,CANTERBURY~~~,2016-10-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst broadband company ever  internet constantly have issues with speed dropping and no service at all sometimes  phone customer service only for them to lie to you and say they will send someone to fix the problem only for no-one to turn up.

Took almost 5weeks to reconnect me to my new house less than 100yards away from my old one  then said they could not find my property only to find they were working on the house next door  soon after my neighbours were disconnected then reconnected with my house phone number!!!!!! The average speed we receive is about 1mb poor customer service due to there English skills.  also poor value for money I still ended up being changed£63 for the month I never even had any internet or tv. Wouldn't recommend to anybody they are a joke and I won't be staying with them! Tryed to charge me saying it was a fault in my property when in actual fact it was poorly connected at the main box  they did nothing to try to resolve the situation and later basically called me a liar saying I had not called as it wasn't on there system worst company I have ever been with!~~~,Cheshire ~~~,2016-10-29~~~,1,1,1,1
A Four Day Customer Please excuse the saracsim  its a healthier way to express my anger than shouting at their dis-interested staff. This is an email I have just sent there complaint department (not holding my breath) Please send this to the relevant manager/ that manager until someone notices how the company operates with a four day customer and can come together with a resolution and a way of insuring this no longer happens with any of your new customers.  Good Afternoon    I decided to become a BT customer regarding BT Infinity Broadband a few weeks ago. My activation date was the 25th October 2016. The day before BT sent me an SMS Message advising me  my service will start tomorrow (25/10/2016) anytime up until midnight.  Upon returning home from work  my BT Home Hub 6 was there and I decided to set it up in case I was already activated. Seeing there was a solid orange light (connection Issue) I thought I would leave it. However I did notice my internet with EE had already finished (as I thought would happen).  Come midnight it was still solid orange  I disconnected the Home Hub  left it 10 minutes  and reconnected it. Unfortunately with the same result (Solid Orange Light). I thought since it was now early hours of the morning I would sleep and see if I was connected in the morning.  When waking on the 26th October it was still Solid Orange  I disconnected the device (including the ADSL) and reconnected after a few minutes  Solid Orange still. Coming back from work it was still solid orange in colour  so I decided to run a diagnostic test via my PC. it advised me after there was a connection issue and to call your service.  After multiple calls (your phone back service doesn't like my mobile number?) and a 36 minute wait I managed to reach an advisor. I explained the above issue and provided my details. they placed me on hold so they could speak to the 'Order Management Team.' I agreed to wait (14 minutes) I spoke to a gentleman (no name provided presumably from order management team) who confirmed my go live date of 25th October 2016 and then asked if he could place me on hold (5 mins). He came back to me to advise he needed to speak to BT Open Reach and asks if I was OK to wait again (3 minutes). He came to advise he was talking to open reach and will call me with 5 to 10 minutes. (Call length 1 hour 17 minutes). He called me back within 3 minutes. The Advisor told me that due to a disagreement between BT (yourselves) and BT Open Reach (a separate contractor now)  no engineer had come to my area at all to connect the internet. As well as this they would not be able to provide me a timescale in which this would be happening and a service could start. We agreed on compensating me for the delivery charge of the home hub (as right now its a plastic box with some lighting and a bunch of wires with no other use)  plus no charges for the days I did not receive the service (understandably I'm not paying for something I am not receiving. We also agreed I would receive a call back the next day between 08:00 and 18:00  as well as notes being added to the account regarding the above issues within your company causing a delay in a new customer receiving a service.  The next day came (27th October 2016)  and I received no phone call. So come 18:10 I called yourselves. I requested a call back (it still does not like my number  so I put down my partners). I received a call back 1 hour later. I spoke to a very helpful gentleman called Corey. I advised him at the beginning of the call I wasn't happy and told him that in a sec I will rant about the service I have received (I surprisingly did not swear). He was OK with this and during my rant could hear him taking notes (made me feel I was being listened too). he advised me he has requested a call back to me by 21:00 that evening but in case they didn't call  supplied a 5 digit text which I could text if I didn't get a call so they could chase this up.  Unfortunately again  I did not receive a call back that night.  The next day 28th October I text Corey's team as advised and I received a call within an hour  the call advisor told me that they have looked into the problem du to an issue with BT Open Reach I was not going to receive my service until at least the 1st November. I advised your college that in the last 48 hours  I have spent 3 hours on the phone  including 1 hour listening to hold music and an automated message (it's worse than what I imagine water torture to be like). and a further 26 hours waiting for a call back (your company name is BT - British Telecoms  and you cant even provide a call back  that's either disgraceful or a serious problem you need to fix). I asked to speak with a manager  the advisor agreed to this and placed me on hold (Again!) whilst on hold (please get more than one song and mix up your automated ladies voice for a bit of variation - maybe Jigsaw from the horror franchise Saw for accuracy reflecting your ability to help your customers) and then they just hung up on me!  I instantly text Corey's team advising all this and received a text to say they are speaking to engineering and would call me within 10 minutes... it took 4 hours and 30 minutes  to receive a text saying a new department would call me within 4/5 days and they had closed my case. naturally I responded asking for a manager from a relevant department to call me and that I was disgusted at the service. I received a call back from a call advisor to tell me they were transferring me to a new department 'connection' department who would transfer me to a manager. when I got through I was told I would now not receive an update until the 2nd November  (within 10 minutes another day had been added!) I asked to speak to a manager and was flat out refused. I then demanded a call back from a manager  the regulator details for yourselves  and an email address so I could send this message. I was advised they couldn't tell me who the regulator was  they couldn't give me an email address but should go to BT.com for an email? (don't think that's going to help.) and finally I would receive a call back within 2/3 hours. however the fact in 24 hours ive been promised 4 call backs (I think it's 5 but im too disgusted with this service now to count)  and finally when I said I wanted to speak to the manager the advisor disconnected the call. A) I wasn't even given a warning (again) for a second disconnection. B) I wasn't abusive  swearing  personal or direct with my (understandable and justifiable anger)  also when I asked to speak to your complaints department your colleague refused saying there was no need as there is an open complaint and just kept refusing... WHAT IS THAT ABOUT! Please can someone from a managerial position contact me before you close today from a relevant department to discuss and rectify this matter with a professional reason  such as an actual reason  not supplier (BT Open Reach) Difficulties. I have now been more than patient with the level of service (or none (not Corey's team  who have been fantastic)). If that manager cannot be bothered to deal with me regarding this issue then by veto I want it raised to there manager and so forth until this issue has been fully rectified and I have been compensated for the above issues.  An exceptionally disgusted and outraged (I don't even know if I'm even being considered a customer)Customer.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2016-10-28~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Utterly useless. For over a year we've been getting in touch with BT to change the bill date to the 1st of the month  every time they say it's done yet every month without fail the broadband is cut off 2/3 days before the bill date. We get in touch again and some guy who speaks barely a word of English tries to tell us he doesn't have a clue (which I believe  don't think anybody over there does) Almost painful how bad BT are  nothing but trouble.~~~,Dunfermline ~~~,2016-10-28~~~,1,1,3,1
I'm a partially blind man  I notified bt of this when I took landline a broadband  1st they sent me the wrong router  then  they could not get me broadband to work  lost count of the times I contacted them  landline kept crashing   broadband would not work  they wanted to charge me over £100.00  to come and check my internal line  6 months later it was their junction box at fault.  Two years later and hundreds of pounds out of pocket  I have decide enough is enough  but leaving bt is another challenge. Crap crap crap Bt. Only interested in talking money  avoid like the plague.~~~,Sutton surrey~~~,2016-10-28~~~,1,~~~,1,1
BT are the absolute worst provider I've ever had to deal with. They frequently lie/ignore customers  don't care one bit about their customers and seem to go out of their way to make things more complicated than it actually is. The broadband service we receive is completely unreliable  when we've complained we've just had inadequate responses and our latest interaction with them has been q complete joke. We are moving house and all we want to do is move our account across (because we still have time on the contract so until that point we can't switch to another provider) but trying to get BT to do this has been an absolute farce. When we finally got a date just to have the line connected (and booked time off work to do this) they then changed the date to a later date. This means we have to rearrange with work and also means we'll be without internet for a month which we're still paying for! We will not be renewing our contract with BT and I'd advise anyone considering BT to think again.~~~,Reading~~~,2016-10-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Pathetically poor service  over 25 hours on the phone trying to get incorrect charges emotes from my account. BEGGED for somebody with the right level of authority to speak to me to reverse incorrect charges and the release me from  the remaining ten months of contract. Nothing doing - silence. Complaint letters - unanswered. So  I cancel the direct debit and call ZEN (A++++ SERVICE!) to hook me up. Then  I get a response! And what a CRAZY experience that was. HELP!! They won't let me go!! SAVE ME!!!~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2016-10-27~~~,1,1,5,5
"I ordered my broadband 2 months ago  including installation  it took 4 weeks to get my kit delivered and BT then decided not to send somebody to install my broadband because i already had a socket in the place i moved in. After delivery  for 2 weeks the internet did not work and i had several calls with the ""helpline"" until they finally sent some engineer. Now  since again 4 days after the engineer was here the internet is still not working. I paid more than 50£ of phone bill for the ""helpline"" and am being told the line is still not working. I wanted to cancel after 14 days but was told to wait for the engineer. Now they tell me i have to pay !!300 £!! Cancellation fee because the 14 days are over although i pad already 3 weeks for internet which is not working. I wasted every day 1-2 hour on the phone trying to talk to somebody with no result  had to take off hours at work to wait for the engineer  cannot do my work from home  will getbtroubles with taxes becausei cannot do my online banking and ALL BT DOES IS TELLING ME THAT THEY ARE SORRY AND THEY WILL TRY TO FIX IT??? NO REFUND ON MY PHONE COSTS  NO REFUND ON MY HOURS OFSPENDING ON THE PHONE AND THEY REFUSE TO CANCEL MY VCONTRACT??? i have never experenced such bad customer service  normally i have been with virgin media and never had such issues. DO NOT GO WITH BT!!! Its a waste of money  time and nerves!!~~~",oxford~~~,2016-10-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Have been waiting 6 weeks for broadband  original engineer visit installed hub but said there was something wrong with the outside cables  now waiting for someone to come dig up the pavement outside our house(supposed to be the 27th but no one showed up) Advisers seem helpful and will promise all sorts but don't actually seem to achieve anything for you. Honestly the most disorganised  incapable company I've ever dealt with. I don't think we're EVER going to get broadband!~~~,Kilmarnock~~~,2016-10-27~~~,1,3,~~~,~~~
I have been with BT for 10 years now  on their Unlimited Infinity 2 Broadband and Phone for £52 a month. the phone is fine  and at the start  the Broadband seemed great. However   Speed tests at bt.wholesale.com are always good  at around 75Mbps down /18Mbps up   I am switched my provider with SSE at the moment. because of that same service cost just £21...very cheap saving over 60%~~~,LONDON~~~,2016-10-27~~~,5,5,5,5
Terrible customer service. My broadband hasn't worked for weeks. Contacted but several times and was told I would get a call back but never have. But is the worst don't trust them and don't use their service. My dad ordered a bit box that till this day hasn't arrived. This service is terrible!~~~,Essex~~~,2016-10-27~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

I have ordered my brodband at the start of September.On that occasion I have been told that even if it will be two separate instalation charges of £50 I would be charged only for 1. I have been told that about 10 times during my first call when I was ordering the broadband. They conected the phone  fee days after internet and tv. And the problems starts tv box didn't work.Contacted the servise to have it replaced- impossible. They had to send and engineer to fix it and as we said we are in work during the week nobody get back to us. And guess what our first bill was £100!!!!!!!!!. Surprise surprise. I call be the bt on 15th been on the phon for 30 min been told I will receive my money by next Friday. And whats happend? NO MONEY ARRIEVED. Called again on the following Friday asking whats happened with my refund  apparently nobody placed it but this time they will speed it up and it will be on my account soon. And whats happend NO MONEY ON MY ACCOUNT AGAIN. Started to get a bit annoyed. Contacted them on the chat just to be told again NOBODY PROCEED THE REFUND. And the person I am speaking with has no power to refund my money and I should speak with PERSON WHO PROMISED ME REFUND!!!!!!That's started to feel like a sick joke. Called the customer service to heard that I SHOULDN'T BE WORRY. Coz the complaint beeing placed and now I have to wait for the complaint o be resolve before I can see my money.Great.MORE WAITING FOR MY MONEY. Really not happy with customer service and their structure. Last time I was dealing with them.~~~,Cheltenham~~~,2016-10-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
