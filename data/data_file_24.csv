Not only do BT feel it's OK to increase the price of their sub par broadband product  but they also find it very easy to cap speeds whenever they find fit. I have never bought a broadband product from anybody and received such a bad experience.~~~,Failsworth~~~,2018-01-22~~~,1,1,1,2
Terrible customer service. BT left me with no broadband for 6 weeks because they said it was an Open reach problem and Open reach said it was a BT problem (even though there the same company) I was passed from person to person hung up on 6 times and promised 7 call backs that I never received. And when enquired about cancelling my contract I was told I would have to pay the cancellation charges even though they weren’t providing me with the service I was paying for. When they finally fixed the problem a very rude manger said all they could offer as compensation was my money back for 4 of the weeks did not have service and that money would only be offered as credit on my BT account not put back into my bank account. They also charged me a extra £130 for an engineer visit that was supposed to be free because my home hub was not working and when I asked for that money back they said they couldn’t do it because the ONE person out of the whole company that can do that wasn’t in. So I still have not got my money back because that one person still is not in and they’re basically refusing to give it back. I would STRONGLY advise anyone considering BT as there broadband provider to go else where. They are a joke and will just take you for a ride to try and get as much money out of you as possible.~~~,Scotland ~~~,2018-01-22~~~,~~~,~~~,2,~~~
BT are not cheap  they claim broadband speed up to 50mps  every time I check mine I just about get 17. So why should I pay out over £50 a month for such a slow speed. If I complain they say its my line in the house  they offer to send a engineer out to look and want to charge even more money. Also if you have a long contract they can still put their prices up at any time.I would not recommend BT.~~~,GRAVESEND~~~,2018-01-21~~~,2,2,1,2
Terrible customer service. Too many departments and people passing the blame. If something goes wrong with your account it takes phone call after phone call before anything is sorted and nobody gets back to you as promised.  Most of the customer service team are polite but are using a system that is a complete shambles.~~~,Scunthorpe~~~,2018-01-18~~~,1,1,3,2
What can I say and where do I start . I went with BT  June 2016 I was an ongoing With Cancer Treatments  I had to have a large section off 1 side off my Face Removed  . So there would be numerous Maxifacial Plastic and Optimology work  to be carried out . Unfortunately I am Lao a Transplant  patient. During the numerous ops Mum and Dad botched died in October 2017 with cancer within 8 days off each other . I was backwards and forwards also to the Hospital. Finances spiralled out off control . I phoned BT in January to pay £207.00 they said they had Terminated the Contract. I now owed £429.00 but no Service or House Phone . There  attitude was appalling . But there was nothing they could do . I do not claim Any Benefits or get Financial Help . The Hospital say I am Vulnerable living on my own . The Jury is out . I rest my case . P.S I have had massive Support from my Bank and Credit Card Companies . Who Recognise Cancer . I Really don’t know what to Say . More than happy to send  BT Facial Proof if anybody had the Stomach or Guts to see what is a Terrible Plauge on Society. Regards Steve N .~~~,Rotherham ~~~,2018-01-18~~~,1,1,3,3
Paying for Fibre and we have about 50% service.  Less when it is a busy time.  BT Customer Service say all the right things but rarely act on what thet say.  They always seem reluctant to get Outreqach involved  my guess is that since they are now 2 different companies BT has to pay a charge.~~~,Swansea~~~,2018-01-18~~~,2,1,2,1
I am absolutly disgusted with this company. Its an absolute joke. We signed up in September and after issues with them connecting us its been one thing after another. We are still waiting on a £45 reward back due to how much of a mess around we have had. We repeatedly had to chase everything up and each time speaking to someone different. Once our contract is over we will be going elsewhere. If I wasnt so annoyed I would laugh at how pathetic this company really is. The last time we were with BT they used to up the bill without notifiying and thats why we switched over. This time round we thought we will give them another try and we wish we hadnt!~~~,Scarborough area~~~,2018-01-17~~~,1,1,3,3
We have been without broadband for 6 days as BT disconnected are connection after we asked to change provider! As offcom say your provider should keep you connected until your new provider take over. BT have broken the terms and conditions of our contract and we are still waiting for a call from case management but we have been told this can take up to 48hrs! Considering they are a multinational telecommunications company trying to get them to put this right is impossible please take note of this comment as they should not be able to get away with this service and we will be handing over our complaint to Ofcom~~~,Southport ~~~,2018-01-16~~~,1,1,4,1
When it works it's not to bad...but operative word is 'when'. They are a law unto themselves and like all major corporations answer to no one. Customer service is zero... all you can do is just wait until they are ready to provide you with the service they charge an arm ans a leg for...gangsters~~~,london~~~,2018-01-15~~~,3,2,2,2
OMG if anyone wants to get Broadband from BT - DON’T  been with them over 15 years and my B.B. went down between Christmas and New Year  first call for anyone employed was for today  so 2 weeks later  I waited for someone to come to be today  then first call “yes they are coming give them to 9am”  second call “oh it wasn’t booked properly so can’t do it till next Saturday” Now three weeks no internet and used phone data and been told will not be reimbursed for that either. So Customer Services now less than 0%.  Sorry forgot to advised been on phone to them for over 4 hours all in all. So save yourself from the frustration and go hit your head against a wall as you will end up with the same pain.  Go with any other supplier as though their customer service is also rubbish you will save some money.   Very frustrated BT loyal (until now)  customer~~~,London~~~,2018-01-13~~~,1,~~~,1,1
"Bottom line: avoid like the plague.   My story.   Have had BT phone line and 'copper' broadband for 13 years in a rural location.  Speed and reliability poor (1-4 Mbps  flaky  frequent dropouts) but what can you do deep in the countryside?  Then  excitement!  Fibre has come to our hamlet.  We applied for BT Infinity.  4th Jan it gets turned on.  Nothing.  We have no broadband at all.  We book an OpenReach engineer to come the next morning (if 8am-1pm is 'morning').  I take the day off work.  No engineer.  BT have cocked up booking him.  They reschedule for the next Thursday 11th.  Another day off.  Engineer rocks up past midday.  He works for a couple of hours.  ""There is no way for you to get Infinity - the wiring of the boxes is all wrong.  They shouldn't have sold it to you"".   Nothing to be done: going back to copper next week (I hope).   I lodged a formal complaint.  Now we're arguing about compensation.  What's their offer to compensate me for two days off work  at least 2 weeks without internet and 4-5 hours on the phone?  £20.  I've told them to think again.   Utterly disorganised  useless  incompetent rabble.  Do yourself a favour and go elsewhere.~~~",Kent ~~~,2018-01-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Avoid at all costs! Horrendous customer service!Initial connection took ages. Then they charged me before I ever got it  I called to complain and they told me to wait they'd fix the bill. In the meantime broadband was finally setup (for two days) then they cut the line cause they said I haven't paid the bill (of the internet I never had! First month's bill was something over £32 for basic speed  *up to 17Mb and phone line no special extras! Then after all that they charged me something over £15 for late payment!~~~,London~~~,2018-01-11~~~,1,1,2,1
"Fibre ordered 11th November 2017...as for years have had max of 1.5 speed  here..Instead BT cut off my broadband totally 15th Nov to 15th Dec ...HOURS of phone calls after days at work to BT  & Openreach (for which privilege I am charged!)all over country & India  numerous promises of switch on and help  and repeats by myself that we have NO fibre and never  had engineer call to fit box inside or out...achieved no fibre and a month to reconnect copper..stress all round as little signal on mobiles either. Children's A levels falling behind as all on line. Still no fibre it appears it's  a ""records issue"" and I have to wait yet again... My patience with such an inept ""business"" is running out.  Any other business would be closed down.~~~",Heathfield East sussex~~~,2018-01-11~~~,1,1,1,1
It's obvious from the plethora of terrible reviews that BT suck. I agree that BT most definitely does suck. How is my £15 mobile phone internet faster on tethering than my £70 a month BT Fibre?! The staff on the phones pass you pillar to post with infrastructure problems whether you're contracted or not and can be unpleasant  along with crappy long queue times to do even the most simple account checks. Save yourself some time  choose ANY OTHER PROVIDER. You might save enough time to learn a new language  or maybe knit a jumper. Or at least you'll have a router provided that doesn't cut out exactly at the most important part of every show and video game you will ever be part way through. What's weird is that I'm not even a biased or negative person!~~~,Bridlington~~~,2018-01-11~~~,1,1,1,1
What can I say. BT are a shower of s****e. Their broadband is slow in my area and keeps dropping. Since November I have had a faulty land line so no phone/broadband. I have been lied to constantly by an “Executive Level” Customer complaints advisor. So I am “walking” and going off to Virgin Media who activate me on Saturday. The funniest thing is BT Openreach’s sub contractors (Oakus Limited - what a bunch of cowboys) turned up yesterday lunchtime and started digging a trench for a new phone cable. So BT will now have to restore the pavement at the same time as losing a customer!~~~,"Alveston, Bristol~~~",2018-01-11~~~,1,1,2,1
Joke !!! don't get BT  I got BT because I watch bt sport and thought it was a better option. I was massively wrong! I'm tied into a 2 year contract that would cost me £500 to cancel !!! my internet is slow !! and BT Freeview is awful !~~~,blackpool~~~,2018-01-10~~~,1,1,1,1
DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY. Just don't. You will save yourself a whole load of hassle. Go with someone else. In fact using data on your phone will be a better (not to mention a faster and cheaper) option. We signed up for BT broadband when we moved house. The moment you sign up  the problems will start. You will be greeted by incompetent customer service staff who either cannot  or will not help you. The reoccurring theme throughout your experience will be this;1- There is a problem with your internet/phone service  so you call up BT2- You will spend 10 - 20 minutes on hold 3- A non native English speaker on a bad line will answer your call. After answering your questions with quotes from a script  they will put you though to the relative department4- You will spend ANOTHER 5-15 minutes on hold.5- A slightly more competent person will pick up. Sometimes they're able to understand you  sometimes you'll be able to understand them  either way after listening to your complaint/query  they will give you answers from a script. If you're dissatisfied with their answers  they can;A- put you though to the complaints department (WASTE OF TIME!!! These guys are masters of bullsht and will have you hanging up in no time in the false hope that your problem will be solved. I found this to be the worst department of all  they lie though their teeth just to get you off the line!)B- Go and 'look on the system to see what the problem is' Exactly what these people do when they say they'll do this is a mystery. Naturally they will put you on hold AGAIN while this takes place and at the end your problem still wont get solved.At this point  you will have been on the phone for around an hour (40 mins if you're lucky) and you have TWO options- hang up and go back to 1Stay on the line and go back to 4I have wasted far too much of my life trying to sort out problems after problems that I can honestly say no other company has. After months of frustrations  we went with someone else. 7 days later  we have fast fibre! Suck it BT  you're a joke.~~~,Norfolk~~~,2018-01-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Really bad service. Supposed to get up to 52mbps for 'super fast broadband but getting only 7mbps. Engineers called out 4 times. Previously had 32mbps but keeps dropping back down shortly after engineer 'fixes it. Expensive for poor service. They charge loyal customers more than new ones. I wouldn't recommend BT.~~~,Pontypridd ~~~,2018-01-10~~~,~~~,2,~~~,3

Worst customer service I have ever experienced. The operators never do as they promise.I had to cancel twice and even then they got the date wrong.I was billed incorrectly and promised a refund (even have the email proving it) but instead was billed again and told it was to late to stop that payment.Cannot put into this short review just how useless this company has been.~~~,UK~~~,2018-01-07~~~,2,1,3,4
Been waiting for 3 months for open reach to repair my phone line. After numerous engineers I don’t have a constant phone line  broadband spends more time down than up. I payed for infinity to get new hub due to an engineer saying my old one was faulty (didn’t cure my problem) hence I still get 1.6 download Av  when working.~~~,East Runton ~~~,2018-01-04~~~,1,3,1,1
BT is a joke. When we first moved to them from Sky they said it would cost £34.99 per month but since then it's been nearly £50 every month. We called to bring this up and they said it was correct. So we thought we will bide our time and move when 12 month contract finished. They are now saying we can't terminate because I am using the bt sport app and from the day I downloaded it the 12 month contract started again. This is total rubbish I never signed no extension. They are asking for £170 to come out. Please do not go with bt they don't give a **** about their customers. Bigest mistake we ever made~~~,Chester ~~~,2018-01-01~~~,1,2,5,5

"Tried to cancel within the 14 day period. Emailed confirmed cancellation but they did not act upon it.  I was left with BT Broadband for a month. Requested to transfer to another provider which they had to accept. But as soon as I did so  broadband became very slow. Webpages and emails took many minutes. Doesn't appear to be a ""good company"". It is unfortunate that BT owns the phone lines. Its min broadband speed is 1M. So you will only get a refund it is below this. If you can find a better provider you might want to switch.~~~",Warwickshire~~~,2017-12-31~~~,1,2,1,1
An explemary example of a company totally out of control.Moving to BT ? A unique experience. Duplicated customer accounts   billing cock ups  unintelligible customer service reps   the list is endless. Commenced service early December with promises of this speed and that. Result no where near ! Switching supply to another provider . Interesting that responses to emails to customer service take forever but cancel and you get one in two hours ! So on an 11month unexpired contract at £40 per month you can expect to get one of these emails. As you're still within the minimum term of your contract  you'll need to pay a charge for each month you've got left. We expect this to be £469.96 by the time you move.  You'll also need to pay:  £65.00 for BT broadband equipment charges£152.09 for BT TV equipment charges. This email was just after receiving one offering higher speeds e.g 76 Mbps if I signed up for 18months irrespective of the fact current contract is 52 Mbps and actual is 32mbps if you are lucky. Forget writing to OFCOM they are weak and totally unable to control BT.  Lots of very bad publicity is what is needed ..~~~,Cirencester~~~,2017-12-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT Broadband - 2 months of broadband failure. Been told fault on line after several engineer visits  but  still not fixed. Have rung up to 30+ times to have signal reset inc 3 calls on Xmas day! Disgusting customer service throughout. No apology and had to ‘barter’ for limited compensation to cover costs and get broadband payments refunded. Lack of interest in trying to resolve issue has been astounding and after being told yesterday the fault had been fixed  it went again today! Can’t even leave for different supplier as the fault is in exchanfge or on the line. BT may have the best coverage  but are not interested if there is a fault.~~~,South Wales~~~,2017-12-30~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~

since the release of fibre in our area the speed has been great and reliability good. Until the 23rd of December  since then wemve had no connection and BT’s unbelievable lack of ability to do anything about it has left my completely gobsmacked. I’ve been told its an area fault  I’ve been told its a property fault  I’ve been told it’ll be fixed in 24 hours  twice. Then wednesday  then I made a formal complaint  this somewhat esculated their attention span  with a call back on Friday (today) after the problem would definitely be fixed  to no avail  now its Friday night and I have to wait until Tuesday. I’ve been told openreach do work the weekend  but for limited reasons  apparently a £60 a month customer for god knows how long doesn’t warrant that sort of attentipn despite being without service for a week. Just unbelievable~~~,Margaretting~~~,2017-12-29~~~,2,1,4,2
Awful service   do not go with BT.  I arranged to change over to Bt  got the set up date   confirmation email   equipment and they cancelled my order due to sky not releasing the line until the day after.  They did not inform me of this until I rang up on the day it was meant to go live and asked why my broadband had not gone on.  Told me I had to re order in 2 more days  when I did this then they said they could not put my phone /broadband and tv on for another 3 weeks.  After many phone calls with staff who did not care or take ownership I went back to sky as I did not want to give them my business.   I have never experienced such bad service and would never recommend BT .~~~,Liverpool~~~,2017-12-29~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~

"I have experienced some difficulty with buffering of my broadband from time to time and more recently over the Christmas period. I checked my current monthly price and noticed that it has risen to over £40. I have checked the lastest deals with some being cheaper than my own but offering better connectivity etc.When I spoke to a BT representative to question my account I was told that because I have been outy of contract for a long period of time that the best deal they could offer me was a £7 discount. Hows that for being a 10- 15 year loyal customer.I asked if he could offer a better deal than that but was told that ""THE COMPUTER SAYS NO!!!!""I will of course change provider. It seems that being a long term loyal customer means nothing these days. Not good enough BT.~~~",LEEDS~~~,2017-12-28~~~,2,~~~,~~~,2
Other than the broadband being really slow despite living in the city centre  I had an awful experience cancelling it  on the edge of scamming. I tried to cancel it before my one year period expired  and I was told I have to pay a cancellation fee  which makes perfect sense. So I decided to wait for the 12 months  to pass  still paying monthly even if I wasn't really using it. Fine. After the one year period passed  I called again to finally cancel my broadband: the customer service told me that the contract automatically extended for another year  and if I wanted to end I had to pay the same big fee I had been trying to avoid by keeping my contract active at my expense.  These are the kind of things which you have to be very careful of  designed to screw money off you. Therefore I feel scammed  I will pay the exit fee but I will never ever recommend BT to anybody  as my experience has been awful.~~~,Nottingham~~~,2017-12-25~~~,1,2,2,4
I reported a fault with my broadband ( receiving 1mg instead of 55mg) on the 7th December. I was informed after at least 10 phone calls it was a fault at a substation and it would be fixed shortly  now we are at the 23rd December with no resolution  I have called at least 20 times not including 4 times today where I was promised a call from a senior manager none which were received. I have now made a further phone call and been told it has been passed to a case manager and someone will call me back within 48 hrs not including Christmas Day  I asked if they would give me a resolution date and they no it will just be call to let me know who my case manager will be. I HAVE TO SAY BT OFFER THE WORSE customer service I have ever known.~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-12-23~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
High and increasing costs  slow rubbish connection for both phone and TV. Picture breaks up on HD Channels epsecially. Also had no end of nuisance calls  they register your number with random business so that they think you are a client or a service provider.

Shockingly  shockingly bad. Getting 2MB in a 20MB package when people in the same area are reaching 10-16MB. Add to that constant dropouts for a minute or more every 15 minutes.  Went through various procedures with someone in India for 3 days  trying everything  only for him to conclude that he couldn't fix it  but the system wouldn't allow him to book an engineer visit. Asked to speak to a supervisor  and line was cut. Sent a complaint - no answer.  Woeful. The worst experience of Broadband in 15 years.~~~,Cilcain~~~,2017-12-21~~~,1,1,1,1

BT is officially the worst internet provider I have had at my property since the last 14 years. Virgin media  Sky  Talk talk all internet providers that I have had over the space of numerous years I can't emphasise enough how bad your service for internet is...  but I will put it to comparison. My 3 from my mobile is quicker than your service I get 29.00-35mb never lags or lets me down. How do I know ?  by having to pay additional £5 everyday for internet that I have paid for which is shocking. Some will say why would you ?  1. I have 3 kids  2. 1 off which at high school needs it for history essay 3. At uni needs for reasearch  3rd 1 needs it for cumputer games  my tv connects to the internet so everything me or my misses can't watch nothing  i need to the internet for work but I can't use it becouse my phone has become a wifi hotspot completely shocking and it's not just 1 day 3 days  it's been over a week !~~~,Glasgow ~~~,2017-12-18~~~,1,4,1,1
Upon advising BT I was moving to another provider they cancelled my services and line. This was despite me specifically advising I would be making a working line transfer/takeover. In my opinion the agent's actions were intentional and malicious. As it prevented an order being placed by another company - resulting in a two week gap without phone or broadband. Intentional or not  the 'mistake' as acknowledged by BT could have reckless consequences. We have two children and being contactable - and able to make calls is very important. I strongly recommend avoiding BT.~~~,West Lothian~~~,2017-12-18~~~,1,1,1,1
