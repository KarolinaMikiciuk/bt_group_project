I have been with bt for years but very dissapointed the way i was treated. Very poor customer service with rude unhelpfull advisors.  Switched to another operator now. Very dissapointing bt!!~~~,London~~~,2017-03-31~~~,2,~~~,3,3
never purchase bt because you never get the speeds you pay for. I pay for 70 down which is the best package. If im lucky I will only get 5 down which is shocking~~~,~~~,2017-03-30~~~,1,2,1,1
I have an absolutly abysmal broadband speed of around 0.4 to 0.7 mb  and often even less. I often stare at a blank screen that wont even load up a page.I am paying good money for a rubbish service to BT  who could not care less. I have complained about this without any improvements whatsoever.~~~,eccles on sea~~~,2017-03-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Avoid BT like the plague worst customer service i have come accross in almost 50 years rubbish product rubbish company don't touch with a bargepole.~~~,Barnsley~~~,2017-03-29~~~,1,1,1,1
BT signed me up for 55 MBPS. and charged me for that rate  in fact I Only Achieve 18MBPS download and 2.3 mbps upload.So basically being charged for speed I am Not getting. But BT come up with excuses I am  to far away from the exchange. Though they never told me that when I signed UP.~~~,swanmore Hampshire~~~,2017-03-28~~~,3,2,3,3
Stay away!! I can't overstate how terrible this company is.Huge lead times on getting setup.Random increases in monthly costs.Shocking customer service (once you finally get through to someone)And as for trying to leave... book out a week of your life to speak with the entire callcentre.~~~,Guildford~~~,2017-03-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Where do I start: Customer service? What customer service  the advisors don't seem to care about my issue I must of called 8 times in a week each time they put me on hold  test my phone line and say my phone line is fine EVIDENTLY it is not as the router flashes orange in would seem 24/7. Got an engineer to come out they fixed it then it just crashed again and same problems started. They then sent me a new router and the same issues continued. It is of utmost certainty that you mustn't choose BT and instead choose Sky or Virgin as they provide a far superior broadband to the rubbish I am currently receiving. Thank you BT for absolutely nothing.~~~,Derby~~~,2017-03-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I never review companies but have made an exception for BT after  a 5 week long battle and 36 phonecards I manged to achieve an Internet connection for 10 days before they tried to charge me £118 for my trouble!! I attempted to leave them and was told I would have to pay £200!!! Then they disconnected me for refusing to pay a bill so high for 10 days service. I rang and argued it and had an extension agreed to April to allow time to contest such a high bill. Just come home and found out they have disconnected me again. They refuse to put you through to a manager. They've promise to escalate my case to a special team then I end up back in the loop of customer services who have no authority to help!!!! Never had such terrible service. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!! I've taken to the time to review so no other poor person has to suffer such an inadequate rubbish service!!!!!~~~,Upminster ~~~,2017-03-27~~~,1,1,3,1
WORST COMPANY IN EXISTENCE - DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. Can't communicate or deal with custom efficiently  takes forever to get through for a service that is shoddy at the best of times for mega expense DISGUSTED~~~,Horsham~~~,2017-03-27~~~,1,1,1,1

I have had BT for over a year now and i have continuously had problems with internet speeds. Your internet is possibly the worst i have ever experienced. I Find it unacceptable that i am living in London (one of the technologically advanced cities in the world) and i have the same internet speeds as  children in Africa. I find it ridiculous that i am paying over 60 pounds a month as a student and i am unable to load a 7 second Facebook video. Your service is probably one of the worst i have ever seen and i recommend people looking for internet providers to seriously consider not paying for your horrible service. Btw I recommend you to provide the option of 0 stars on your ratings above.  Kind regards  Kevin~~~,Willesden Green~~~,2017-03-25~~~,1,1,1,1
There are few words in english that would sufficiently capture the incompetence of BT customer and technical service. I ordered broadband a month ago. That it hasn't arrived obviously is not news. But the reasons customer service have given could not be made up. From bandwidth to red light to mismatch between BT and service team to previous user (new build!). It wouldn't have surprised me to hear that a snake was found in the neighbourhood and so no broadband. So was told to expect a call (before 9pm!!) today that would solve all problems. I've been sat at home since. I called at 8am  2pm and a few minutes to 9pm. No call. In fact the night team finally suggested to wait for that call 5 days hence!! I have never been so frustrated. Why would there be such universal opprobrium against a service? And why is that service still in business? BT has a monopoly of the market and this  MUST STOP.~~~,Solihull~~~,2017-03-23~~~,1,1,1,1
I have had BT service for over three years and have been tirelessly disappointed!Only recently did I finally get broadband service which has allowed me to view movies and online videos at a decent rate.  However  my internet WITHOUT FAIL turns off and on 2-3 times daily.  It's extremely inconvenient as it disconnects me from my work and family.  BT is the only available service in my area  naturally  or I would certainly be choosing another provider.  For what I pay each month  I expect more reliable service!~~~,Red Lodge~~~,2017-03-23~~~,1,1,4,1
Absolutely awful!!!! Don't go there... poor customer service...Stick with sky or virgin  even talk talk beats BT~~~,Banstead~~~,2017-03-22~~~,1,1,1,~~~
Absolutely awful  poor customer service!! Wished I'd never changed service provider. Will be cancelling and going back to sky!!~~~,Banstead~~~,2017-03-22~~~,1,1,1,1
PLEASE DONT Ever use bt or move to bt their fiber broadband is the worst ever broadband I had in my life speed is awful and it doesn't connect called customer support they sent me an engineer charged me £250 problem is still the same use any providers but not BT Thanks~~~,Thornton cleveleys ~~~,2017-03-22~~~,1,1,1,1
PLEASE NOTE: Do not change your service to BT; they have provided the worst service I have received in 40 years of being a home owner. The transfer from Sky to BT took much longer to achieve and was not conducted on the promised dates. My house was left with no landline for over a week; at that time I was working away from home and this caused stress and upset to my family and me. BT have now increased their prices and I have missed the cut off date to cancel my contract and move back to Sky. This has resulted in a cancellation fee of £181.71. Please choose another provider.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2017-03-22~~~,1,1,1,1
BT must rate as the most useless company in the U.K. Service - rubbish  customer service - painfull. Eight days to get a simple modem problem resolved with littl or no help from their customer services~~~,Worcestershire~~~,2017-03-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute terrible company where most of the staff hang up on you after spending an age getting through. Will most definately be my last contract with them and will make sure all family members do the same~~~,Glasgow~~~,2017-03-21~~~,1,1,2,2
I have recently tried to move from BT  as we have new providers in the area. Their contract terms are impossible - exit fees are outrageous. Even after they increased their prices and gave us 30 days to exit without penalty they changed the exit period so I would have had to move same day or face over £350 penalties. The customer service agent didn't care and told me 'we're not the cheapest and we don't price match' - this can only be said by a company who have you cornered or provide a level of service that's exceptional and worth the extra. BT's service isn't all that!~~~,"Worthing, UK~~~",2017-03-21~~~,2,3,2,4
I changed my parental controls a months ago on my iPad without issue. Ive been trying to adjust them but when i click on 'manage extras' the next page is completely blank. After a call to BT and then a call back from the 'parental controls' dept  they cant explain why and say i need to be logged into a PC while on the call to them  i dont have a pc. They didnt have an alternative scenario  i have to get infront of a PC and call them back. Ridiculous.~~~,Newport~~~,2017-03-20~~~,2,1,3,3
Had issues since day one  even with placing the order. To receive the gift card included in the offer I had to call every day for 4 months.Decided to cancel because they decide to increase the price for the second time in a year. BT tried to convince me to stay offering me to pay more (???). A week before the end of the contract the quality of the line dropped drastically.~~~,Sittingbourne~~~,2017-03-20~~~,2,1,2,2
I'd like to place on record that BT are useless. Moved house recently and decided to stick with BT. They cancelled services at old house 3 days too early. Taken nearly 2 weeks to activate BT services at new house. In the meanwhile they sent two BT smarthubs to new house. On activation day line wasn't activated. Phone BT call centre in India to report issue. On hold for half an hour and got transferred to another department and then cut off. Phoned again in the morning to report fault and they booked an openreach engineer to come this morning. Openreach engineer called me to ask where am I and I said at home. Found out that they've sent the engineer to the old house! Can't reschedule for today so cancelled BT altogether. Luckily Virgin provide in my area so going with them. Stay away from BT if you want to avoid frustration  poor customer service and belligerent attitudes.~~~,Rotherham ~~~,2017-03-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute waste of time and money.  I have been charged for a service I did not receive and find it impossible to get through to anybody who knows what they are doing.  AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS~~~,Plymouth~~~,2017-03-17~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been monitoring my broadband speed daily and am constantly. Receiving only 1.22 Mbps most evenings. Despite paying for a 76Mbps service. Why are we the customer having to put up with this the so called providers are taking our money and not delivering  THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE.~~~,"Summerhill, Wrexham~~~",2017-03-17~~~,2,1,1,1
Trying to switch CON. Once you have contacted your new provider  details are sent from that new provider to BT  but BT send you letters  texts and emails to say you have not cancelled all services and you will continue to be charged by BT for the services. Yet you know you have ordered all new services. So you call BT  they then try to sale you a new deal. You also are supposedly unable to cancel the services yourself over the phone  and they tell you your new provider is the only one that can do that. And so on in a loop of never knowing why BT are not getting the full cancellation from the new provider. Dishonest conduct  using the prospect of charges to make you call  then to talk you into continuing to buy their services  and you were never actually able to make a diference from the call anyway. Shame on you BT  trying to steal money whilst hiding behind your contracts of small print somewhere.~~~,Glastonbury~~~,2017-03-17~~~,1,1,3,3
Even paying for BT's most expensive Infinity package cannot get you a reliable connection.  Forget about working from home or playing multiplayer games. Whenever I call them they ask me to test the connection speed and restart the router. Of course the problem is not that there is NO internet but that it keeps disappearing. I have not been able to explain this to them  usually they tell me there is no problem.~~~,Tower Hamlets~~~,2017-03-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Do not use BT. I am now with V*** pay less and get brilliant broadband. Bt never worked. Every time I complained they persuaded me I just wasn't paying for enough. Despite having assured me it would cover all my identified needs at the point of agreement. So I went up several times. I have been with them for 5 miserable years. Intermittent internet  never ever enough bandwidth  I could never watch Netfix or Amazon long enough to catch a whole film or episode. They charged through the nose  huge charges for something or other- my bill was always a lot higher than agreed- for overuse charges. I only sometimes had the chance to ak what was going on as it would always take hours. Finally I switched and NOW THEY TELL ME I HAVE TO PAY £31 CANCELLATION FEE even though this is not a new contract. Keep well away.~~~,London~~~,2017-03-16~~~,1,1,2,2
Had their full BT system in for 2 weeks and still unable to watch ALL the channels  even after TWO engineers have been out.The latest engineer told me my plug filters had not been cynked in.Now their engineer department are telling me I have to go buy a booster plug.DO NOT USE BT!~~~,West Yorkshire~~~,2017-03-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely terrible !!  staff are so rude. Hung up on me when they took out over 100 pound of my bank without a reason!~~~,~~~,2017-03-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Rude  terrible customer service. I took contact of phone line and Internet back in April 2016 and today I call them that i am moving house and my contract is expiring on 11th April so I don't want to renew another 12 months contract and when I move to new house I will decide at that time about the service provider. They told me that I need to pay £31.00 to shut down the broadband  at the time of contract nothing was mention to me that there will be £31.00 charge at the end of contract to shut down the contact. They told me that it is in the terms and conditions  they should tell every customer that this is the charge you need to pay at the end of contract. I will never ever use BT services in future and will not recommend to any family and friends.~~~,"Tooting, London~~~",2017-03-12~~~,1,1,2,1

Up to 4 Jan 2107  Broadband Download speed for my cluster of neighbours was dropped to below 0.512 Mbps  which does not qualify as Broadband anyway. It has been between 0.32 and 0.47 Mbps since. I have had an OFCOM monitoring box (SamKnows)on my BBHub since September 2016. BT want user to use their BT-controlled 'Wholesale' tester  which I do not advise as they control it.  Use an independent speed check and keep screenshot records. The only device attached to my BT Hub is the OFCOM/SamKnows box: this is important as they try to dismiss their inadequate service delivery as too many WiFi devices attached to the Hub. Help/Support staff seem to have very poor technical knowledge  just try to convince you that it is all your fault and are reluctant to send out an engineer.  Use their CHAT means to make a complaint as this keeps a transcript of your Dialogue. Ensure that you use the Word Complaint  not Problem  if they are dropping your service speed.~~~,NORTH EAST BEDFORDSHIRE~~~,2017-03-12~~~,1,1,1,1

Shocking service! The worst customer service! Past from pillar to post  left with no phone line for 3weeks and each time given a different excuse!~~~,Stafford~~~,2017-03-10~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst service I have ever had both in terms of customer service and broadband. Their staff are rude with total disregard to customer service and lack even basic customer service skills. Stay clear of this company. I had the broadband service installed in Jan 2013 and it never worked properly even for one day. Frustrated with their incompetence and total disregard  I switched to Sky in Aug 2013 and have been happy with broadband ever since. BT on the other hand  instead of apologising and refunding the bills that i paid for the services i never received  they are chasing me for terminating the contract early. Pathetic  absolute disgrace they are - stay well clear - be warned!~~~,London~~~,2017-03-09~~~,1,1,1,1
"Unbelievably contemptuous company that could not give one stuff about its customers. Just joined them and immediately had a price hike. Yes I can leave but what a way to do business. How can Ofcom allow this company to trade when they openly brag that ""We can change any prices and terms during your contract""????  Totally unfair contract term. Absolutely disgusting way to treat customers one month into their contract.~~~",Isle of Wight~~~,2017-03-08~~~,1,1,5,5
