Awful dreadful service. Never again. I've wasted a whole day waiting for a box that they decided to cancel. Not only that but I spent 53 minutes trying to ask what happened and I was out through to four different people all as clueless as the rest~~~,~~~,2015-01-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I ordered infinity after a call from bt trying to get me to commit to a new contract. The installation immediately caused problems as they removed an extension from my hallway which was no longer suitable. I accepted this as I was expecting super fast infinity broadband. This hasn't happened!! We are constantly dropping out  speeds are not brilliant. I can't download films from Sky anymore as they removed the extension I was able to use. I cannot speak to anyone but an Indian call centre and they use the scripts and are unable to deviate.  On contract until Feb 2016 (6 months in on an 18m). I wish I could get out of it  horrendous service  no customer service.   Dealing with BT Business cock ups at work and coming home to deal with BT home cock ups.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2015-01-20~~~,1,1,1,1
"We are currently paying for the top Infinity 2 Broadband package. Promise at point of purchase was for a minimum of 50.7Mb download. We have noticed for a while that this is not what we are getting (download fluctuates between between about 6Mb and 28Mb & there are times when we have no connection at all) & when we rang we were completely fobbed off & told they can provide whatever they want & that our contract means nothing. Customer service staff were very difficult to understand due to limited English & were very rude and insulting at times - I was asked whether I understood the number 17!!!! I decided to ring sales to try & change our package & the guy on the phone admitted that there is clearly a problem with our broadband & that it is clear that it is at their end. He also said that they had to provide what they promised. He sent an engineer (had to take unpaid leave from work) who confirmed that everything at our end was absolutely fine and that it was BT that had the fault. Nothing was fixed & again it all went off so I rang again & then we were told we would need a phone engineer this time. When I rang again they said it was pointless to send a phone line engineer as the fault was definitely with the broadband & we had had that checked out and our side showed no fault. The girl on the phone said our problem went way back & that we are loosing connection or speed upto 1000 times a day. After 2 more weeks of monitoring it she rang on Friday to check the speed - her response was ""that's brilliant"" when I said we have 4 Mb download. When I questioned why she thought it was brilliant she said it was because its working fine!!! Anyway she rang to check on it again today & was surprised that I was upset because we are still no further forward. She is sending another broadband engineer to test everything all over again - another unpaid leave from work!!!Worst customer services I have ever experienced - been told I am ""stupid""    they don't listen & have no interest in actually solving any problems. How do they get away with it?~~~",Rotherham~~~,2015-01-18~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
ZERO STARS: Why would anyone consider joining or transferring to this totally incompetent lot? If you're thinking of either don't waste your time or sanity unless you're a complete masochist!  I placed an order 33 days ago  paid line rental in advance  had a commitment an engineer would be installing the equipment and have had the run around between their 'back office teams' trying to tell me they are unable to 'find' my line.  All this despite the fact I've told them over the phone repeatedly the 2 numbers previously used.  They cancelled my first order without even telling me  promised me calls to be returned within 48 hours and at no stage did they ever return the calls forcing me to pay over Â£20 in paid calls for being penalised by their totally unprofessional and inept call centre staff.  I demanded escalations and got flogged off between various back office staff who struggled with some of the basics of English let alone who knew the procedure to deal with situations like mine.  33 days later I'm now left with having to resubmit a new order and wait in line.  Totally pathetic!  Unfortunately there are no other providers in this remote area otherwise I'd have given up ages ago.  Do yourself a favour - avoid like the plague!  Mr Patterson you have a very serious problem and need to listen to your consumers.  My complaint is being forwarded to the top level and I personally hold you responsible.~~~,Newdigate~~~,2015-01-18~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Would avoid in the future just for the sake of their customer service. After nearly a month of problems  and two weeks without any service  we're finally up and running with no problems (fingers crossed). Their customer service is despicable  I think I spoke to upwards of 50 people before getting our issues resolved (we moved back home and brought our service with us  they cut the old service at the house off before telling us it would be a month before the new one would be live!).  If you have no problems then I'm sure BT are fine  the broadband is good (although sometimes a little patchy when a lot of people are using it) and the phone line is fine.  I would avoid at all costs just because of their customer service though  the most appalling company to have to deal with.~~~,Herefordshire~~~,2015-01-18~~~,2,1,4,3

I changed to BT Infinity from Virgin to save money and I believed there would be no loss of service. I was very much mistaken. Since it was installed we have yet to have all 3 services working (phone  broadband and tv). Both my partner and I work from home so the interruptions on broadband have caused us major problems and I have spent so much time calling and emailing - all to no avail. Customer service is atrocious and I have constantly asked to speak to a manager as I am looking for compensation and to cancel the contract however I won't be paying them a penny as I believe their products are not fit for purpose. I am thinking of taking my complaint to a telecoms ombudsman. Has anyone tried this route and any success?I award no stars for anything BT have supplied - dreadful service and would never recommend them.~~~,Hamilton~~~,2015-01-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Useless - I think I have spent over day on the phone transferring between departments to get my blasted broadband to work. Every call has lasted about 3 hours and all asking the same questions again and again. My broadband works sporadically and is soooooo slow. BT engineers don't turn up for appointments after you've taken the day off work. If you can get someone else  try them unluckily for me I'm contracted until the summer which I will spend in Costa using their Wi Fi as mine is beyond useless.~~~,Shenfield Essex~~~,2015-01-13~~~,1,1,1,1
BT has been nothing but trouble from Christmas time this year.  While everything had been running fine for about a year  we developed an unknown fault and our speed disappeared. Calling residential customer services is like entering into a Monty Python sketch.  I have been told incorrect information  reassured excessively that they would fix all my problems and my problems would never come back  begged by them to accept their help when I complained that they were not resolving my problem (this was very unusual)  and told I have no problems and everything was ok.  They rang me back at inappropriate times (close to midnight walking everyone up)  told me they found a technical fault  and when I asked them to explain this  they said it was a technical fault  and when I further asked them to explain it  they said they could  but it was technical.   While I am not trying to return a dead parrot  and instead  just have my broadband repaired  I have gone around and around and around and around in circles  and my broadband is still rubbish.  They are fine when things are working  mainly because you do not have to interact with customer services.  Once things go wrong  they go from bad to worse very quickly.~~~,Norfolk~~~,2015-01-13~~~,1,1,2,1
Ordered BT broadband infinity2 on 24/12/14. Hub arrived on 6/01/15. Engineer booked for 08/01/15 to install. Never arrived. When I called Bt told I didn't need an engineer and should be connected by midnight on the 8th. Never happened. Have made numerous calls (all to India) and it appears order management department in India cannot communicate with the engineersdepartment in the UK as every time they put my order on the computer the engineers are saying there is a duplicate order. Don't know what this means. Now they tell me I have to wait till 27/01/15 and again have to take a day off. I am now waiting for a call from them on 14/01/15 to sort and if not will cancel order and go to Virgin. Terrible customer service. A telecommunications company who cannot communicate with themselves or their customers.~~~,Finchley ~~~,2015-01-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
All of the reviews strike a chord with our experience of BT.  It is like being in a parallel universe where all normal rules of customer service go out of the window.  You wonder at times if you are going mad.  Another 18 months to go !~~~,Essex~~~,2015-01-12~~~,2,1,1,2
"BT have been absolutely disgusting and disgraceful during my 18 month contract with them. The internet was much slower than promised  the monthly fee for a new customer set very low but after one month I was paying almost double the figure I had agreed. When finding out the contract was 18 months even though I agreed to 12 - I was met with a rude responses from their customer services team stating I would have to pay over Â£200 to cancel. I was even told to ""move back to your parents house and have the line installed in your bedroom"" which would incur a Â£130 fee on its own! I was never once listened to and never once received any apology for the way I was spoken to by multiple members of their staff. A few months later after giving up and continuing to pay a silly amount for slow internet  due to being made homeless I was forced to cancel the contract and have since incurred their ridiculous fees of Â£180. They have threatened me and written me the most disgraceful letters that I have seen from any single company. Hidden charges  extras and fees left right and center. All of the rumors are true - BT are the worst internet providers you could have the misfortune of joining.~~~",East Sussex~~~,2015-01-12~~~,1,1,1,1

I cannot believe the customer service! I called the 0800 number to discuss my present package. I spoke to a male who continually yawned throughout the conversation and didn't appear to have a clue what he was doing/saying.I thought he was under the influence ! I put down the phone redialled and a female answered this time. Not very clear on what I was asking and couldn't multiply 12 x Â£1.22. She told me she wasn't a numbers type of girl ?  I asked to speak to Team Leader or manager but conveniently no one was available. What awful service and quality! BT don't deserve my years of loyalty and money. I dialled the number which costs you and asked them to call back. This time I got a polite trained operative who knew what they were talking about. Will now look for an alternative after 30 years.~~~,Scotland~~~,2015-01-08~~~,1,1,3,3

I was misold my BT contract under the premiss that we were in a BT Infinty area and therefore my Internet speed would suit all our needs.We were told the sales call was recorded?However  we are not in a Infinity area  and our internet speed was chronic - the best we got was 2 mghz when at point of sale we were promised a minimum of 12 mghz! Even the catch-up TV buffered continuously!We live in a busy town  we have 3 children who need the internet for Uni and schoolwork and my wife requires it for work.We have had several calls to the Technical Dept and have been told to turn off this  they'll fix it remotely  switch cable points - none of this worked - no-one called to help resolve the matter so we have had no other choice than to go back to Virgin and pay the two contracts until BT  expired this month.We phoned to cancel BT and we are fuming because a 'Brian' from Scotland  who was very amicaable  told us that despite knowing the above  we would still have to pay a Â£30 broadband disconnection charge!!!! And give 30 days cancellation notice!!!Bearing in mind they didn't even come to put it in  the box was delivered and the internet was connected in the exchange!!!I asked to speak to a Customer Service Manager but was told there was no point? BT you ought to be ashamed to charge us this - we should really be receiving an apology from you for mis-selling the product originally and a refund for the last 5 months that we have had to pay for both Virgin and BT!!!DISGUSTING!!!

I have stayed with BT for many years  and just upgraded to Infinity  when it was installed I was told by engineer  I was getting 79 mbs into my house.  I was very happy after previously getting on average 3 mbs.  Engineer left  and since this I have never got any where near the 79 mbs proported.  At sometimes I have even gone as low as t he old 3 - 3 mbs.  Very unreliable  hub always needs rebooting.  average speed is  usually 15 - 20 mbs  if I'm lucky.Spoken to helpdesks  always get overseas  who are absolutely useless.  and just pass you from pillar to post and fob you off.  BT  I am very unhappy with your service  but I am sick of spending hours and hours n the phone to your helpdesks. AVOID!!!!!!!~~~,Norfolk~~~,2015-01-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Promised 80Mb/s but getting around 5Mb/s said there is a fault in the area for around 6 months now. Customer service is awful  you get on the phone to india and they tell you the same thing over and over again. When the internet does work  which is very rarely  it works very well with good high speeds but its reliability is shocking. If you want a bad provider that throttles you and has bad reliability  BT is for you. Otherwise  STAY AWAY!~~~,Ely~~~,2015-01-03~~~,1,1,1,1
BT wifi is simply not fit for purpose. We have had it for over a year and have invested in power boosters etc  and NOTHING has worked consistently. In desperation we even invested in the Â£10 per month tech support service - and all they tell us is that our house has walls.... and this is what is getting in the way - who knew???  Our wifi signal is erratic  slow and sometimes  non existent - but the BT tech expert always told us - ' you are connected and the signal is strong' - that may be so in the modem - but around the house it fluctuates wildly throughout the day - much stronger in the morning but deteriorating in the afternoon and evening - I'd accept the 'walls' explanation if the signal was consistently useless - but it is not. BT are using ancient copper wire technology which too many users are having to access - we are returning to Virgin next week and cannot wait. BT should be ashamed of themselves and we should be given a refund. And their Tech support service should start telling the truth!~~~,"Muswell Hill, Lonndon~~~",2015-01-03~~~,1,1,1,1

I tried to swap from Virgin to BT.  Two engineers arrived fitted the router. But after they left I discovered that my phone was not working and I did not have Infinity 2 which I had ordered but a much slower version.   After being on the phone every day for over a week during which time I was assured that I was not a customer of theirs  then that my account had been closed I finally got them to say that I did actually exist and that they would send the engineers back to fix the phone and install the Infinity broadband I had ordered.   The date came for the final installation.  No engineers arrived.  I phoned BT.  They said it had been cancelled possibly by some computer fault.  They then said that I would then have to go back online to re-order as the offer I had been given was not available by phone. I said I wanted to go back to Virgin but they had to fix my phone line.  They said as this was not part of a broadband installation they would have to charge over Â£130 for this despite my protests that it was their engineers that had caused me to be without a phone for more than 2 weeks and with inferior BT broadband for the same time.  The only positive thing to say that at this point and with many hours wasted I asked if their cancellation meant that any contractual obligation I had to BT was at an end? They said yes. I am now back with Virgin.   If this is what BT are like when they are trying to get your business what must they be like when they have you locked in a contract?  Avoid at all costs.  This was perhaps the worst customer experience I have ever had with a major company.~~~,London~~~,2015-01-02~~~,1,1,1,1
So glad I found this review site as it's clarified I'm not imagining how poor BT services are. For the 16 months I've been complaining of drop out broadband unable to use BT email mail lost BT sport freezing constant lies and fob offs from call centres an engineer came before Christmas and confirmed the cause of the trouble. Seems two local boxes have cards running 50 lines and my box has four faulty lines. Told me other service providers are also using that box so at any time my line has been connected to any different terminal as lines moved to 'resolve' the latest complaint. This is borne out by my bank security not recognising my IP address and other sites I use confirm my IP address has changed within hours of sorting it again. I also received a warning despite having unlimited broadband my usage was excessive. It's very obvious it's all running on a wing and prayer. 2 hrs yesterday of call centre who then also lied to uk engineering. Well BT today I decided enough is enough I've given notice I'll go elsewhere as at no time have you been physically capable of providing the service I'm paying for as your management apparently take the view ok 4 lines are duff but that leaves 46 that work and so it carries on. I'm going to chronologies events for Gavin Paterson and off com expecting a substantial refund of monies paid. I've also been told today my PAC code will be with me in 5 days time. See you in Court.~~~,Cheadle Hulme~~~,2014-12-31~~~,1,1,1,1
"I'm getting the impression customer services are hiding/running away from me.I've been a loyal customer for years for both telephone and broadband.We have just had fibre band trunked to our village and whilst waiting for the endless failed installation dates I decided to review my contract with BT on the promise that I would be able to upgrade to fibre when it eventually came. It came in November and BT have just slashed the cost accross the Internet. Nowhere does the advert state ""excludes existing customers"" the usual BT con. When you attempt to order it (on line only) you are asked to enter your land line etc when suddenly the price jumps from Â£10 to Â£24. I called BT sales who tried but couldn't explain either.BT like so many other companies who don't want to contacted make it so difficult for people to email them by putting dreams and reams of smokescreen and diversive links to divert us away from the ""email us"" links. They lodged a complaint on my behalf and said I would get a follow up call. I've heard nothing. BT provide an appalling customer loyalty programme when it comes to upgrades and renewing contracts. Where are you? Why are you hiding and avoiding me?When are you going to start treating customer retention as a priority rather than taking advantage of the hassle of migrating to their competitors?~~~","Stone, Staffs~~~",2014-12-31~~~,3,1,3,3
This internet speed is worse than in my home in South Africa. Do not go with this service as you will regret it. Netflix streams in the lowest quality  webpages take ages to load and iTunes downloads can take an hour for one song! DO NOT GO WITH BT! This is a warning.~~~,East Finchley~~~,2014-12-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Very expensive. The Broadband upgrade we received is slower than the package we were on before... and the connection keeps dropping too. Customer Service were poor when we called for a price review  they said they couldn't offer us a better package even though they advertise better packages online. BT has not changed and is still a money grabbing organisation with only its shareholders in mind and they simply do not care about their customers. The products are poorly made and the new menu guide on BT Vision is far too complicated compared to the previous version. Poor products  poor service  overpriced.~~~,manchester~~~,2014-12-29~~~,1,1,1,1
The problem with these review sites is that people only post to them if they are having problems  hence the peer ratings here are completely un-representitive. I thought I'd provide some balance. I ordered Infinity 2 as an upgrade to my existing BT ADSL  the modem arrived on the promised day  and the service was provisioned on time. At the time of order I was told that I was likely to get a speed of about 50Mb/s  the connection speed I actually get is 70Mb/s  the connection is completely solid and so far there have been no slow-downs or dropped connections. The BT homehub 5 provided has the latest ac WiFi technology  so all my devices get the full 70Mb/sec over WiFi from most rooms in the house.  I am therefore very happy with all aspects of the service.~~~,Brixham~~~,2014-12-29~~~,5,5,5,5
I would like to say that from the time I was given infinity free for a year I stayed with bt. The speed specified was upto 79 Mbps and that was achieved but my problem was the Wifi . I am using a bthub 3 and in my opinion the wifi range is abysmal. My hub is upstairs and in the room below is my sky box and broadband adaptor  every couple of hours the adapter lights are both on but my tv is telling my wifi signal may be too weak. Bt need to improve their hubs to give everyone better range and less time loosing signal.~~~,telford~~~,2014-12-26~~~,2,4,4,4
I moved to BT from Sky because Sky wasnt up to the standards I wanted. What a mistake. From day one BT was only running at 2.4mbs  instead of the 4mbs I was promised. BT said we will send out an engineer to check the line etc  but if its found to be anything that isnt BTs fault you will be charged Â£129. I was confident I had checked everything was ok so I allowed an engineer to come. The engineer didnt say a deal and left. NEXT Bill - yes youve guessed - Â£129. I rang up fuming and was told 'you switch your router off at night'. I explained that having seen a few burnt out routers on Facebook etc thats why I switched off. Ok  in fairness they did refund me. All went well for 3 months thereafter  until a guy from BT rang me about BT infinity. I showed an interest but didnt buy  but believe me  my broadband hasnt worked correctly since. It is down now  and has been for the last 3 days. The nice guy in the Indian call centre assured me an engineer would look at my problem tomorrow. However a call 5 mins later from the same nice Indian guy was bad news - they wont be looking tomorrow after all. So its a case now of just wait.I wouldnt recommend BT to my worst enemy. I always thought they were a reputable company with a good reputation  but having had to deal with them when things go wrong proves what a tinpot company they are.

Recently moved home and since I was an existing BT customer I decided to opt for the seemingly straightforward choice of sticking with the same company.I called BT and told them to transfer my services to my new address (for which an engineer visit would be required) and was informed that the earliest available date would be 23rd December - a full month after moving. I said sorry but that was unacceptable and I would be seeking an alternative provider. An early date of 8th December then miraculously became available. An engineer visited and stated work needed to be done outside of the property for which another visit would be required. Thus far no one has arrived on two occasions and a third visit has been arranged for yes  you guessed it  22nd December with services commencing on the 23rd. I have no faith that will happen.In the meantime I have spoken to numerous BT staff who plainly have no idea what is happening as very little information seems to be recorded. I have received emails stating the customer care team would call on a certain day but no calls. It has been explained to me that I didn't receive calls because they had the wrong number  yet sent me a TEXT to tell me they couldn't contact me because of this! So  having stated that waiting till the 23rd of December was not acceptable  I now find myself hoping that my services will be connected on that date. In my opinion I was lied to in order to retain my account. There is little or no communication between departments  trying to speak to a supervisor is a hopeless cause as it seems it's not their policy for senior staff to dirty their hands talking to customers and BT employees seem to make things up as they go along.Unnecessary mobile calls over the past four weeks have left me out of pocket and I'm still paying for Netflix which I haven't been able to use along with xbox live. BT are a truly woeful company who don't deserve the loyalty that many show them. I am currently seeking an alternative provider.Do yourself a favour and do the same.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2014-12-18~~~,1,1,1,1
