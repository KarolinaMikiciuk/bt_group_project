absolute rip off!  terrible broadband speed  . I phoned and asked bt to not renew my contract but have been told that I did not say cancel the service so now have to pay for 30 days.  I'll never use this bunch of thieves again...~~~,bs24~~~,2014-10-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Very poor customer service from day 1. Broadband very slow and dropped connection every day so needed to be reset.  TV recordings always missed off the end of shows which resulted in not being able to record anything properly.  I exited the contract early and took the additional cost of this to switch back to sky and after 8 calls to try and send the equipment back I ended up being charged for this. Had a rude lady on the last call tell me the charge was right even though it had been agreed I would return the equipment. Ended up paying the additional £65 rather than speak to them again.~~~,Sutton Coldfield~~~,2014-10-15~~~,1,1,1,1
BT offer a terrible service at a high price. Since starting a subscription with BT we have had to call customer services at least once a month. 8 months on and we are still experiencing problems with an intermittent broadband. Frustrated by calling the customer services  put on hold for over 30 minutes at a time  and constantly 'fobbed off' by an advisor. We are still waiting to receive an answer. We are now tied into a contract for 18months which is disgusting  as BT have not provided a service which they promise. In addition  we have no HD channels or a free BT Sport which was included as part of the package. Avoid this company at all cost.~~~,Wiltshire~~~,2014-10-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Utterly useless service. My line speed went down from about 6.5mb/s to 1.6 mb/s. After a few days of this not improving  I reported the problem and was told that BT only promissed me better than 1 mb/s and so were not even allowed to make a note of my issue. Switching to Talktalk. Oh and usual problems with indian support staff whose english is abysmal.~~~,Brentwood~~~,2014-10-14~~~,1,1,1,2
Changed to this 5 months ago when engineer unpacked vision box their was no controller he fixed me up with one that seems to work but not the same as instruction book first thing book tells you is read before setting up the instructions will not work with this controller contacted Bt many times three controllers later none the same as book Bt send instructions a number of times does not suite remotes that I have instructions not book but Google downloads some with print so small and such but print out impossible to read so still cannot use box to what is its full potential perhaps I should not be surprised at there attitude as it took EIGHT years at previous address to get them to send my bills to me not the local builder STAY AWAY FROM BT anybody will give a better service than this~~~,South Wales~~~,2014-10-14~~~,1,1,2,2
Ordered infinity2. Two weeks after the order they started changing installation dates. Said I wanted to cancel  so they fast tracked my order  and promised an early connection. After booking another day off work  they cancelled that date. Have now left BT before even being connected and will wait for Sky fibre.~~~,Cornwall~~~,2014-10-13~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
So took BT Vision package out including broadband etc 32 days ago. Only had their services up and running for last 6 days  poor performance so far.Phoned BT to cancel package after trying to speak and deal with customer support that hardly spoke English. Apparently the cooling off period is 14 days after you placed the initial order  took over 3 weeks for my services to be working so how could I say I was not happy with their services? How is this even legal to be out of the cooling off period before the products even work? Now they want £469.69 to cancel total robbery.Stay well away  shocking.~~~,Dorset~~~,2014-10-11~~~,1,1,3,3
Worst broadband I have ever experienced!!And they claim that BT's fibre optic broadband is one of the fastest on the market. Absolute joke. It takes an average of 80-100 sec for a page to load  never mind watching videos online. Stay away please!!!! Appalling service  poor quality  high prices.~~~,Newcastle~~~,2014-10-11~~~,1,2,~~~,~~~
Works fine if it is working. But the company has the worst customer services I have ever experienced. Hold times for technical support over an hour  engineers not turning up  rude staff and a refusal to compensate for unfixed faults. Unacceptable!~~~,london~~~,2014-10-10~~~,1,1,3,1
I upgraded to infinity after being badgered by BT to do so. Originally my iPad wouldn't work  bt told me it was Apple  I phoned them reinstalled everything  but eventually found it was a bt issue  now have been told by bt that my daughter's laptop is not connecting because the device has a problem ( was also given a number to phone where I could pay bt to fix it.) however  the laptop connects to the internet fine at other peoples houses. Also been told that my iPad constantly disconnects due to interference and I have to play around with changing the channels! Infinity is not fit for purpose.~~~,Isle of Wight ~~~,2014-10-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Since the new change over from Bt Yahoo to BT is is horrendous. The email if not used has to be restarted in 15 min or it times out. My email successfully switched over to BT from BT yahoo but toiday they lost all of my contacts saying I have none  U have been a customer for 15 years and will find anything at all other than them~~~,London~~~,2014-10-09~~~,1,1,3,1
I changed to BT broadband & anytime calls worst mistake ever my broadband is that slow it drives you mad l have called BT many times got through to India every time they are rude & can't help you at all  the only time l got through to the UK was  when l said l was leaving BT which l can't do as l am in a 18 month contract when l explained my broadband was slow l was told if l wanted it any faster to change to fibre optic my reply was at your price l can't afford it plus l want you to sort out my broadband that l am paying for l then got told where l live the broadband is slow which l no is not true l called BT before l changed and was told l would get a good speed  so now l am stuck with BT until Xmas 2015 and can't do a thing about it. I have sent them emails but they just don't reply.  SO BEWARE WORST COMPANY EVER~~~,Reading~~~,2014-10-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely appalling customer service. House move has been a nightmare  disconnected too early  left without broadband or phone.   Despite multiple complaints and escalations and promise of calls back.  Nothing  and they have the cheek to continue to charge me for the service.~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2014-10-08~~~,1,1,3,3
Unbelievably poor service.  Placed order two weeks ago  waited on Thurs for engineer to turn up. Didnt show  I phoned  BT promised to sort out and call Mon.  By Weds still no call so I had to call back - SNAFU - nothing resolved.  I hate BT~~~,Cambridge~~~,2014-10-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Do not  I repeat do not take BT broadband… Customer service is non existent and I’m still waiting after 5 weeks of no connection. You get passed around  appointments are not kept and you feel you have to personally man manage every step of the process. You will spend hours on the phone all to no avail. I wish I would never have swapped provider.~~~,Bristol~~~,2014-10-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Dreadful  abysmal  our rich language doesn't have enough adjectives to describe these clowns. Avoid like the plague.~~~,devon~~~,2014-10-07~~~,1,1,1,1
I recently asked BT to change the company name on 2 BT Business Broadband accounts we had with them. They did this for one of them (although the process was not simply  with lots of auto-generated emails confirming engineer visits etc. which were not required)  but for the other account they just cancelled the phoneline and broadband completely. Any attempt by me to get them to look into this has been met by stony silence. Complaints officially submitted on-line  which were acknowledged by auto-emails saying how serious they take complaints  have had no response whatsoever. I used their 'complaint escalation' facility  and again have had no response whatsoever. If this is how they treat their business customers (bearing in mind we have had business accounts with BT for at least 9  years  and still have 1 business account with them currently)  I dread to think how they treat domestic customers. I will do everything in my power to avoid buying any service from BT ever again  and advise everyone else to avoid them like the plague.~~~,Northamptonshire~~~,2014-10-04~~~,1,1,3,2

I was with Sky broadband and decided to move to BT for 12 months as it was on offer for the same cost and I'd have BT sport included. The reliability and signal strength of the router they so proudly advertise on their adverts is terrible. It has where near the range of my previous Sky router and drops connection. BT give you a 14 day cooling off period to cancel their services. The problem is it took over 14 days for the switch to take place from when I placed the order. Therefore I didn't know how unreliable their internet was until it was too late to cancel.~~~,Chertsey~~~,2014-10-02~~~,2,2,2,2
Zero Stars for customer service.   It took 70 minutes to identify that there is an outage which has apparently disabled email.  Checking outages  there is no fault in my area.   Have moved to Virgin.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2014-10-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
the customer service really is appalling. i have used sky and virgin before who have both been very accommodating. bt customer services are rude and will do nothing to rectify problems or address issues. it is like talking to a brick wall. they keep repeating the same thing over and over again without making any inroads or compromises. its either their way or no way. i will never use them again!~~~,NOTTINGHAM~~~,2014-10-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely shocking! DLivery didn't turn up. Engineer didn't turn up. Left without Internet and tv for two weeks. Charged for those two weeks! Was told to wait in for another delivery  still didn't turn up. Engineer came. I was told I would not have to pay for delivery and engineer but they put it on first bill which totalled at £90....should have been around £30!Was told I would have compensation of £55 and this we agreed could go straight into my bank. They did put the money in...then added it on to next bill!!!Cut me off during bill dispute. Finally they agreed that after I had paid an unbelievable amount of £112 for two months that I owed nothing more. Cancelled direct debit as they kept taking money on I agreed dates. Finally set up new direct debit when they agreed all would be as it should. Less than two weeks later they demand another £65  contacted them again to sort...hours later it was agreed I did not owe the money that all would be fine. I have been cut off again because the £65 has not been  paid!!! Absolute joke!!!! They will reconnect me after loosing 48hrs of connection but not reimburse the days I've been without!!! I have been sent round in circles continually in less than 3 months!!! Spending approximately 24hrs on the phone to BT and wasted 3 days at home waiting for them to not turn up.~~~,Devon~~~,2014-09-30~~~,1,1,2,2
Tried but failed for weeks to sign up to BT Internet due to the appalling incompetence of call centre staff - only to find a competitor could do it within the week. After 18 years as a BT Customer this is the worst customer service I have EVER experienced. Never again BT. Stumbled on this review site whilst searching for how to reach senior staff at BT - they have very serious problems and need to sort it out.~~~,South Yorkshire~~~,2014-09-29~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

I signed upto infinity broadband band last year and on the day of installation the engineer told me to test it out  I downloaded 10 songs within 30 seconds was very impressed.he left and from then my speed DROPPED the one day it took 20 mins to open a web page  I constantly had to complain to call centre in INDIA who were unhelpful and could hardly talk English. This carried on for a year constantly ringing and getting nowhere my speed was coming up as 10-17mbps they kept fobbing me off saying their computer showed I was getting 39.1 a total lie. Moving forward to last week I told them I was thinking of leaving and going to sky  was promised a call within two days they rang me when I was at work so asked for a call back after 5. Had no call until the next day when at work again and was told they tried ringing at 7pm the previous day but had no call as nothing on my mobile so they blatantly lied. Told them I was going to sky. The next day I had a phone call and spoke to someone in England trying to talk me out of leaving felt very pressured into staying but told them I was definitely leaving  was told would have to pay termination charges which I told them I shouldn't have to pay because I'd not received what I'd been paying for  while on the phone I did a speed test and it was 17mbps was told I would have to talk to tech team again and have an engineer come out to prove my speed was slow. Did a speed test today and all of a sudden my speed is 32mbps the most it's been EVER very convenient since I told them I shouldn't have to pay for termination and the fact they would send an engineer out which I'd be charged for! Stay away from bt at all costs conning b******s~~~,Worcester~~~,2014-09-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Call bt to get issues checked out  no phone  no internet and tv.  Just stopped working with no changes made. Send out first engineer  checks the line to the house.  Yeah ok to the house  I don't check phone or internet connections in the house.  You need to raise a call with bt to get the someone else to check those. marks the call as resolved. call get case reopened  send out the second engineer a few days later  doesn't knock says no one is home with house full of people waiting for them  marks the call as resolved. call get case reopened  send out the third engineer.  Turns up and fixes the issue.  no note were added. call to try and find out what was fixed  say the fixed the phone  internet and tv by fixing the router and that the unit was incorrectly connected which was causing the issue.Phone plugged directly into the bt socket still failed to work previously  but fixing the internet router mysteriously fixes the phone line.  It's an out right lie  purely done to make £129 call out fee  not happy.~~~,"London, Wood green~~~",2014-09-26~~~,1,1,4,1
Horrendous experience with BT.  Don't go with them. They said they'd give me vouchers when I joined. Didn't.  Just phoned up - they have a recording of the guy telling me I can have them  and they won't give them to me or the equivalent of them??????  They lied to get the business  overcharge  and they are so so so unprofessional on the phoen.  Don't trust a word they say.  Go with someone else.~~~,Bath~~~,2014-09-26~~~,1,1,4,4
Signed up for infinity broadband and my monthly bills went up from around £25 per month to £80 +. Apparentently wrong call package added.

Frustratingly bad experience. Two appointments required to re-activate a line  and second to install broadband - arbitrarily changed by BT to two different days. Asked to be called when the engineer and told this was not possible. Waited in all morning for the engineeer to arrive but he was a no-show. Called BT and could not speak to anyone who could shed any light on the situation  merely put through to an automated message  telling me everything on track. Absolutely no way I could recommend this company  and can find no positive comment to make about them.~~~,skelmersdale~~~,2014-09-23~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Joined BT from SKY last year because SKY was getting too expensive. Wish I hadn't! I ordered the whole package with BT online at the end of September with one of their offers. Got an email confirming order. A few weeks later when should've been installed nothing happened and nobody turned up. They had lost the order which meant I had lost the special deal and price and they said (more or less) its hard luck! I complained and eventually got the original offer and more with their top fibre optic broadband. When it was all installed and up and running I couldn't believe that I had been paying SKY'S high prices for so long because the broadband speed was brilliant (for a short while) and the TV was just what I wanted with a few extra channels and BT Sport. However  that feeling didn't last long! The BTTV box kept freezing between channels and had to be rebooted and reset every day. I had my 5th TV box about a month ago but and its still rubbish. The software has not been thought about properly and is not up to running the box. Numerous engineers have visited checking everything but nothing has really been accomplished. Fibre optic broadband started off good but then started dropping out numerous times every day. BT say that up to 10 'drop offs' a day are acceptable. Normally  that wouldn't have been that much of a problem but because BT Sport and the extra channels(SYFY  FOX  COMEDY CENTRAL ETC) are received over the internet  it means that these are unavailable until broadband is back up and running. It also means that if any of those channels are set to record during a drop out  then the recording fails! Many BT Outreach engineer visits later and 3 replacement Homehubs and the problem still occurs. Usually every afternoon for some reason. I have spent tens of hours on the phone to BT support and have had a slight bit of compensation for one month. A few weeks ago I decided that enough was enough and told BT that I wanted to be released from my contract because of their lack of service to me  and they agreed that they would not hold me to term but I would have to give them 30 days notice. I gave them that notice verbally during that telephone call and they said they would confirm everything in writing soon after. I then decided to join Virgin Media and agreed to an 18 month contract with their 'Big Kahuna' bundle. I got a letter a few days later stating I would have to pay BT an extra £101 pounds because I was leaving before the end of my contract!!!! I phoned them and explained that they had agreed to let me leave before the end of my contract but they said there is nothing on file about that. I then asked that they should listen to the recording of the phone call when this was agreed unless it had 'conveniently' been lost. They said that if there is a dispute with this and the recording had gone missing then the decision will go with the customer  so I will have to wait and see what happens. I can't say that I would recommend BT to anyone after my experience.~~~,Shoreham-by-Sea~~~,2014-09-20~~~,1,2,4,1
After moving to a new  house this year my wife and I decided to give BT a try after leaving sky  However this wasn't quite as easy as first thought? After three failed attempts to have the service installed and I don't know how many phone calls my wife had had enough  Not only have we lost money for her taking time off work but left us without any broadband and phone  To add insult to injury they now want to charge me £170 for the pleasure!! After more lengthy phone calls to Asian call centres (who by the way lie through their teeth) to try and resolve this issue they refuse to transfer me to anyone of seniority and hung up on me on more than one occasion! When I did finally get through to a English call centre to explain we had cancelled the service before the 29 day period they apologised and offer £20 refund and would have packaging sent for the return of their equipment GREAT. No not so great this again was just another lie so.....more phone calls no notes on their system of previous calls and guess what? Yes another bill came through. I am so livid with this company and would advise extreme caution should you chose to use them (note names times and dates you call them because they don't) for a big company the service is abysmal and they have caused massive stress to my pregnant wife and myself  This is to add to the loss of my mother to terminal cancer and my father in law suffering a massive stroke. My account number is-GB13404066 but expect this will be fully ignored as per previous attempts  Oh and before we end this review I have returned to SKY who did everything they said and haven't let me down once. So to sum up thanks a bunch BT.~~~,HALSTEAD~~~,2014-09-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Never had any problem with reliability or speed. I understand that some areas have really poor signal due to the lack of fibre optic broadband  however this is being addressed by the Government and Openreach so it is a case of sitting tight and waiting. Customer service was very friendly when there was an issue of switching payment methods. This compared to Sky 2 years ago is a million miles better.~~~,Cardiff~~~,2014-09-18~~~,5,5,5,5
THE most dreadful customer service I have ever experienced when moving house recently.  They were never able to deliver broadband for us  continued to bill us monthly after we cancelled our order and even threatened that our credit rating would be damaged if we didn't pay up.  It wasn't resolved until we threatened legal action against them when finally different departments started communicating.  I will never choose BT ever again and this was after 20 years with them.  Appalling treatment!!!!~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2014-09-13~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been trying to get the to fix a fault for 5 months. No follow up  deal with different person every time  no one calls to check whether its fixed (it isn't) no compensation despite being unable to use most broadband based services and take time off work for 4 engineer visits  won't let me out of the contract either.  just woeful~~~,Acton~~~,2014-09-11~~~,1,1,1,1

Having changed over to bt a out 6 weeks ago so I could get the motogp racing I can't fault the internet. However  as a bt customer you should get bt WiFi which for the last 4 weeks and daily phone calls normally an 1 hour + long and they still can't resolve the issue that whenever me or wife are out and our mobiles pick up a bt WiFi spot it will not connect  it refuses all passwords or knowledge that we even have a bt account. Basically they as much use as a chocolate tea point and I'm very close to cancelling the package.~~~,suffolk~~~,2014-09-10~~~,1,1,3,3

We had 3 weeks of agony  inconvenience and loss of income as could not use the internet for work at home. No friends or family could contact us. Go elsewhere.
