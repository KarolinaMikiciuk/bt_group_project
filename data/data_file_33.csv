Awful internet service. freezes all the time. It makes watching programs take twice as long constant freezing day in day out. Havent had any problems with any other providers     according to them they are the best.~~~,caerphilly~~~,2017-05-15~~~,1,1,1,1
They add extra charges here and there and didn't inform me that after my contract ended I would need to pay an additional £31 for them to disconnect the line.The advisor tried to trick me into staying with them as a new remnant is moving into my flat. What they failed to mention is if the remnant doesn't go with them I will need to pay the £31 disconnection fee plus an additional £40.99 month broadband and line rental. Overall a bunch of thieves go with Virgin or Sky. (Even talktalk are better)~~~,Leeds~~~,2017-05-14~~~,1,1,3,2
Was going to move to sky for free unlimited broadband deal. BT then offered a similar deal so I stayed put (better the devil you know than the devil you don't). Ever since my broadband has been wholly unreliable. A real issue as I work from home quite a lot. Rang up to complain. Apparently no problem with line but a dodgy hub. New hub arrived - low and behold exactly the same problem. Call me synical but free unlimited broadband seems to mean you have to fight it out with everybody else for the service - I've been a Bt customer since 1995 but clearly loyalty means jack! Unless it improves I will be moving at the end of the year!!~~~,SHROPSHIRE~~~,2017-05-14~~~,2,3,~~~,~~~
Switched to BT from TalkTalk via USWITCH on 11/04/2017  was meant to have my broadband and phone up and running by 28/04/2017 but only my phone was working. Contacted BT and they sent out a replacement router  still had the same problem. Then an engineer was booked but they failed to attend  i had to take a day of work and waited from 8am - 1pm. Contacted them again and they couldnt say why the engineer never turned up then rebooked my apintment. Same thing happened again and all i could get in response was we had a technical glitch. At this point i had been without broadband for 2 weeks and i am a uni student so i do need the internet and was having to run around using other peoples WiFi so at this point i wanted to cancel my services but the adviser advised me not to and that they will compensate me etc and that is should try resolving this matter and that they will book another engineers visit and make sure that its is fixed. This time the engineer turned up and fixed my broadband - (11/05/2017) So i contacted BT in regards to not receiving my BT reward card (£175) and they said its not showing on your account so we assume you're not eligible. I had a order confirmation stating i should receive a Master card of £175. All in all its the worst company ever i have been tied down to a contract which will cost over £400 to get out of. If you experience any problem make sure you dont listen to the companies nonsense and cancel your services. They're a bunch of liers and will do whatever to not pay out. I missed 2 days of work  thats £90 out of my pocket  but they dont give a damn. 1 star dont do justice  -100 more like. Would not recommend to an enemy.~~~,Birmingham~~~,2017-05-13~~~,1,1,1,1

I have spent countless hours over the last 2 weeks on the phone and the BT chat line as my broadband keeps dropping out.Despite an open reach engineer visiting my house and saying that the problem is at BT's end i have been met with nothing but waffle.I am now switching supplier as i have nothing to lose.~~~,Fraserburgh~~~,2017-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1
WOW! Twice now I have entered new contracts with BT and never will I do it again. First I set up one for my mother in her home and was left without internet for 4 weeks because twice the customer service advisors managed to put us on the wrong deal and then cancelled the orders all together rather than setting up new ones.  Then stupidly for my own flat I ordered BT thinking I'd be safe enough if I ordered it online. Engineer was booked for the day I moved into the flat. Received a text two days before saying an engineer wasn't necessary but low and behold it was and it took 2 weeks to sort out that. Then we moved flat within our 12 month period so transfer our account to our new address. 2 months later still no properly working internet will work for about 8 hours a day on and off and is really slow when it does work.. BT have offered a refund of £1.92 as they say that's all they can see of our internet not working. I've sat all night and watched my hub turn into some sort of disco light with all the colours you could imagine as the internet isn't working. We've had 4 engineers appointments one failed to turn up and therefore was a waste of my half a days wages to wait in and 3 haven't managed to fix the problem. Tried to get out the contract however they said when they run tests it's above the 4mbs speed that is the minimum. Even though the engineer said we weren't getting that and I've numerous screenshots of it when we ever do get a connection the highest being 2.13 mbs. Do customer services care? Can't say they do because the problem still isn't fixed! Ridiculous!~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2017-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst internet provider ever! Slow and unreliable internet (even though we have optic fibre)!!! awful  rude and useless customer service  telling us for two years that there are some technical issues in our area and everytime they give us different timeframes to when these will be completed. If I could rate it with 0 stars I would!! Overall satisfaction NONE!!!!~~~,London~~~,2017-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Horrendous. Did not connect to a nexus tablet and basically said it's tough there is no other option. Very poor can't leave a 0 star so 1 it is I am appalled. Avoid at all costs~~~,Edinburgh ~~~,2017-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1

The single worst company I have ever dealt with. Constant issues very slow communication just terrible. I've been stuck with them for 30 years as I cannot get an alternative service due to my location. I hate BT so much.~~~,Waterlooville~~~,2017-05-11~~~,1,1,1,1
STEAR CLEAR!!!!!!!!! If only I had the option of no stars! BT does not stand for British Telecom  more like BRITISH THIEFS!  This company is a joke guys you are really better off with cheap companies because you will receive a very cheap service for a very high price!  A rough idea of how bed it is? They keep increasing the prices  started out with a £50 bill and now is a minimum of 80 (price increases in the past 2 years) the service gets worst but the prices go up and there is not much you as a costumer can do! And their costumer service will make you lose your mind because they are  unfortunately  very very very bad at they job!~~~,London~~~,2017-05-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I am absolutely disgusted with the service we've had from BT  the lack of communication between its staff and the service itself! I asked for my account to be cancelled in January as i was moving and they are still charging me now despite me leaving the property and cancelling the line! I've just had to pay a £100 bill to close the account. I would not recommend BT to anyone for either its broadband service which took over 9 weeks for them to start or the customer service you get on the end of th phone! Absolutely terrible!~~~,Waterlooville~~~,2017-05-09~~~,1,1,2,1
E mail Gavin Patterson CEO and  explain the problem and you will very soon have an executive complaints handler to deal with one on one.....simple!~~~,ludlow~~~,2017-05-09~~~,3,3,1,3
"Had the old BT home hub which was absolutely fine then they talked us into getting a free smart hub! Is the slowest wifi i have ever experienced cant even watch a programme on bbc iplayer since we got it!! An ""upgrade"" they said!!~~~",Larne~~~,2017-05-08~~~,3,3,1,1
Very poor service. Plenty of process and talk but little progress in  a rural location.Finally quit BT and moved to 4g. Good riddance.~~~,AIRDRIE~~~,2017-05-08~~~,1,2,1,1
BT has improved over the past year.  The speed has gone up from 0.5 mbps to about 5 mbps.  Speaking to their call centre has greatly improved as they have moved from Mumbai to the UK and the operators are much more helpful. But they have made us pay for it.  We now pay 4 times as much as last year for still very slow speed.~~~,Inverness-shire~~~,2017-05-07~~~,2,3,1,1
Internet iservice fine but it is ruined by the the rip off price increase  2  months into my contract they put my bill up from £12 to £14.88  quite an increase! They said I could leave but they won't be refunding me my installation fee or fee I paid for the router. Companies should not be allowed to operate like this  it is a lose  lose situation for customers  I had already paid out over £200 upfront for line rental too. Did not expect this from such a big company especially 2 months after I join a contract. Go with a smaller company which has to treat it's customers properly~~~,Nuneaton~~~,2017-05-07~~~,1,1,3,2

A pathetic service  keeps dropping out and despite an open reach engineer visiting and saying that the problem is at the BT end they insist it isn't.Customer service is mixed with some agents trying to help but others simply cut you off or passing you on to other people. Over all for the cost i would say BT are rubbish. I certainly would not recommend them to any one.Even as i write this it's dropping out.~~~,Fraserburgh~~~,2017-05-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Promised delivery before Christmas but delayed til January.Waited in for three days for engineer to connect. As it happened I didn'tneed to grr :( as it was fixed at theit end. Customer service id abroad and there are communication difficulties.Intermittent disconnects.Pretty cheesed off with a price hike about two months after being connected and to find that I am part of fon~~~,Astley Shropshire~~~,2017-05-05~~~,3,2,3,1
"At the extortionate cost of £62 per month I am looking to change provider from BT to another. Although BT has been responsive to any issues  making improvements within a matter of days and being quick to answer the phone (comparatively)  I am optimistic that this service can be available at a lower cost - my energy bills have certainly improved since moving away from the ""big 6"".~~~",Leamington Spa~~~,2017-05-05~~~,3,4,4,2
Worst broadband company ever! Will never recommend. It hurts me to give them 1 stars each section  in order to write this comment. Either wise i would have left it at a minus. Ridiculous charges. Ridiculous customer service- we had problems with our network connection and I was put on hold for over an hour and then I had to speak to someone completely different. Apparently  there is a 30 pound cancellation fee  so they kinda squeeze the money out of you until the last second. Also  my flatmate (who has his name on the contract) got charged 75 pounds today ( monthly charge + cancellation) after BEING TOLD BY BT the money will come off end of this month. So  to sum up  not only is the service non-responsive  but also too expensive  and because they are so great and overcharged my flatmate  they got him into problems with his bank card. Thank you BT  but no thank you! Give a favour to the world and stop existing!~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2017-05-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Been using BT since dial-up days.Cannot recall any occasion where I've been annoyed by an interruption in service.Download Speed is reasonable at 26 Mb/s but not as fast as advertised.Complacent but happy I guess.~~~,blandford forum~~~,2017-05-03~~~,4,4,4,4
I had a contract  but they always send people 2 3 month and tell you they have better offer which just play tricks. Actually it won't be cheaper but you have a new long term contract. once I decided to move and try to cancel it  I been told have to pay the rest long term money £600 even I am not going to use it. It is cheating  the lady offered told me i could cancel whenever one month advance. very bad service! offered me hotspot but even now i haven't got correct login detail  offered speedy broadband but always no signal and need restart! The bill even themselves can't make it right! waste my time to call  every call i have to spend a half day for waiting! so please don't trust them! very disappointment.~~~,north london~~~,2017-05-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible from start to finish. We switched from Sky which was a huge mistake. They did not keep several promises about our start date meaning no internet for weeks. They stopped my service after 2 months  I called them and was told I had cancelled it (I hadn't). I then had to restart my contract from month 1 and my price immediately went up  I complained and got £10 back (it took several phone calls explaining the same thing to different people). The Internet has cut out several times over the year for several hours  I never called BT to complain as the customer services are terrible having to tell three people your problem. Finally ended the contract this week  was happy to pay up a penalty fee to leave as I was so fed up with them as they put our prices up massively meaning Sky is far cheaper again. Please avoid using BT..I don't usually moan either!~~~,Bury~~~,2017-05-02~~~,1,1,4,1
Worst customer service. Give fake promises then try to charge you extra for their mistakes. Overall very bad employers mess up the name of the company~~~,London~~~,2017-05-02~~~,1,1,2,2
Poor in all areas.  BT don't make it easy to get support - all well and good having internet help but when the internet is at fault it's pointless. A telephone appointment made for 6pm saw me rush home to be here - none came and eventually I gave up waiting and at 7. 20 pm I went outside to do some jobs . They called at 7.30 pm and didn't try again and didn't leave a message. I missed them by 3 minutes. Not impressed.~~~,Conwy~~~,2017-05-02~~~,1,1,1,1
If I could rate 0 I would faulty equipment which was set t he incorrect address.  Took months to sort out slow co connection. Cost a fortune and was offered £20 compensation for losing £1000's with work customer sevice dire then BT slapped a negative on my credit file as I wouldn't pay for a service they did not provide Criminal!~~~,Plymouth~~~,2017-05-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Shockingly bad.~~~,Gloucester~~~,2017-05-01~~~,1,1,1,2
after signing up with bt they took £59.99 from my bank I then cancelled the following day as I was being given a better deal with my current provider it took bt 8 weeks to pay back the money  only after I informed them I was taking the matter further after my experience with bt I would never consider going with them there customer service was a joke~~~,rochdale~~~,2017-05-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Don't get half of the download speed I paid for as in I pay for 73MBPS and I get 20MBPS  Internet connection cuts out frequently has useless customer support the only reason why I even have them is because I have no choice as other ISPs don't even have fibre optic in my area!!!~~~,Bonnyrigg~~~,2017-05-01~~~,1,1,3,2
I live in the heart of the Irish countryside and my current wifi is very poor. It is very slow and is limited so it gets slower and slower. Recently we have been looking to BT to get reliable and fast broadband  but in our area (Glenariffe) it is 2mb a second.2!! So we are stuck with very slow wifi which costs nearly £100 a month. Please fix this we are spending a fortune on wifi.~~~,Northern Ireland~~~,2017-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Good speed for our area. Just keeps dropping out every day without fail. Absolute rubbish bt not bothered or interested in helping. They just keep running checks on the line and telling me it's all sorted out. And it is until the next day! Utter rubbish~~~,Cuxwold~~~,2017-04-28~~~,1,1,3,1
Worst company I have ever dealt with  they lied about the price and since then I have had nothing but issues  cannot wait to leave them.~~~,Hockley~~~,2017-04-27~~~,1,1,4,4
BT have gotta be thr biggest shamballs out there. No internet for the past 3ina 1/2 weeks. Ring one person they slam you with one story. Ring another and somehow theres another yet completely different story. BT is rubbish. Absolutely rubbish! You dont get anything they give you with their package. My hub has  been flashing orange all day. If there was a way of shutting the company down and getting to declare admistriation i would so help out. Biggest scam of the century. I have no shame in writing what i am writing. I would not recommend them to anyone. As far as the fibre optic goes. There aint any. Its all a scam. All they want is the money from the customers. Thats all. Absolute disgrace.~~~,Slough~~~,2017-04-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Why pay for the most reliable and quickest broadband when it doesn't work? Completely cuts out with only 1 device using it! STAY AWAY THIS BROADBAND WILL CAUSE YOU MORE HASSLE THAN ITS WORTH!!! FIND A DIFFERENT PROVIDER!!!~~~,Surrey~~~,2017-04-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Ok so his is the first time I have ever posted a review but I thought it entirely necessary as BT are that utterly disgraceful and have been the biggest name of my life for the last month.As a milenial I prett ygood with this stuff. Ordered my new router 12 mo th package online  dinged up to bt mobile  got free bt sports- all good.Service supposed to start on 5th April- voicemail received on 3rd April (which has no callback number) informing me that due to area broadband will start on 24th April...Numerous call  complaints etc and dealing with kids on the phone  it becomes apparent they cannot do anything about this.In the meantime... my new bt sim arrives and is not compatible with iPhone. As I have no wifi this is a difficult issue to solve! Eventually by sim is working in iPhone and number is ported 10 days after intended time due to BT incompetence. The 24th April arrives... no BT broadband is activated and still not working. I would love to call customer service  but the Bt sim I have signed up for has no phone signal in xone 2 London-  are we dealing with cave men?Customer service for broadband is an automated voicemail asking you to go online to find help.  In my ling 27 years of living BT is probably the worst decision I ever made in my life- please do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs~~~,London~~~,2017-04-25~~~,1,1,1,1
