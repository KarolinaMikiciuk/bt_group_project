May I advise anyone unfortunate enough to subscribe to BT Broadband to check their phone bills. BT continued to charge me £3.72 per month for BB Talk Evening and Weekend Plan for months after the BB Talk service was discontinued.~~~,Clacton-on-Sea~~~,2015-09-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst experience  they offered a deal for a year subscription  then failed for 2 months after taking money to get us set up. We cancelled and it took 5 months and hours on the phone to get over £300 back. Avoid this company.~~~,Sussex ~~~,2015-09-04~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

BT is truly one of the worst broadband providers in the UK. I switched from Virgin only because they did not have services in my area.

I have been hit with 2 ODs in my bank account(as I could not transfer money to that account due to non availability of broadband) and lots of other losses. I have spent on an average 45 minutes per day on phone to the terrible BT customer care in India and every day they recite the same story""There is an exchange fault and we are resolving that"".

Promised I could receive speeds of up to 75mbps when signed up 6 months ago. Reported a fault on the line because of slow speed. Engineer told me I could only receive speeds of up to 37mbps at most after checking all the cables were ok. I called BT to down grade my package as I was not willing to pay for speeds that were impossible for me to receive. I was told they could not down grade my package and that to down grade I would have to sign on to another 12 month contract for which I refused and told them that it was they that are in breach of the contract for lying about the speeds I could receive in the first place to debate went on with customer services for almost half an hour. All they kept trying to do was tie me into another contract by saying there was nothing they could do  it was nothing short of blackmail the tactics they tried with me and I blatantly refused. In the end I finally managed to get through to them but my word they made it hard.I'm sure it must be illegal to make someone pay for something they won't receive.~~~,Bilston~~~,2015-09-02~~~,1,1,1,1
a most disgusting service- in fact the worst I have ever received from any company.  It has been so far an 8 month nightmare which is now resulting in me asking for a deadlock letter. I am utterly appalled that any company should be allowed to trade in this way.  there is no way I would ever suggest BT broadband to anyone. in fact their broadband in my view should be subject to external government scrutiny~~~,devon~~~,2015-09-01~~~,1,1,2,1
It might be OK if I could get it! Ordered it a month ago and still waiting for it despite the BT promises of to-morrow. Oh! yeah I forgot to-morrow never comes.~~~,Scotland~~~,2015-09-01~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I tried to cancel my service with BT 6months ago as I thought I had a 1sr contact but they informed me my broadband was for 18 months. so I rang them today to tell them I will not be renewing my contract which runs out on 17th September. I was told that the service will cease on 9th of September.  I said no on 17th September.so he said he changed it and that I will receive an email to confirm and low and behold I have received the email with the 9th of September. I am so angry. and I have also been told that I have to pay a £30 charge for not renewing my contract.  is this right????. never again~~~,sunderland~~~,2015-09-01~~~,1,1,5,5
We normally struggle by with 3MBPS. A month ago I reported the line as repeatedly dropping and the speed down to 0.2MBPS. I've spent hours on the phone to call centres  listened to their infernal queueing musak  waited in for them to turn up -two no shows. Now expecting a broadband engineer to turn up next week. If I wasn't on a fixed term contract I'd have dumped them.~~~,Yelverton Devon~~~,2015-09-01~~~,2,1,1,1

"For me it was a big mistake to switch from Sky to BT. BT informed me and Sky a date to switch services  but after disconnecting my broadband delayed the new connection which took them 10 days. My several plea to them to reconnect me did not produce any result. Their call centre is in India and they only give lip service. Their only explanation for the delay was ""there has been an exception"" and they just repeat this like a robot. No matter what number you dial you are always diverted to the same call centre. It is almost impossible to talk to anyone who can take some action. Out of desperation I wrote a letter to their customer services manager in UK  but have not received a reply from them either. In my view BT broadband is no different from other providers but their after sale service is very poor.~~~",plymouth~~~,2015-08-31~~~,1,1,3,3

Shame on you BT  SHAME! I originally lost our internet connection on the 21st July. I had a chat with an agent online on the 23rd July to notify them we were without broadband. They said they would look into it  send an engineer out & contact me about what was happening. I didn't hear anything back for over a week  on the 2nd August I contacted BT again. They said an engineer had been scheduled for the 6th August. I waited. After the 6th I got a message saying the problem had been fixed. But it hadn't!  After calling they said that the problem is not fixed yet & were working on it. Another week went by & no word  so I called BT. I got cut off twice. I spoke to one person & had to be transferred & then got cut off AGAIN. When I finally got to speak to someone  they said the job had been closed & no body was working on! They said they would get an engineer out to me on the 24th August. I also asked this person  and I was very clear about this  asking if I cancelled with BT today  would I be subject to any charges  cancellation fee's or do I need to give any notice for the cancellation of my account. They said no  because I was out of my BT contact fixed date. I made it very clear  regarding not only 'cancellation charges' & ANY other charges  they said no. The couldn't fix the problem on the 24th  and had to come back again on the 25th. This time  the engineer actually fixed it. But the engineered told me there was no fault and I had actually been cut off from BT broadband. He told me he didn't know how this had happened as no problems were shown with my account. I asked them if I can get compensation on top of remuneration because of being cut off & they said I will also get compensation. I got a call on Friday 28th and she was now telling me that not only would I not get any compensation  I would only get remuneration from the 2nd August as this is when she believed I first reported the fault  when in fact this was the 23rd July. I got a call back on 29th August from a was very rude agent. I asked to speak to his manager. He said he was the manager. Later it came out in he does have a manager.  Furthermore  I then found out from the cancellation team that if I cancel I will be charged £30 for discounting me from the exchange & I would need to give 30 days notice! This was not as discussed with the service team before  and I was misinformed about the process of cancellations. If they were not in a position to give information on this  they should not have advised. If I had been given the correct information in the first place  I would have said to the engineer to just keep me disconnected and we'll walk our separate ways. I also found out after checking my bill for this month I had been charged for the BT sport package.  This is something I have not requested.  I fail to understand how this was even added  when I have no internet!  I still don't know if this has been removed of my bill as they couldn't tell me.~~~,London~~~,2015-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1

Do not change houses with BT. Ever! By far the worst customer services and installation team that has ever existed. Nobody has control of the process and they will not provide any compensation for loss of broadband service when reinstalling is delayed.

We are just on standard broadband as connected directly to the exchange (95yards). Download speed is about 13mbps  so not too bad. The service dose drop out every now and then  but generally not too bad. Customer Service is time consuming  but they sort it eventually.~~~,"Chard, Somerset~~~",2015-08-27~~~,3,3,4,2
Speed is middle of the road  customer service is the worst. The whole process is actually abusive. From the long wait with the phone ringing the whole time (music anyone)  to asking the same questions repeatedly  to intentionally obfuscating the situation  to an obvious goal of getting you off the phone vs. solving the problem and ultimately succeeding because there is no alternative and no quality control. The worst of the worst in terms of customer service. average to poo in terms of quality of product.~~~,"Tarbert, Argyll~~~",2015-08-27~~~,1,1,3,2

I have never dealt with such an appalling company. They just want to squeeze the most they can out of the customer and it would appear nothing and no one can stop them.

Not impressed. All I wanted was broadband that I would enable me to surf the web  check emails. My router wouldn't even work despite BT saying It was activated  I had no service. Basically I was waiting a ridiculous length of time (almost 2 months) and was still waiting 6to 7 weeks later with no broadband. Long queues  sometimes as long as half an hour. This is how BT treats new customers. I ended up cancelling. I'd had 2 bt engineer visits  one of which BT didn't turn up at my property as someone was at home waiting for the BT engineer.~~~,denbighshire~~~,2015-08-25~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~

BT are the worst company i have ever dealt with  was looking to upgrade to infinity2 agreed price on phone e mail confirmation through wrong price wrong contract length. rang to query this was told that they could not agree this deal as it was through a third party even though it was through bt website.rang back another day after various phone calls and being fobbed off was offered a good disccounted price  no confirmation e mail came through sevearal phone calls later  including often being cut off i have been told that no order has been placed and i could not have it at discounted pricei know see that i am not alone in this and they are mis selling their products on a regular basis is this not illegal. I dont expect to have this resolved to be honest and am in a 10 month contract which i consider they cannot hold me to. final resort will be to cancel direct debit and go without internet until resolved.~~~,norfolk~~~,2015-08-23~~~,1,1,2,2

APPAULING CUSTOMER SERVICE DO NOT USE BT!!!!! Problems with billing going on for months  my quarterly bill should be around £180 (Phone & Broadband)  I received one for over £800!!! months later and over 30 (yes thirty) calls to  so called  customer service still not sorted. This is the worst experience I have EVER had of customer service  they clearly don't care and/or are completely incompetent. I regret moving to BT and will be leaving as soon as I can. Written complaint to BT and OFCOM sent. My advice AVOID at all costs!!!~~~,Bristol~~~,2015-08-22~~~,1,1,4,2
This company would appear to be institutionally incapable of living up to promises made to customers. It's customer service is by far the worst I have ever experienced. After over two hours on the phone today having been asked by BT to contact them regarding my order  I am still waiting for the answer to a simple question!! My question has now changed to 'Can you cancel my order please?'~~~,Hayle~~~,2015-08-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely terrible! Constant lies. I was with them for 1 month and lost count of the amount of calls to customer service. Every time I rang I would be on hold for a very long time and then they fob you off onto someone else and put on hold again. 1 person says the opposite to an other. I had to cancel today as I was having to ring them everyday because they messed up an order and failed to activate my service.~~~,Middlewich~~~,2015-08-21~~~,1,1,2,2
Avoid this cowboy company at all costs. Literally the worst company I've ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Had no phone or broadband for over 12 weeks now. Six engineer vists scheduled but none have ever turned up. It's getting to the point where I have no where to turn but pursue the legal route. This company are a bunch of lying con artists who do nothing to help there customers.Avoid Avoid Avoid !!!!!!~~~,Ramsey ~~~,2015-08-21~~~,1,1,1,1
I recently moved from talk talk to bt on their infinity 1 package and took the tv starter so i could get the sport channels on my tv. The transfer of the telephone line went smoothly but the broadband disconnected and didnt come back on  i waited until the following day to contact them  as i know you are advised that it can take up to midnight.When i got through the lady was very helpful  she explained there was a fault on the fibre line which is why it wasnt activated on that day. She explained that it was scheduled for 2 weeks time and she would look to expedite the date and contact me on the following monday. Unfortunately i had missed the call on the monday  so i called back in and spoke to another gentleman who told me that he could not do anything about the date and instead gave me a credit of £55.95 to cover my activation fees and the delivery of the hub.I then got a phone call from the lady on the tuesday who explained she had managed to get the date moved forward and the broadband was activated on the following day.Yes i was without broadband for 1 week but they were so helpful getting the service activated for me and ensuring i wasnt out of pocket for my troubles.When the football season started at the start of august i was made aware of the increase in the cost of sport  i had a feeling there would be a charge for the european football package  £5 i can live with.I decided to get the sports in hd on the day of the community shield and was told that i could have it free for 3 months  bonus.Since then i decided i may as well get the uhd package as i was pleased with the service ao far. £15 extra minus the £5 for aport so i am only paying £10 a month more and couldnt be happier the broadband is so much more reliable with bt. When i had talk talk i would often experience a lot of buffering during peak times and honestly ive forgotten what that feels like.~~~,blyth~~~,2015-08-20~~~,5,5,5,5
Was told by a telesales person that I could have BT infinity for £10 per month for 12 months. I signed up and found that they were going to charge me £15. On inquiring the arrogant operator told me he would have to ask for this 'complaint' to go through - it was accepted - how nice! Then I was told I would have to wait up to 17 days for a reply. Mis-selling is illegal. Rubbish BT - rubbish customer service!!! I will try elsewhere!!~~~,Bradford~~~,2015-08-20~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I very rarely post reviews of this nature but my experience today with BT has been so frustrating I want to do something in the hope BT will address their complete lack of customer service.I have been a BT customer for many years; land line and broadband. On Sat 15th August my Internet failed. I quickly ascertained from BT that I needed a new hub. This could be supplied if I renewed my contract. I agreed and the hub was due to arrive yesterday. It did not arrive and today I received a letter confirming my contract but no hub.I have today spent over three hours on the telephone  with an overseas call centre and all I have achieved is to make myself really cross. Consequently I decided to change supplier. Within less than an hour of doing this I received an e-mail asking me to reconsider with a request to call a completely different telephone number. I was also informed if I did change I would be charged almost £320 in cancellation fees. Despite the fact I cancelled within the 14 days and BT had failed to fulfil their part of the agreement. When I rang the call was answered immediately. Clearly BT respond only when they are in danger of losing business  existing customers are of no value.BT need to address the use of overseas call centres. Whilst the people who work in the centres are very pleasant they are completely ineffective.~~~,Oakham~~~,2015-08-19~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
"I have always had a reliable line  When I left my previous suppliers I had speeds of 7-8mbps. I moved to BT big mistake they never manually updated the IP profile and left me to 2mbps. Phoned them switched off the modem put it back on  of course this fixed nothing. I told the technician that their was a fault on my line 1 year ago and what the problem was. He disputed this knowing best and arranged a callback to book an open reach engineer put WTF?   I eventually didn't bother and attempted to swap back to my previous supplier with BT saying all I have to pay for is for what I used.   17th 2015 changed their mind I must pay for the full contract.   Along with this they ran tests from a department that cannot run any tests (wtf) another lie I got told is ""bt openreach is in your area upgrading your cabinet and exchange"" This one annoyed me the most they WASN'T THERE  I've been wanting fibre for a LONG TIME and attempted to use this as an excuse for rubbish speeds.

Here we go another scam of BT without knowing they added couple of package in my bills and i'm trying to contact them but there is no answer at all from their customer service .... Worst customer service~~~,London~~~,2015-08-19~~~,1,~~~,1,1
BT is the worst company (all services included) I have ever dealt with.1) the service itself is bad: in my old flat we kept having to reboot the router (several times a day) for it to work  which means the internet cut off all the time. This lasted 3 years. In my new flat  they randomly cancelled my order and my internet was activated 3 weeks after I ordered it - and I am in a flat where all the infrastructure was already installed with BT and everything worked.2) most important: horrible customer service. Every time I speak to someone new I get told different things  and they are pure lies. BT never do what they promise: they say they call you at X time on X day  that doesn't happen so you have to chase for it  then they tell you something else  which again they don't do. Now for the 3rd time I am promised a phone call to discuss my complaints and compensastion but that takes almost a week  and I am not even sure they will call. Absolutely NOT to be trusted: their service is bad and they treat customers appallingly  this is really serious.~~~,London~~~,2015-08-19~~~,1,1,3,2
"I ordered a BT Home Hub 5. It was neither despatched nor delivered but I was quickly charged £69 plus delivery. When I complained I was sold a new contract that would include a free Hub 5 and told that they would cancel the original order and refund my money. Three weeks of misery and five long phone calls later I have been promised a refund to my bank  then told I could only be refunded via my next bill. None of this has happened. The customer help staff give a different story each time and say that ""It will definitely be sorted this time."" All lies!~~~",Devon~~~,2015-08-19~~~,1,1,2,2
