Since being with BT my Download and upload speeds seem to have slowed down.~~~,Edwards~~~,2009-10-21~~~,3,4,~~~,3
I can say nothing positive about BT. I cannot wait until December when I will be free to chose new provider.~~~,west sussex~~~,2009-10-20~~~,1,1,1,1
My so called 8mb connection often runs at 75k during peak times and lately doesn't work at all at times. I live a few hundred metres from the exchange.~~~,"Hayes, Bromley~~~",2009-10-18~~~,~~~,~~~,1,~~~
Pathetic speeds!~~~,Headcorn Kent~~~,2009-10-14~~~,3,3,1,3
BT seem to consider themselves as gods. and we are the lowly mushrooms that are kept in the dark and fed..... well you know. when someone knows more than the people in the Indian call centers it causes them problems. but nothing ever gets done. an engineer may call round but all he will do is tell you the same info as your router. it is a wonder how they can justify the extra costs of their product. i think a more reliable service could be gained with a telegraph machine opperated by monkeys~~~,norfolk~~~,2009-10-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Once again BT can't live up to their advertising they can't even give me half a meg so how are they going to deliver 20meg they should not be allowed to advertise what they cant deliver to all~~~,isle of Islay~~~,2009-10-12~~~,1,4,1,1
The speed is average but drops considerably on a regular basis  far too unreliable.~~~,South East London~~~,2009-10-10~~~,3,5,~~~,1
Has never been good. BT seems to involved whoever supplies. Got better once now worse than for a long time.~~~,Gretton~~~,2009-10-09~~~,1,~~~,1,1
Low speed as opposed to the published speed ! Line check carried out and all ok. Moved router to a short direct connection to the main bt box and disconnected all other devices. Ran the speed check again and it was still low.~~~,Sunderland ( Tyne & Wear)~~~,2009-10-09~~~,~~~,1,~~~,5

Although being upgraded to the 20MB option I think BT did this network upgrade in my area before it was totally ready. This is born out by the drop in downloading speed initially  compared to my 8MB option previously.I do not like the Indian call centre for support because I cannot always understand what they are saying.Bring back call centres to this country for a customer friendly service.~~~,basingstoke~~~,2009-09-29~~~,4,4,3,4
promised a speed of 2.5-3 mbps  never had such a speed in 10 months of being with them.  The best we have had was 1.5 for 2 days  average is 500 kbps  but normally speed is between 400-30 kbps ( yes 30 kbps slower than dial up modem )speed up to the router as 8 open reach engineers will testify is 2.5 mbps  so line etc is OK  but b.t. keeps the speed low at their end.~~~,cornwall~~~,2009-09-24~~~,1,3,1,3
Dismal speed.Indian call centre.Speaks volumes.~~~,windlesham~~~,2009-09-23~~~,1,1,1,~~~
BT has to one of the worst run companys i have ever been with.  The customer service is terrible and the speeds which they say you will get are a complete lie.~~~,Cheshire~~~,2009-09-18~~~,1,1,1,1
"Its ok if nothing goes wrong  but any ""Techie"" calls go to India and the English is barely understandable - no use when trying to explain things. I was trying to get to the bottom of why I was getting a low signal but I couldn't understand what the Indians were saying and they couldn't understand me !!  Left in the lurch.~~~",Buckingham~~~,2009-09-16~~~,~~~,1,~~~,4
After 7 years of support to BT  I still  pay £26.99 per month for about 1.88Mbps download.  I have asked BT for a fixed IP address as compensation for such poor download speeds in order that I can host an exchange server  but they have declined stating I should re-sign up to a business account  but the speed may well stay the same as it is now.~~~,enfield~~~,2009-09-14~~~,1,1,1,3

My line is ADSL2+. I am 850 meters from the exchange. The internal wiring in new. I am getting 750kbps downstream.~~~,"Harrow, North London~~~",2009-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
SKY was very slow and timed out regularly and particularly in on-line auctions. This resulted in not being able to bid and losing items by the time of re-setting back. SKY also sometimes completely disappeared just leaving LAN connections and no (Big Computer Icon)Internet Connection. I joked when leaving SKY I could 'RUN FASTER' :-) The upgrade they gave me for an extra five pounds a month was no better. I did give them a chance but nothing changed. To-day I received and setup the BT hub package I ordered.It was effortless in fact all I did was connect the wiring(ADSL Filter Phone Wire and LAN wire). It is so fast 100% faster than SKY nearly 6mb to SKY's 3-4mb. I'm glad I switched to BT  a better service for less.~~~,Eaton Socon    ST NEOTS   Cambs~~~,2009-09-08~~~,5,4,5,4
very poor speeds  Dial up was faster  average speed is around 180KBps - 240 Kbps (or 0.18 -0.24Mbps). Ringing customer services gets the same responses  although we told you it would be a 4Mbps line that is a maximum and I can see you were suposed to be quicker I change that for you now. Every 6 months you ring the speed increases to 2 - 3Mbps and then slows down with in a few weeks.~~~,warrington~~~,2009-09-06~~~,1,1,1,1
They  BT   are a joke. I pay for up to 2MB per second. I get 320kbs. The service is not good  they take the micky. You are unable to speak anyone who is interested. If you complain enough the speed may improve  for a short time!~~~,YORK~~~,2009-09-06~~~,1,1,1,1
I was promised three Mb  but have never had it for more than a few minutes. For months they were replacing lines in the area  during which we seldom had more than 0.5 Mb  and many times my IP profile gets 'stuck' at 130K  and can stay down often for a week at a time  until my frantic telephoning persuades somebody to move their finger to press a button and reset it. I cannot tell you how many hours I have been on the phone.~~~,wiltshire~~~,2009-09-03~~~,1,4,~~~,1
Since competition came into our area  BT has always demanded a high price for their ASDL. Now they are around 50% cheaper without explanation  other than I can never achieve a good connection. I discovered I have been double interleaved at the node  and as very very few suppliers will ever divulge the contention ratios  I suspect I'm sharing a measly 8mbps with 500 people.~~~,"Wiltshire, UK~~~",2009-09-03~~~,3,3,~~~,4
"I have just moved over from Zen internet which was 100% reliable  but limited to 2 meg speed to BT business. I now get 120k download and trying to get any sense out of BT is utterly impossible  they have always had a reputation  but naïvely I though that they had improved. Each time I get through to them  they promise action  but each any every time they let me down. So now I'm stuck  with a ""virtual dial up connection speed"" and nowhere to turn. So dont be fooled  they were bad  they have a bad reputation and more importantly  they are still as bad as they have ever been. I would steer clear like the plague.~~~",southend on sea~~~,2009-09-02~~~,1,1,1,1

Bt should spend some of their millions doing up all their network to fibre optic  as we find out in local areas like easterhouse barlanark springburn carntyne they dont get the promised 8meg broadband we get 2 if we are very lucky last night mine dropped again to under 1 meg which is appaling as i pay the same price that other people do who get 8mb and above.~~~,durkin~~~,2009-09-01~~~,~~~,1,~~~,4

Speed check is shocking  considering I was getting a faster connection in the North of Scotland with BT. The wireless is awful Hub V1. I live in a small 3 bedroom house and my playstation 3 cannot connect when downstairs as hub is upstairs~~~,"Tattershall, Lincolnshire~~~",2009-08-28~~~,~~~,3,1,~~~
BT have always tried hard to help me  but am faced with speed problems which do not seem to get cured.I am aware being in the country speed can be a big issue  but problem speed has been the main issue for some time.~~~,Albourne West Sussex~~~,2009-08-28~~~,3,4,~~~,4
Although I am grateful that we have broadband the speed jumps around like crazy.Some times of the day and weekend you could pull it with a piece of string between your teeth faster.It makes gaming almost impossible.Almost as bad as dial-up.~~~,stoke golding~~~,2009-08-25~~~,1,1,1,1

I'm paying for up to 8mb per per second  I should be getting about 4.8mbps as that what the line currently supports and a BT engineer has confirmed this.For the last couple of weeks I've been watching my service disintegrate before my eyes and despite countless call to BT's support line  nothing's changed. I've swapped out my router  my cables and my filters  no change. my latest test results  download speed of 0.27 mbps and upload speed of 0.29 mbs are about average for the last couple of weeks  although my download speed has been down as far as 0.06mbps! The only reason I've rated the service as very poor is that I can't rate them any worse.~~~,Oxford~~~,2009-08-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Problem has been ongoing for about 7 weeks. Underground work needs to be carried out. I was told it had been carried out but it is supposedly being carried out today. They told me lies and broadband speeds are pathetic - 332kbbs download 328 kbps upload.Would not recommend BT.~~~,Burtonwood~~~,2009-08-21~~~,~~~,~~~,1,1
