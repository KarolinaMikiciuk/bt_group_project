If they offer you a special deal  such as infinity without having to pay the £60 connection fee  don't believe the liars. I got this offer WAS billed for it. Rang them up a week before the bill was due to go out of my account. They agreed that the money was not owing. Nevertheless the thieves still took the original money from the account  promising a credit sometime in the future. I have heard those kind of fibs before. Crooks.~~~,WIGAN~~~,2017-07-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
As I wasmoving house on 25.07.2017  I contacted BT on 23.06.2017 to arrange to transfer my phone line and broadband to my new address. The person to whom I spoke was very helpful  I was informed that both the phone line and broadband would be switched on 25.07.2017  and the order was confirmed in an email within a few minutes of our conversation.After about two weeks I began to receive phone calls and text messages from a succession of BT employees  the effect of which was that there were supposedly problems which were going to delay the change-over of my service. They were non-specific about timescales but it was clear that weeks of delay would be involved. Each person to whom I spoke was very reluctant to explain what the problem was. They disclaimed knowledge of the 23.06.2017 order. They use terminology which frankly is gibberish  but which is clearly intended to confuse and make customers believe that some really serious problem has arisen. When I pressed for an explanation  I was given a variety of excuses  leading to the clear impression that they were simply making it up as they went along. BT's communications with me continue to be designed to confuse rather than assist  and the timeline on my on-line account does not reflect the reality of what actually happened. I am therefore thoroughly dissatisfied with BT and do not feel that I can deal with them on any basis of trust. If it was possible to rate their customer service and my overall satisfaction with a minus number  I would do so.~~~,North Berwick~~~,2017-07-31~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
BEWARE Beware Beware After 2 months they will increase your bill. And there's nothing you can do about it.  If you are desperate enough to go with this filthy company  and don't want to listen to anyone's advice. RECORD your telephone calls. Also Beware of the CESSATION CHARGE!!!!!   They won't tell you about it until  you want to leave then slap £32  when you want to switch provider..   Advise if your already in a contract with BT and are trying to leave them. Tell them you live in Hull  because they cannot provide services to Hull therefore cannot charge the CESSATION charge.      I will never ever go with this company or any other company affiliated with BT.  Libby Bar and the rest of the cronies should of been sacked a long time ago~~~,Runcorn~~~,2017-07-30~~~,1,1,2,2
BT promise 'up to' 17 Mbps. Speeds can reach between 14 and 16 Mbps during the day but in the evening  when we need it most  it drops to between 4 and 5. I see BT has promised the government it can provide 10Mbps for the whole of the country. BT are as slippery as hell and will take their measurement at the time most people are asleep and in their beds. You cannot trust BT to be truthful.~~~,Devon~~~,2017-07-30~~~,1,1,2,1
Speeds testing download at about 32-36 when working but frequently drops out for several minutes at a time every day. I have an Infinity connection now (copper from green box)but no better than when I had the cheap broadband-it has been dropping out for years. The only testing ever done by BT is on the phone lines with resistance and capacitance testing but they never test the Broadband and then declare it OK and want to charge me for the visit!~~~,ct10 3ng~~~,2017-07-29~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Less than Uessless we have been waiting on basic broadband to be connected for 7 weeks and been given 8 dates with all being a no show. The house had broadband 3 months ago so must be a simple matter of turning it back on but no not for bt and open reach who now say we can't have broadband at our house. Every other house in the street and terrace has it. I am not happy about the way they treat there customers. Very poor worst company I have dealt with in a long time.  Don't use bt if you can.~~~,South uist~~~,2017-07-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Months have gone by  no broadband. I am racking up huge bills on the BT mobile. Which? rated this as UKs worst broadband and for good reason. No service for months and they want to charge me £450 for leaving when in fact contract obligations have not been fulfilled by BT and therefore the contract should be terminated. I spend hours daily chasing them around the world. Its a disgrace for a company to care so little about their customers and just leave them for months without contact or call backs. Never again~~~,Cheshire~~~,2017-07-26~~~,1,1,2,1
Initially when I started service with BT  it kept going off everyday for a month and when I called BT  the customer service guy tells me that this is normal and happens with every customer. I replied saying  that's a very promising service you are giving (sarcastically) and it kept going on and off through out the year. However  I had to move houses before my end of contract  I called them to ask the charges for early termination and I was told  it would be cheaper to continue contract until end of it rather than cancelling it now  hearing that  I decided to continue until end of contract  but within a week  an email was sent to me saying  your broadband has been cancelled and you will be charged £ 110 ! getting a shock  I called BT services and they kept telling me they had sent me an email that someone else would take over your line (even though there was no communication) Eventually  after loads of arguments  it was decided they would refund me everything as they couldn't provide services in my new house. And here i'm 15 days after refund processing  I still haven't received any refund.  Probably I would never go for BT Services again in my life .Worst customer service.  If I could  I would give a negative rating.~~~,MK~~~,2017-07-26~~~,1,1,3,1
Beware of all BT charges  transparency Recently advised BT the required 30 days’ notice (not to renew) prior to the renewal date (late August 2017) of the 12 month fibre optic broadband contract. Although this contract will end after the 12 month contractual period (no early cancellation)  I still have to pay the £31 charge for stopping BT broadband  the cessation fee. On commencement of the contract BT charged for broadband setup  router postage amounting to £56.95 (disclosed and transparent). Normal monthly broadband charges apply (disclosed and transparent) This cessation charge of £31 was not transparent and mentioned when I took the service 12 months ago and was only brought to my attention when I decided not to renew the BT broadband contract. Ofcom should enforce that all charges associated with a broadband contract (upfront and cessation charges) are clearly highlighted/disclosed and made transparent in all marketing information by relevant companies offering such services.~~~,Brighton~~~,2017-07-26~~~,3,2,4,4
People beware  while their initial offer may see great  they do not hesitate in increasing your monthly costs  give you terrible broadband service  take money for something you do not receive and then state you must renew your contract in order for you to continue the support on their equipment.  There are better services out there and would deter anyone from using BT. Too expensive  lie to the customers and basically steal money without consent.  Your choice  but please look at other reviewers  we cannot all be wrong can we?~~~,Lancashire~~~,2017-07-25~~~,1,2,1,1

Don't trust them  I negotiated a deal for 12 months  two months later they upped all the prices  I complained and they simply hid behind the small print  disreputable and dishonest is my view of them  worst of the broadband suppliers  it's about time these long contractual tie ins were made illegal~~~,Lichfield~~~,2017-07-23~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
Overall satisfaction? Disgrace. It took 3 months for us to get up and running  multiple engineer appointments whereby the engineer never turned up. Passed between several case managers who failed to deliver on their promises. Tricked into contract extensions. Mis-sold. Fobbed off by their customer services who claim there is no manager. I'm concerned for any business with no manager! No adherence to OFCOM or Ombudsman rights in their call centre. Internet speed is bang average. But not worthwhile given the horrible customer service and inefficient tech support and engineers. I cannot wait for Virgin to offer their services to all of NI  not just Belfast  because BT will be annihilated. And that's what they deserve in 2017.~~~,Belfast~~~,2017-07-22~~~,1,1,2,2
Complete and utter horsecrap. Can't go one hour without complet spikes and lags and disconnections on whatever I am on. PC  gaming console and even my phone. Terrible.~~~,London~~~,2017-07-22~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The most appalling customer service ever. Our (always slow) broadband crashed during a thunderstorm. We made approx 20 to 30 calls  plus using online customer service. The engineer didn't show up on 2 consecutive days  despite us being told he was booked in. Online service told us it was the fault of our (brand new) router & that it was 'out of warranty'. 4 days work lost  still no solution. Utterly complacent company. Next week we're changing provider.~~~,Hertfordshire ~~~,2017-07-22~~~,1,1,2,2
I have been a BT customer for 23 years  never really had to complain. However if you are considering getting the infinity 2 service let me share my woes with you and perhaps save you a) some money and b) a whole load of stress. So Sept 2015 I upgraded from infinity to infinity 2 – THE fibre optic network  so they told me. Speeds of 80 Meg! Up load speeds in excess of 20 meg and down load speeds of 75+meg. From day one slower than my previous speeds. With one or two occasions where it preformed as per contract. Using the Speed test on this page – I began logging the speeds to report back to BT – a few months later  when I was ready – I presented the findings – First off BT refused to accept the data collected using the speed test on this page  - so I had  to use the BT Wholesale test. Interesting that it gave me about a 10-20% difference in it’s favour against the one here... So trying to get BT to sort it out was just so frustrating – First off Billing and Delivery will bat you between the both of the groups detailing it is not their problem. Eventually you will get some overworked person in their call centre in Mumbai  who will try and at least give you some proper customer service. Sadly they will fail. If like me you get frustrated enough to flag it to the ombudsman here is where they get you. First off  their contract is written in such a way  you – as the customer do not have a leg to stand on. You are dealing with a company within a company. BT will front the deal  however it will be delivered through Openreach and that is where the first frustration starts. The contract then goes on to state that if they deliver ANY service/speed in their books they are delivering service and under the code of practice that is good enough  as they are still delivering a service  therefore you as the customer cannot complain and should you call them out to ‘check’ the line – you will be presented with a further £120 call out charge (IF the engineer does turn up). So  if you like a service that states 80 meg and you pay for an 80 Meg service  yet are happy to have half of that as a minimum  then sign up to the Infinity 2 service  which when one goes out of contract will only get worse! Do not listen to their customer services – they tell untruths. I was supposedly meant to have my bill suspended pending investigation. They turned my service off  battered my credit rating  gave no contact details and finally presented me with a final reminder stating all sorts of pain and suffering through the courts. Once you are cut off from BT they will only give you recoded messages telling you they will only deal with you once you have settled your bill – the loop of frustration. No human interaction until your bill is settled. The Ombudsman services have done the best they can – and against an 18 month bill of over £580 paying for their 80 Meg service and receiving less than half the speeds. I got £10 for non turn up of engineer and a ‘Good Will’ gesture of ...£50! Do yourself a favour and only consider BT as a last ditched attempt to service. Yes after 23 years  I will be moving all my services away from them – Customer service is a word branded about by BT  but frankly I am not sure they know what it means.~~~,Beaconsfield~~~,2017-07-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Sould be zero stars for speed and reliability. Have had issues the whole 12 months of our contract. Getting 1.5Mbps (on a good day) when we should be getting 25-27Mbps  usually not a good enough connection to watch BT sport's so we're paying £60 a month for nothing! Have had technician/engineer visit  house wiring tested  replaced router  all the while having an unusable connection for approximately 6 months straight. If you can  please  for your own sake avoid BT.~~~,London~~~,2017-07-21~~~,1,2,1,1

Absolute shambles  with just some of the problems being:* Before I signed up I was told I'd be able to transfer the contract to someone else  which later turned out to be rubbish I was subsequently told that I'd first have to pay off the contract which entirely defeats the point.* I was told to wait in for the engineer to set everything up  and only to find out after the timeslot (when I called to find out where the engineer was) that it wasn't actually required thus wasting a day of holiday.* The connection itself would randomly die and take a long time to sort itself.* Whenever I called about problems with the connection I was fobbed off with excuses  with nothing ever resolved or any of the callbacks actually done.* The router itself was awful  and sometimes took over an hour (which I timed) to restart.* There were various hidden charges  such as setting up the phone line  removing it  an extortionate fee for the sub-standard router.* The price was increased early on in the contract  with the (legally required) notification email either never being sent or being buried in so much spam from BT that no one had any hope of seeing it.* The customer support is inconsistent  which different people telling you different things.* I asked to end the contract early as I moved house  but once this was done was then told that I'd be charged extra. I was also then told AFTER I'd cancelled it that these charges would not be applied if I'd just let the contract expire  but by this point it was apparently too late. I'd recommend people to use ANYTHING but BT.~~~,London~~~,2017-07-19~~~,1,1,2,1
absolutely useless the speed is clearly incorrect as it is constantlyfreezing. When you use a normal line speed test it is very very low and then BT knows you have done it on their line speed so they speed your broadband up. Just proves they can control your line speed and are annoying you on purpose~~~,mountain ash~~~,2017-07-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Useless company. Asked to connect my house when I was abroad a month in advance. Arrived at home to find a letter asking me to confirm installation date. You couldn't make it up  an internet company sending a letter asking for confirmation to connect your broadband. So I had to wait 10 days for them to connect it.Then after a year I moved house   the dates changed and I gave them 12 days notice that I wished to move the date to 5 days in advance of the original one. Come the original day I'd set and they disconnected me 5 days before our move and would not reconnect me. Disgraceful company. Avoid at all cost.~~~,London~~~,2017-07-18~~~,1,1,1,1

BT is totally rubbish they just get you in by saying that they best broadband but not their broadband is average and through out your contract they keep increasing the price  their customer service is absolutely rubbish advisors don't even understand the pricing themselves adding things on when you call they say we have sent you email about all price  why not explain them when people call. In my opinion everybody who reads my review don't go with them or at least make sure %100 of everything don't go on their word!~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-07-15~~~,1,1,3,2
The worst experience i have had in regards to broadband and customer service  still left without broadband connection 2 weeks after the original connection date and still no end in sight. Constantly fobbed off with excuses and false dates as to when i will have internet connection  i would never advise using BT as a broadband provider and will certainly never go near then again!~~~,"Cannock, Staffordshire~~~",2017-07-14~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I believe BT as a company borders on the criminal. Their system is to manipulate their customers into believing you are their no 1 priority but this could not be further from the truth. I was coerced into signing a new contract with BT in order to get a new router and and fix the ongoing very poor broadband which constantly drops out. Once the contract was signed there was no end of excuses and mistakes made by BT until I ran out of patience and am now having to take legal proceedings against them. They are without  doubt the worst company I have ever dealt with and do not recommend anyone updating their contracts. As long as BT has a monopoly on the lines we as customers will continue to face this nightmare situation of dealing with bt!~~~,Nutley~~~,2017-07-13~~~,1,2,1,1

Over a year of slow speeds less than 1 MB often can't even load basic web pages although can watch streaming movies at times as well to be fair. Best speed about 1.5 MB. We're paying £40 A month for this trickle of internet that other users with the same company are getting 17 MB ??? Leaving to go with a company half the price. Have had some really good experience with customer services it's not the individuals fault the company policies are responsible for customer satisfaction.

Overall appalling. Upload speed is horrific  as is download speed. Connection on my console (PS4) is even worse. Can't even watch a video without it having to buffer every 3 seconds. Phoned up and apparently it is an issue on our end in which it is not  then called and said it was fixed which it clearly was not. Absolutely shocked with this and the worse provider to ever go with. 10/10 DO NOT recommend for anyone. Go with sky/virgin  a bit more expensive but at least you actually get what you are paying for.~~~,Grangemouth ~~~,2017-07-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband slower than my 4G. Had mobile  broadband and BTSport. I canceled BT broadband due to them doubling my mobile bill over 800mb of data. To which they tried holding bt sport over my head saying that would go from 5 pound to 30 poind with no broadband. Go I just cancelled everything.  They basically gove you second rate broadband and you keep it for the cheap sports and mobile offers.  Bt Mobile deals do not meet the requirement of modern cusomers either.
