Just Diabolical  We have went through 6 hubs all of them undoubtedly terrible. So i live in the country side  a few miles outside Ballymena and bt is terrible. Is funny (not really) because all bt want is money. It used to be i could have my phone  laptop and Xbox on the wifi and it would still be strong but one day as promised bt said they’d put fibre opic in the area we were super excited but all they did was slowed all our wifis down to crawling speed and the only way to speed it up to what it used to be is by buying fibre opic which is an extra £25 pounds a month (we already pay £35) hate bt and when i grow up (im 15) im gettin sky or something better because bt is terrible in every way would say about the other points above but i dont wanna bor you~~~,Outside Ballymena~~~,2018-08-08~~~,1,1,1,1
By absolutely rubbish - current download speed 0.6 mb just not good enough for anything and spending £75 a month for nothing!! Total waste of money!do not use BT.~~~,STOCKPORT~~~,2018-08-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Continuous problems with BT including overcharging  deal issues  terrible customer service  etc. Just been cut off after waiting on another complaints call for 30 mins before anybody picked up. AVOID BT or risk spending 10+ hours per year on the phone to them.~~~,UK~~~,2018-08-07~~~,1,1,3,3
Out of contract and moving home I reluctantly paid bt’s extortionate month by month costs before finding a better service elsewhere so cancelled the dd at my bank. My bank then informed bt and I got the expectedofficious call to ‘investigate’ why. I informed them then on the phone I wanted nothing more to do with them and  cancelled. Big mistake doing it verbally as bt maliciously kept my account open! That was two months ago and I am still receiving threatening demands for money I cannot afford and with no written proof I cancelled am subject to continuing extortion.. threatening language in their emails escalating despite attempts to sort it out  humanely; the nasty Corp bullying lying fascists! If I don’t submit and pay what they demand I face debt collectors and reporting to credit agencies! Charming BT!~~~,Derbyshire ~~~,2018-08-07~~~,1,1,3,3
Appalling service..They 'conned' us into a further 18 contract while we still had 6 months to go on our original contract.Didn't find out until we decided to leave...Then they wanted £200 penalty.~~~,Hereford~~~,2018-08-06~~~,1,2,4,3
"BT provide the most atrocious  awful  poor  unacceptable  unsatisfactory and the worst and most terrible internet ever. I have been with many different internet providers and BT of all services has absolutely shocked me with how godawful their service is. BT say they are supposedly and I quote ""the most best and fastest internet provider"" out of all the internet providers in the UK. Well if you as the public people want a real and honest answer then here it is. BT are such false advertisers and it is completely ripped off the internet for over 1 whole year now has been turning itself on and off every 1 minute so for every 5 minutes our internet switches itself on and off about 20+ times and that is completely ridiculous they do not provide any satisfactory customer service whatsoever and I say their company and everything else is a complete failure to themselves and to me  my family and everyone else who is still with then at the moment because I don't know if anyone else is having too many issues to count but if so don't be shy at all to speak out because I am no longer staying with with dread nightmare awful and absolutely God dam horrendous service any more i get more data from my ee data plan (4g) so that says it all. Thank you for my service.~~~",Birmingham United Kingdom ~~~,2018-08-05~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is quite inefficient. I cannot access my billing. Whenever I want a new password the activation  code will not come with email open. The BT page will not work on top of open email. Basic inefficiency.~~~,Clapham South West London~~~,2018-08-04~~~,2,1,2,2
Promised £140 mastercard voucher advertised as part of the deal never arrived. Online customer support chat system is rubbish. Landline charges are insane. They increased charges within one month of me signing the contract. Broadband sync speed shown on the router is less than 1/3rd of the “guaranteed” speed. Totally uncompetitive product and service which they can only get away with because they are the default landline supplier. Please avoid. I used to be a Virgin customer and although not perfect they were WAY better than BT.~~~,London~~~,2018-08-03~~~,1,1,2,4
Poor service as even when I complained I was told a manager will call me . Never received a a call back . Never received refund for the days I did not have the broadband service and this has happened three times despite promises. Now thinking of moving to Virgin as they have their own lines as they do not rent BT lines  . Will challenge the end of the contract if need be and welcome feedback from anyone who is on the same situation. BT should not threaten people that they have to pay for the full contract if they can’t deliver the service and this needs to be decided in a court of law .~~~,Ilford~~~,2018-08-02~~~,1,1,1,1
I strongly NOT recommend BT.I’m BT user for 6 mounts and I’m very disappointed. The internet is very unreliable. My smart Hub restarts almost every day and even the TV channels stops sometime. I was watching F1 Stonehenge and I missed half of the race  I was really pissed off. Beside that I supposed to get BT gift card with £120 on it. I assumed I will receive by post or I will get email for any info  after few mounts when I asked them the response was my card expired. I had 90 day to claim but nobody told me  due to I didn’t I lost my gift. That was one of the reasons why I switched to BT. Firs time on BT and definitely last!!!~~~,Swindon~~~,2018-07-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely awful. I switched from now tv and have been without broadband for 3 weeks and counting. I'm also having to phone daily to keep things moving. I am extremely regretful of ever switching to BT. They have been the worst isp I've ever had the misfortune to use.~~~,Kinross~~~,2018-07-31~~~,1,1,1,1
I utterly resent using these people. I am paying 45 a month for 8mb download and that has been completely unreliable on a daily basis  I have so many calls logged each time after a few weeks the service drops back to unusable. This all resulted after moving  in their defence BT was ok at my previous address. BT as a company should not be granted the monopoly to dictate our internet infrastructure as we are clearly falling behind our competitors in Europe  whilst they make more and more money. You are a disgrace BT and all the directors involved.~~~,WIMBORNE~~~,2018-07-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Literally the WORST customer service I have experienced in my 32 years of life. Ordered broadband on 5 July (it’s currently 31 July) after the IT team cancelled my appointment to set up my internet WITHOUT my knowledge the team couldn’t figure out why the broadband wasn’t working  so after 4 calls and 72 hours of waiting between each call  they set up a service tech appointment. The tech never showed up. After I called  the CS rep said they couldn’t do anything until 24 hours had passed after the missed appointment  at that point they could reschedule!  This company is an absolute joke.~~~,Red Lodge~~~,2018-07-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible and horrible. Never again. Do not use BT internet~~~,London~~~,2018-07-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Left BT years ago.  Went to Sky but found badly affected by the weather so moved house and changed to Virgin.  Price doubled at end of contract so was recommended to BT.  Have a bundle and nothing but problems.  TV channel choice is rubbish. You absolutely have to have unlimited broadband to operate properly despite being told basic package would be fine.  Sometimes you get someone who knows what they are talking about  but generally you get an idiot who cannot solve an issue and just makes it up as they go along. Bitterly regret returning to BT as  if anything  worse than it used to be and now stuck with a long contract.~~~,Iver~~~,2018-07-29~~~,1,1,1,2
I believe I have had one of the worst experiences with BT. They increase prices without notice although I was guaranteed a price for a certain time period  I need to restart the router quite often to get a decent speed although theoretically I have 50mb infinity 1 broadband and live in central London. I will change suppliers now as my experience with them is just bad and not worth the hassle.~~~,London~~~,2018-07-29~~~,1,2,2,1
Do not use BT.Had nothing but issues with them from the start.They constantly put up prices too.Every time there is an issue I have to call them so many times and even then it’s not sorted out. They recently sent me a free upgrade on broadband hub but didn’t tell me they’ve restarted a 24 month contract. Shocking company. From January 19 I’ll be paying £50 per month until July 2020. If I cancel the contract I’ll have to pay. When I query anything they have said they say we informed you which they DID NOT otherwise I wouldn’t have accepted the FREE upgrade. I definywould not recommend BT!~~~,Hertfordshire ~~~,2018-07-29~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Our broadband has suddenly become much slower even though WE have not changed anything.  It's gone from 4.5 mb  to 1.2 mb in our area so we can no longer watch any channelling the iplayer.  I think BT stinks!!!!!~~~,Chesterton Peterborough~~~,2018-07-28~~~,2,1,1,2
Being a customer of BT is a condemnation to a torturous experience. If I had to choose between using BT or returning to the dark days of no Internet connection  I may as well choose the latter because they are essentially the same thing but I don't have to pay money for the 2nd option.~~~,"Campsea Ashe, Woodbridge~~~",2018-07-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Pay nearly a hundred pound a month for this and can’t even play one console game without disconnecting  rediculous and we even have been sent multiple routers.~~~,Thornton-clevelys ~~~,2018-07-25~~~,1,1,1,1
ABSOLUTE TRASH. the slowest wifi ever. 27 kb/s  is the worst. had an engineer out and didnt help one bit. The first engireer also didnt show up. Abominable and horrendous service and wifi. I think you should stop providing wifi and go away. No one should ever use your services and save their money. Plusnet is better than u. Screw u bt~~~,England ~~~,2018-07-25~~~,1,1,1,1
All OK for the first couple of years - just one major outage that lasted for two days. BUT...last 12 months has been totally unreliable...last month absolutely unusable at times with slow speeds and drop outs many times each day. They keep insisting that there are no external problems in my area when I know for a  fact that many others in South Birmingham have similar issues + the industry watchdogs have logged dozens of outages with BT Broadband. Virgin Media here I come!~~~,BIRMINGHAM~~~,2018-07-22~~~,2,2,3,1
Within a few months of signing up for an 18 month fixed 35 pound a month contract  the fee began rising. Eventually within 12 months that cost had risen to 50 pound. I spoke to their call centre about this where I was belittled  laughed at and told I was in contract so couldn't change without fees. The speed as advertised was fast  but the customer service was atrocious and unacceptable.  I do not wish to subsidise their ridiculous football package options and rural BB customers so have decided to go elsewhere for half of the price and the same BB speed.~~~,Portsmouth~~~,2018-07-21~~~,2,1,4,4
Honestly  the broadband speed isn't that bad  but what makes BT so disappointing is the customer service and reliability. BT worked fine until about a year ago when it started cutting off for no reason. I've contacted BT and they said nothing is wrong with it. I only have 1 regret and that is staying with BT for this long. If you are looking for a good broadband  go to virgin... I would suggest against getting BT.~~~,Slough~~~,2018-07-20~~~,1,1,3,1
Internet kept dropping out and i Spent months on the phone to them to be fobbed off and passed on saying they've found a fault but arnt sure what it is had engineers booked and cancelled without being informed so took a unpaid day off work for nothing they have no interest in fixing anything and have said I'm entitle to no compensation because it isn't total loss of internet it's only intermittent but what use is internet if it only works for 5 minutes then disconnects for 5 minutes and so on this is the worst broadband I've ever had and as for the call centres being up based what a load of manure this company should be called Indian telecom~~~,Ashington~~~,2018-07-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Don’t use BT!!!!!!Ordered online a deal  in a week time checked my account and got message that my order has been cancelled. Contact BT and I’ve been told that reason is not visible and been suggested to reordered. Went online and Booooom reason for cancellation appears on my screen same offer £6 higher!!!!!!!!! Called them again explained  but nothig offer is diferent Sorry~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2018-07-19~~~,1,1,~~~,1
Absolute nightmare organisation.  No communication between any of the staff and up to 6 calls per day from representatives saying the same things over and over again!  I believe they have an automated system which cant be switched off and they can only put notes on their system which  obviously  nobody reads. Many of the calls can not understand what you are saying which makes it impossible to have a conversation.  They just repeat the same thing over and over again. Quite oblivious to customer service and will blatantly say you are a liar when you explain what the other represented said.   God knows how this company manages to survive - i certainly would never use them again ~~~,Knowsley~~~,2018-07-19~~~,1,1,2,2
BT are by 100 miles the absolute worst Phone and Broadband supplier it has ever been my misfortune to deal with!They have a service contract Leadtime of 14 days to reconnect an account to the exchange when you move house. It takes nothing effort wise to carry out this work and yet they insist on doing it through their (non official) side kick company Openreach. Two price increases in 6 months and they don't have the resources available to connect a long standing customer on the same day.Broadband is everything  without it you are dead in the water when you most need it after moving house.  Shame on you BT  one day hopefully you will be nationalised again as all country infrastructure should be so it works for the good of the people and not fat cat salaries to people that could not manage themselves let along BT  look at Italy  how many of those fat cats had their eye on the ball? Answers on a postcard. All profit should be fully invested back into the countries infrastructure  that way we would not still have copper pair connections into many houses still  but fibre everywhere  most 3rd world countries outperform the UK in terms of their infrastructure and that is because BT have done nothing with the billions of pounds they have made over many years  other than pay ever higher salaries and shareholders!~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2018-07-19~~~,1,1,2,1
if it works the speed is in line with other providers but it only works 50% of the time~~~,BIRMINGHAM~~~,2018-07-18~~~,~~~,~~~,2,~~~
Absolutely appalling service! Please do not use BT! Had to wait 2 months for the Broadband to be installed without any communicating or updates from BT  I had to do all the chasing and challenging to ensure that we eventually got internet at all! We were passed from pillar to post each time we rang customer services and each time promised that the issues would be solved-each time we were left disappointed. To further the disappointing experience that we’ve had with BT  after the broadband was installed  we received numerous bills stating that we owed them money and adding unpaid bill charges onto our account. When I set up the account originally I had added a direct debit which was being taken out of our account  so was baffled as to why I was receiving fines when I had been paying the bills. After having to call BT again to sort this issue out I discovered that they’d actually set up two accounts in my name and where trying to charge us for both of those accounts-one that I was paying for by direct debit and the other one that they were sending us bills for! I couldn’t believe the incompetence and sheer cheek! They apologised and said that they would reimburse us and sort out accounts so that there was only one. A week later….we received another bill-again adding fines for not paying! An on-going joke! Ironically  we went with BT as they are a well-established company who we thought would be good at dealing with any issues: an absolute untruth! Just awful!~~~,Riding Mill~~~,2018-07-18~~~,1,1,1,1
I had to get BT as virgin is not in my area. Worst bradband speed and customer experience ever. 4mb download and 0.5mb upload on a 38mb package witch is a lot slower than the 200mb virgin bb i had. 4 different excuses as to the fault. Hung up on by advisor twice. Engineer never tur ed up. Then told me the fault was fixed when it clearly isn't. As soon as virgin are in my area bye bye BT. You are 10 years behind and the customer service are horrendous and ill advised and I suspect no IT eduction in any way. Probably read from a script.~~~,Greenock~~~,2018-07-16~~~,1,1,1,1
"I was with BT for 12 months customer service was not always hepful usual answer was ""It's working okay our side""   they advertise as being customer orientated but in truth no better than some others and mt broadband kept dropping out and was slow even though i wax on tge fastest fibre~~~",Staffordshire~~~,2018-07-16~~~,3,2,2,~~~
"Left BT many years ago due to atrocious customer service. Took up their offer of faster stronger broadband and also signed up for BT Sport. The broadband promise never materialized  I still don`t have BT Sport due an unidentified technical fault and when I attempt to speak to someone then its either a long wait to speak to someone or a chat with someone who`s handling a number of clients at the one time and is untrained and keeps saying I`ll be right with you in two minutes but inevitably can`t help you because ""that`s dealt with by a different team"" etc etc etc but they`ll be with you in two minutes etc etc etcBT customer service has deteriorated from atrocious to mega atrocious. Don`t go near BT unless you have a bottle of wine and some valium to hand and time to spare.~~~",GLASGOW~~~,2018-07-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Have had problems about 1 month ago when broadband was dropping ...got through to Dublin almost straight away and they found out it was a problem at their end. Worked OK for a month then dropping again ...got through to Dublin again...after checking - it was a problem at our end- identified as the very old Hub2. We received a new Hub4 by post the next day.~~~,Bristol~~~,2018-07-15~~~,3,4,2,4
Absolutely unpredictable and unreliable internet connection  keeps dropping off. The customer service is shocking and they are either clueless or deny any problems. I will never use BT internet again in my life nor reccommend to anyone.~~~,Leicester~~~,2018-07-14~~~,1,1,1,1
My internet drops out constantly  I never get to do anything for 20 minutes until the internet suddenly goes off and I have to restart my router. This is the worst!~~~,No~~~,2018-07-14~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Customer service is absolutely appalling.Numerous phone calls to many people who have no idea what they are talking about.They disconnected my broadband but apparently were unaware on whatever system they were claiming to be looking at.Then they booked an engineer who was in no position to undo the handy work of whatever genius decided to disconnect me.Last of all I was told that if I wanted to reconnect I would have to enter a new contract.A horrendous experience of going completely offline for weeks with nobody capable of sorting it out.Never again BT  and to think how many hundreds of millions of public money this company pocketed.~~~,Scotland~~~,2018-07-12~~~,1,1,1,1
I ordered Fibre Broadband on 20th April  was booked in for 22nd May... nobody turned up. Was re-booked for 11th June  engineers turned up but it turns out they was going to supply it wrong address... was re-booked for July 4th  i rang on 2nd July to confirm they was coming.... nobody turned up !! Was then told it was being put in on the 12th July... Only to be told this afternoon it isn't being done now until 17th July. Cancelled my order... useless doesn't even start to describe how utterly rubbish BT are... For a large communications company  it doesn't bode well when you can't even communicate between your own departments... Almost 3 months and still no service. Absolute disgrace !!~~~,Cornwall~~~,2018-07-11~~~,1,1,1,1
The difficulty of setting up service from BT is an extraordinary experience.Having received a14 page letter advising me of procedures benefits and the usual administration policies  l waited on the advised day  after cancelling work to accommodate the arranged visit.The 5 hour slot for the engineer reached halfway  after -which I spent 40 minutes on  the phone to ascertain thelikelihood of an appearance. Having been given 2 order numbers  the result of the confusion was that my order was cancelled because of a systems failure. Unable to give any indication as to whenan engineer could be organised - because the system would not allow it - I asked to speak to the line-manager who unsurprisingly was “not on floor”.I now wait with eager anticipation for the next instalment of ‘Systems Are Us’.As  a communication company BT can only stand for BloodyTerrible.~~~,Cambridge ~~~,2018-07-10~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Been with BT for many years now  only ever had one drop out in all that time.  BT told me my broadband/phone line bill will increase from £36.99 to £45.50 a month in September.I phoned their customer services and spoke to a lovely Lancashire lass who dropped the price increase plus a further discount.Now paying less than I was a week ago.Well pleased!~~~,Essex~~~,2018-07-10~~~,5,5,5,5
