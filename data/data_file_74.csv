"Circa £45pm worst customer service received ever! Rude and swearing so tried to speak to a manager ""Nothing I can do"" you have to write a letter which they do not reply to! Took £50 of calls to cancel the broadband and phone which was already disconnected wasn't to bad only cost me a further £45 plus £50 disconnection fee so £145 and a week of stress on the phone. Never again will I ever use a product and will warn anyone reading this BEWARE BT!!!!~~~",Portsmouth~~~,2014-07-04~~~,1,~~~,1,3
complained to BT stating slow broadband speed.  They sent an engineer who decided best way to improve speed was to disconnect bedroom phone line.  He did this and left telling me he had also contacted the office and they would boost the power.  I am now without bedroom phone £125 lighter for his services and still rubbish download speed and dodgy hub that you have to turn on and off twice before the blue lights come on.~~~,"Takeley, Bishops Stortford~~~",2014-07-03~~~,1,1,1,1

I have ordered the BT Infinity 2 package. The BT engineer did not turn up and their customer service person was really rude with his 'Im sorry but this is not our fault' and I can wait another 2 weeks+ for the engineer - and even than he cannot guarantee that they will show up...That is the best he can do! Real time waster and cannot believe that this sort of trading is allowed. They hold me as a hostage now as Im still within a contract with my phone line and it is quite expensive to break the contract (£96 I think they said). Nice one BT! I could rant forever but hey ho - lets move on and take my customs somewhere else and leave as many negative reviews all over the internet instead :) I cannot comment on the actual speed and reliability of service (for obvious reasons) so gave them an estimated 1 star (expected average :)~~~,Surrey~~~,2014-07-01~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT broadband for years. I have yet to be satisfied with the service and they have the worst customer service ever known to man. They employ non English speaking customer service operators who can not even get your name right! The broadband is very unreliable and drops out for days at a time. There is never any offer of compensation either.My opinion:-DO NOT USE BT BROADBAND.Simples!~~~,Gloucestershire~~~,2014-06-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I moved from Virgin to BT about 4 years ago  everything was fine then I upgrade to infinity and my problems started ok I live very near to exchange so when my Broadband works I get 55 - 60 mb download speeds but it never stays consistent it continually drops off  consistent complaining to BT found it was my BT Vision box as it is hard wired when it downloads or updates it stops the Wifi signal hence drop off on ipad .. Apple TV .. Laptop etc !! If you can ask them to upgrade to the newer youview box (don't pay for it) also check what else you have plugged into your hub it may also be affecting when updating .. So not all bad but service is still shocking ... And probably I will be back on the phone to BT soon when the you view box starts to develop faults !!!~~~,Cardiff~~~,2014-06-26~~~,2,1,5,1
"My following comments are not really about the reliability or the quality of BT's products  but more so to do with what happens when something goes wrong  for example  when suddenly none of your phones work and your broadband works intermittently. The ""offshore"" service  on this occasion  were absolutely useless. The young lady  from somewhere in India  whilst irritatingly polite  (mentioning my surname a minimum of five times in one sentence)  never seemed to offer and straight answers to any of my questions and yet skilfully skirted around them  with well rehearsed ""scare tactics "" suggesting that I would be charged £120  should the engineer discover that it's not BT's fault. Never got any satisfaction after a full hour's frustration and aggravation. Eventually  having ""had enough "" I insisted on being put through to a UK based technical team who talked me through a few checks. Eventually I discovered and corrected  (by process of elimination and from my own skills set) the fault itself. It was a failed ADSL filter  which costed me £1.99 from the local ""sells everything"" shop. Come on BT  you gotta try harder. If you have to use offshore call centres  then  for goodness sakes  train them properly !~~~",Manchester~~~,2014-06-23~~~,1,2,4,4
When you compare notes  the BT con-artists use similar tricks; they blame: the socket  the ADSL filter  the telephone  your device  indeed everything possible to avoid fixing their own sub standard  poorly maintained equipment. 50 minutes yesterday spent convincing some Indian bloke that the line was faulty  and I would guess that his diagnostic tool could have indicated that within seconds. Download speed (!) of 0.13 mbps  when we expect to receive 6mbps  and are supposedly supplied with 12 mbps. Now the phone line is very crackly again  and the B T 0.5 wit attempts to persuade me that that my phone is to blame  and offers a new filter. I install a replacement filter; no improvement.  The phone line runs along an untrimmed hedge  and is about thirty years old. Two years ago they replaced a short length....~~~,Isle of Wight~~~,2014-06-17~~~,1,1,1,1
THE WORST CHOICE EVER. DON'T DO IT. You will spend more time on the phone to BT with their terrible customer service than anything else.  The customer service is so poor that they leave you on hold for 20-30 minutes and then put the phone down on you.  Quick to charge and late / never to deliver.  Purchased BT infinity yet only received BT Broadband with the slowest speed (takes min 5minutes to open a web page) if the rating had a negative option then BT would earn a negative in every aspect.~~~,Huntingdon~~~,2014-06-17~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
We've had telephone lines and broadband installed at work. BT are appalling to deal with. The first engineer  a gentleman with a Chinese appearance was very good  staying late into the evening to get lines connected but we needed another line installed into the building which he was not trained to do . Along comes another engineer who looked at what was needed  decided in 2 minutes he could not do it  walled off and told his boss he was unable to get access to our office suit-a complete lie  the next didn't even knock on the office door  he just said he could not get access. Then we were to have 3 lines going to one phone number but at present 1 line goes to that number so if we are on the phone no one can call us.  The salesman now doesn't answer emails or call.  So here we are 2 months on still without the correct work and without anyone having a care about it. Any suggestions on how we get BT to do the job they said they could so?~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2014-06-16~~~,1,1,3,2
What is wrong with BT Broadband Customer Care? More appropriately  BT Customer Care ought to be called the BT Customer Barrier. Its primary function is to defend BT from the problems its customers may be having and its fundamental ethos is that the customer is always wrong. They are the masters of the Dismissive Fob-Off. This is made abundantly clear at the point of initial contact  its internet pages  where the first thing to greet you is the statement that most faults occur within the customer’s own infrastructure. This bizarre assumption is carried right through the extensive faults procedure where each step is directed remorselessly toward persuading the customer to find and fix a fault that without further investigation is undoubtedly on their own premises and of their own making; BT does not admit that faults might occur outside of customer premises or make provision for those who are competent enough to have already carried out these basic checks and want to move on. Neither is there a clear onward step for BT to take ownership of a reported fault after the checking procedure has been completed – again there is an assumption that all faults are the responsibility of the customer. For a persistent customer it leaves the complaints procedure as the only option to progress. The complaints procedure is another mechanism dominated by the customer-is-always-wrong ethos. The first thing a customer service operator will do is to insist a customer go through the same step by step procedure covered by its internet pages  regardless of whether or not the customer has already done this. Presumably the operator is trained to believe that the customer is incompetent. There is a pre-scripted  condescending and belittling conversation that follows which often involves the customer service operator magically changing from a care representative into a sales representative  offering new packages and various pieces of equipment that he is almost sure will cure the fault. The last resort  if a customer manages to stand firm and turn down all these alluring offers  is for the operator to reassure the customer that everything will be all right if they just be patient and give it a couple of weeks. Then it’s goodbye. During the lifetime of a fault this procedure will repeat itself several times and each time the customer service operator will behave as if it were the first. BT appears to have no method of gathering useful retrievable information about a specific complaint or sharing it between operators. Eventually frustration and anger from a customer will lead to elevation where the customer is promised a call-back from a BT engineer. Call-backs from BT engineers are not lightly won.  If you are lucky to be promised a call-back you will be given a time slot and an automatic telephoned reminder first thing in the morning while you are still in bed. A pre-recorded voice message from a hugely condescending and suspiciously sceptic female will make sure you are awake and ready for your call  which may not be for several hours. If you are very lucky your call-back will be made  but often they are delayed or forgotten or have not been booked at all. And  of course  it will be your fault. I know all this because I have been through it on more than one occasion. My latest battering against the BT Customer Barrier began four or five weeks ago after I had meticulously carried out my own checks. For some months I had noticed that BT broadband was either dropping out completely or reducing strength to download speeds that were unusable  sometimes as low as 0.01mbps  but mostly between 1 and 2. This always seemed to coincide with peak times when my BT contract assured me my signal would not fall below 5 or 6. My own checks consisted first of looking closely at my wifi which at the time admittedly was quite weak. I installed a wifi repeater which boosted the signal but did not resolve the problem so I changed my phone filters but this did not resolve the problem either. I tested the line using quiet mode but there was no noise on the line  I changed my router  I repositioned my router  I changed to Ethernet and used only the BT service socket cutting out all intermediate infrastructure in my home  and I tried all of the above whilst turning on and off various devices I thought might affect my broadband signal. Nothing solved the problem. At this point I fully believed I had covered every possible self-check known to man  but BT felt differently and tried to make me go through them all again. BT then told me it was my router  which I knew it wasn’t  and that I would have to buy a new one  which I already had  so I declined; then they told me that most probably there was work going on in the area that I did not know about  but neither did the operator because when I asked him about it he admitted he did not know if there was work going on in the area or not. I actually admire him for making that bit up; it showed a spark of spirit. Eventually he told me everything would be all right if I was patient and to wait a couple of weeks  and then he said goodbye. Everything was not all right and after two more weeks  two more emails and two more conversations that had to begin from scratch because BT had forgotten everything I’d said previously  I eventually won my call-back from a BT engineer and an agreed time slot. Only it didn’t happen. I waited for the call but it never came. A call did come  nearly an hour after the allotted time slot  but I was not there having already given up waiting for it. And of course  that was my fault again. So  what is wrong with BT Customer Care? Well  just about everything to be honest. It is fundamentally flawed from top to bottom. It has a preconceived conviction that the customer is always wrong and does nothing to hide that conviction. From a customer perspective it is like trying to swim up a waterfall. They make you feel so small. BT Customer Care needs dismantling and rebuilding from scratch  it is an appalling  abhorrent and arrogant organisation that ought to be banned from having the name British in its title; I am pro-European and British  and I am ashamed that BT Customer Care can use the same designation  which is less confrontational than it sounds given that it is mostly located in India. It has become the benchmark by which all poor customer service in Britain is measured by  a level of incompetence to avoid. It’s no coincidence that other internet service providers make a major selling point of not having the same customer service setup as BT.Eventually my call-back came after weeks of trying and BT agreed to monitor my broadband speed to see themselves what was happening – an appropriate course of action I suggested at the outset. No apology because  naturally  I had been wrong to suggest it and it had only become the correct thing to do when they thought of it. They agreed to monitor my broadband speed and to call me back after three days. After only one day I received an email saying that I should monitor my own speed and send them the results. I pointed out that I had already done so  several weeks earlier. I sent them new results. In all the speed test results sent to BT a clear pattern of drop-out and poor signal strength at regular times during the day were obvious. BT then took to calling me back at times when they knew my signal would not be dropping and asking me to run a speed test  thereby proving I was wrong about having a fault on my line. Fault or no fault  BT Broadband remains unusable for around two hours per day. When this current contract ends I shall be looking for a new provider.~~~,Devon~~~,2014-06-13~~~,1,1,1,1
DO NOT USE THIS RUBBISH COMPANY! Internet speed in evening is so slow. Try to call them to sort it loads if times  always rude  always trying to pretend its due to the wireless connection. Their staff are basically blagging it. If it was wireless it would be all the time. It's clearly some form of throttling. Bottom line is they just say the speed is fine and are only willing to send an engineer out during the day when the problem isn't then.  They are basically getting £30 a month for nothing as I only really want the internet in the evening. Speeds are often 0.3mbs in evening. Avoid like the plague. I certainly will even be a customer of theirs again. As I wilL have to pay some hefty price to get out of them and get sky back in. As they have point blank refused to cancel the contract.~~~,Milton Keynes~~~,2014-06-12~~~,1,1,1,1
I must have been really lucky here  I have had FibreOp on Infinity 2 from BT for almost 18 months now  I had a shaky start getting the order right and getting the engineer here  and experienced a few router reboot in the beginning but once I realised I needed to get shot of the crappy HH3 they supplied and put a decent router on I've never looked back. Bandwidth has been consistently high  and I have between 4 and 15 devices connected at any one time  uptime is pretty good too  I think I've only been offline 2-3 times in that last 18 months and for 5 minutes at most. The reason for being offline and the only really annoying thing I have encountered with the connection is that I often work at night and the router reboot itself sometimes  after what looks like an attempted router update or some re-syncing going on. Other than this it has been good as gold and I have to say that around 8-9 of my friends and family are on it too and none of them have had any major problems to report. The one thing I have experienced however  is the shocking customer service  the fact that everything needs explaining in triplicate and that no-one seems to understand your point and that they are often keen to pass you over to the next person. I find this is the case with quite a few companies who farm out their telephone support though. Overall I am generally happy with the service and considering the number of folks experiencing troubles  I am feeling lucky that I have not had to spend too much time talking with India.~~~,E Sussex~~~,2014-06-11~~~,4,1,5,5
Our BT broadband experience has been terrible  we've a problem with parental controls meaning we can't even get facebook.

While the BTinfinity product is good  I've had terrible customer service issues during a house move. Broken promises  failed calls to arrange engineer visits and nearly 2 weeks without any service whatsoever. And then a wonderful bill comes through the door.

We've been with BT phone and broadband for two years.  Our package is 10GB broadband and anytime calls.  Most of the time  everything has worked fine.  Our contract  is soon due for renewal  so we've tried to haggle a new deal from BT.  We're currently paying £33 a month. They could offer nothing better  even though we quoted what other providers could offer.  Having read the dreadful reviews about other providers  we have no idea who to go with now.  So many folk seem to have problems.~~~,Southern England~~~,2014-06-03~~~,3,2,3,4

"I ordered BT Business Broadband in order to ensure a fast reliable serive and a fixed IP address on 21 May 2014. Emails and letters followed with all sorts of login names and passwords to confirm my order  and to tell me that I'll be connected by 29 May 2014  and that I'll get my router the day before. I therefore cancelled my Sky broadband  effictive end of May 2014. Today  on 30 May  I still had not received my promised router and broadband service. I called BT to find out that the Business broadband order line is only open Mon-Fri until 18:00! After several calls and being passed around someone eventually manages to tell me that my order ""has been cancelled"". They didn't know why  didn't know who had cancelled it  and didn't know why I hadn't been told. Therefore I will be left without a broadband or indeed internet service in about a day's time. No-one in BT has bothered to email me  call me  or send me a letter about this mysterious cancellation. Is this why they are ""Britain's favourite broadband""?! This is extremely poor and uncaring service from a company that does not care about its clients as individuals.~~~",London~~~,2014-05-31~~~,1,1,3,1
that guy who says 'bt offer no cooling off period'  yes you do  upon activation you can cancel. what company will let you have the service as a trial then cancel after...haha stupid and bt didnt explain full terms over the phone...grab a chair mate its like a book. they are advisers not story tellers.~~~,doncaster~~~,2014-05-26~~~,5,5,5,5
I really would not advise bt to anyone  the customer service is awful.

THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I installed a new line with Infinity Unlimited Weekend calls and calls abroad. It took them nearly 2 months to turn up and install my landline. They charged me nearly £200 in installation  activation fees and first month of rental and sent me a letter that my service is up and running. When I started calling abroad they sent me a bill for another £200 for international calls. I contacted them stating that it should be free of charge but they said that the service had not been activated and it takes up to 5 weeks to get it active  in the meantime I had to pay standard tariff. My brodband speed should have been close to 30Mb but it reached max of 0.9Mb. They blamed line filters  their  engineer came and replaced them charging me another £43.80. The speed remained the same  when I phoned them they told me that I probably have a virus (I have Mac) and tried me to sell antivirus for windows  also to install newest updates from Microsoft although it is Apple. At the end I just resigned being charged another £86 for eraly exiting fees and installed a new VirginMedia line. I WILL NEVER EVER GET ANYTHING FROM BT~~~,Seaham~~~,2014-05-16~~~,1,1,1,1
"BT's customer service via its overseas call centre is truly atrocious.They are completely lacking in empathy or understanding when there is a problem.That could be partially offset if they could do their job  but they can't diagnose - never mind solve issues.Worse still their complaint handling at the overseas call centre is laughable.Not only do they fail to phone back - on the day or time they themselves set - but when they do eventually contact you expect to be merely quoted unhelpful and generic drivel  along the lines of ""our BT standards say....""BT stance - via these call centres - even where there is clear evidence of financial loss due directly to their failures  is to weasel out of any responsibility.The new BT slogan should be ""BT broadband - with added choice"" ...you pay BT and when its service goes down you get to choose and pay for cellular broadband whilst BT try and sort out their own mess.~~~",Gloucestershire~~~,2014-05-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Living in a rural location means I can accept slow speed.  However  BT's customer service (from their non-UK) call centre - when something goes wrong - is atrocious.They are unable to diagnose  never mind resolve  issues.Furthermore  they don't phone back when they've arranged to and refuse to even consider compensation - even where there is documentary evidence of financial loss.  They're abusing historic goodwill and relying on customer apathy.~~~,Gloucestershire ~~~,2014-05-15~~~,2,1,1,2
The product is fine from BT no technical problems over the 12 months  however their sales team and customer service team communications and billing systems are the worst I have ever came across. I bought a bolton package when I signed up with BT that 12 months later they tried to re sell me the same one and advised I never had the package  there over complex time consuming billing system for BT phone calls and separate bills for Broadband is a joke  no simplicity the sales agents need to attain at least should be recruited with some listening skills  one costly problem led onto another  leave BT go with premier calls I halved my bills over night  BT are an expensive  overpriced~~~,Isle of Wight~~~,2014-05-15~~~,1,1,4,4
All I want is to receive a basic service and pay the correct amount each month. I have never had an issue with other companies  but BT can't seem to handle it without messing up. I have never  ever been billed correctly.  Getting any sort of assistance is near impossible. After spending half an hour navigating their menu systems and even longer being passed between various departments  you might be lucky to speak to somebody in the right team. Unfortunately  the staff in their call centres  whether based in the UK or overseas  are the rudest and most obnoxious people that you could ever experience. When an issue gets difficult to resolve  they simply hang up and pretend that the call dropped. Their complaints team aren't any better either. You are lucky if they offer a meaningless apology. They can't offer any recompense for the time  cost  inconvenience or vexation of having to spend hours and hours on the telephone resolving their mistake. They'll make promises and then retract them within a few hours. Several of the advisors in their Executive Level Complaints team feel that it's appropriate to scream and shout down the phone and then hang up. As they are such a large corporation  they seem to think they are above the law and don't have to abide with Ofcom's regulations. I have now referred two complaints to the Ombudsman  at BT's expense  and luckily I am in the process of moving suppliers. Gavin Patterson  you should hang your head in shame. Your company has fundamental issues and it seems to be getting worse. Never again.~~~,Flintshire~~~,2014-05-13~~~,1,1,2,1
BT service is the worst ever experiences in my life. They messed up the order twice i had to make several calls  and when you ask to talk with the managers the line drops... they took me money and they refund me back weeks later. They makes a lot of problems and mistakes and the foult is always of the customer. Broadband speed is not as expected and the service is always failing. I have to contact them at least twice a month to check. I will now move to sky they told me is much more reliable and customer service is able to manage queries.~~~,london~~~,2014-05-13~~~,1,1,2,2
I have always had my home internet services from BT and it's safe to say they have been unreliable at best.I have never had any issues with customer service but actual broadband speeds are absolutely atrocious. The highest speeds I have ever received are 3mb/s and that is on an extremely good day. Speeds are inconsistent and sluggish and something I have noticed happening regularly is the sudden dropout of all internet access at all times of day. If you're interested in gaming then this is definitely not for you. LAG is the only word to describe it. If you have access to BT Infinity then I'd maybe suggest going for that if you're still interested in choosing BT. But  if you live in the same area as me I would advise you avoid BT. A quick note on landline prices. BT phone bills that come quarterly and don't include unlimited calls can become extortionate. The amount's my mother has had to pay are absolutely ridiculous and I have finally changed our provider so hopefully things will vastly improve.~~~,Bath~~~,2014-05-12~~~,2,3,1,1

They lie  they put you off  they do not do what they say they will do  they charge you for a service that you do not get. Now in the realms of Taking BT for breach of contract. DO NOT USE THEM.

Total money grabbing con-artists. When you sign up  they tell you everything is great over the phone  but they do not make you aware that there is literally NO 'cooling off period' after receiving the full terms. This means that if you agree to the sparse terms they explain over the phone  hang up and then disagree with the full terms & conditions which you can only read once they email them to you  you're stuffed. They also do not make you aware that the cancellation fees constitute HALF the line rental which is over SIXTY POUNDS and you have no choice but to pay it because they've tied you into something you didn't know the full terms & conditions for. I will be avoiding them like they have rabies from now on and I suggest you do the same.~~~,London~~~,2014-05-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Since upgrading to Infinity with Hub 5  my consistent historic data usage has jumped from just under 10GB per month to over 20GB.  Have rung and complained so many times that their usage monitor (which my billing is based on) is inaccurate. Technical Department advised me to download thinkbroadband monitor to my desktop and guess what? It proves my usage is no where near what BT are stating! Now am locked in this on-going battle to be heard.  Their excuse is that my home hub is faulty and that the wireless can be picked up outside the home due to security issues? Checked all round my house - am on the WPA2 Personal and it is secure (with padlock symbol showing). Technical Department asked me to change wireless key - did this - usage still escalating? Technical Department sending a replacement hub? Not sure how that is going to affect the usage monitor which is clearly inaccurate. BT are thieves - they are stealing from me as in the 2 months since upgrading they have said I have gone over my 20GB allowance.  Strange as last month I was away for over 2 weeks and there was no usage whatsoever?! Now at the stage where I will have to write to OFCOM and considering going public with this. How can they get away with this?~~~,Hertfordshire~~~,2014-05-05~~~,1,1,3,3
BT call centre and support line in Bangalore is a joke  had to ring them to sort out a problem with my 90 year  old father's switch to BT mail.  They don't understand you and you can hardly understand them  my father would have had no chance!

I have had problems with going over my limit on broadband  which is confusing as i am on unlimited as by bill clearly states  i have spoken to many people at BT which is hard when you do not get a english speaking person and those who try to speak english are awful to deal with  i have never been able to view a bill online due to a cock up made by BT when setting up my account and also have had my direct debit payment changed without any notification or warning via post or email to let me the CUSTOMER know. My recent dealing with BT was to set up a new deal and should ony be paying £45 a month but the last 3 bills are £73  £83  £96 . I only use the web for emails and searching the net. BT cannot give anyone a breakdown on there broadband other than you have gone over  no dates or times or even what you have been doing e.g. downloading  streaming. BT are by far the worst company of all time and as soon as my contract is near the end i will be going elsewhere. I think this will end up like the PPI where people were being ripped of and someone will eventually blow the whistle on BT and there practices. I turned my pc of and broadband at the router and have not used it for 3 weeks and guess what i still went over my limit  this just proves they are lying thieving scum.~~~,west sussex~~~,2014-04-30~~~,~~~,~~~,3,3
