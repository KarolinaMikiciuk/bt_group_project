I ordered fibre plus 1st February 2021. I asked for a check to make sure all will be OK  that is a quick survey  and was told by text this will happen. Installation was due on the 19th March  I received emails and texts to tell me an engineer will attend between 8am and 1pm.The day before I called to make sure but was told there will be no need as cable does not need to be replaced. Then between 7am and 7:30 one guy was at my door from Kelly communications  he refused to install and left!BT then decided to place an order as if I did for ordinary fibre.Today 26th March it is very slow and carry on breaking!I am elderly so probably they think i do not need good and reliable broadband.Horrible company all about money  no sense of duty or morality.~~~,Chelmsford~~~,2021-03-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Finally leaving BT after over 30 years. I’ve stuck with them and rubbish Broadband  spending Thousands in the process  in the hope it will improve or Fibre would arrive. In the past 24 hours I’ve been cut off and not phoned back  lied to that I can’t raise a complaint unless I leave and kept on hold for up to 30 minutes. Going to 4G and giving up our landline. In my opinion they should no longer be allowed to operate~~~,Somerset ~~~,2021-03-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Hi BT team today I felt that I had to write a review on your wonderful BT team. I have been through to 3 departments today: BT TV accounts  BT Billing  BT TV reception & each person i spoke to was understanding  helpful & patient. Sunny in Doncaster a special thanks to him he is such a nice young man. He explained everything in full  not rushed & there was a favourable outcome. Outstanding customer service. Unfortunately I have forgotten the names of the 2 ladies who dealt with my next queries but they were equally the same.Many thanks from me a 75+ lady  keep up the good work .Irene Davies~~~,Stockport~~~,2021-03-25~~~,5,5,4,4
Absolutely shocking broadband! Useless for home workers. Avoid at all costs and choose any alternative provider!~~~,London NW9~~~,2021-03-22~~~,1,1,1,1
It took them 27 days to switch my adress  after they fail 3 times to do it.The internet is down every 10 minutes for couple of seconds. Impossible ti wotk from home. I wanted to cancel the contract  but they put me a tax of £268  because I don't want this poor service.~~~,Bournemouth~~~,2021-03-21~~~,1,2,3,1
Had issues from the start with BT. I was in a situation where I had to call to set up my account. They took down multiple details incorrectly. They informed me I would receive a welcome pack and over two weeks later I haven't received anything. I eventually had to call to get access to my online account with BT. This took over an hour due to multiple issues. For example  no one was able to provide my landline phone number (which I don't use or want)  the reason they said was for security purposes. I confirmed all my security questions and was still unable to get this detail until almost an hour into the call. I had to speak to 3 different people altogether and 2 were very rude while the first person I spoke to was polite. So hit and miss on the customer service. Next comes the broadband speed check. I have had broadband for just over 2 weeks. I pay for 74MB/s fibre. Every test I did came in between 20MB/s and 52MB/s download speed. I reset my router and tried again multiple times. I then  after getting access to my account online ran a BT speed test (a few of them)  it always came in at 74MB/s. So what I have now come to the conclusion is a fake test as even a wired connection to the router never got above 52MB/s. The biggest joke is the actual broadband products they provide. They only guarantee a speed at less than half of what you pay for. In my opinion  this 74MB/s package should therefore be advertised as a 34MB/s package. With fibre  you would expect a consistent faster speed than a standard package. Unfortunately  I am stuck with BT for now  previously I was with Virgin at 100MB/s with no real issues for over 8 years (speed tests were much more consistent  sometimes exceeding what I was paying for). As soon as Virgin becomes available in my area I will be changing suppliers back to Virgin. Overall  bad router  bad broadband package  wrong advertising on their products  hit and miss with customer service  bad website  fake BT speed test. Broadband hasn't cut out hence the 2 stars on reliablity but it is slowly getting worse before having to reset the router each time.~~~,Preston~~~,2021-03-19~~~,1,2,1,2
BT have consistently failed to deliver acceptable standards of customer service. 1. Competitive contract prices. Had to negotiate new contract prices down to new customer levels over the course of 1 hour. They then included at their own decision anti-virus software at the cost of £8 per month. This had to be removed at my request. It was not mentioned that it was included as an add on. A complaint was raised.2. Cancelled my contract on the incorrect date. When moving home I informed BT I was leaving my current property and when the contract should end. They cancelled it on an incorrect date leaving me without home broadband for 2.5 weeks. Offering a 4g mini hub as an apology which has been poor. Several complaints were raised.3. Attempting to charge for a homehub. When leaving BT  BT will provide a package so that you can return the homehub to them or face a fee of £43. This was not received before the move and BT have attempted to charge for this. A complaint was raised. I would never use BT again. I would never recommend BT to friends or family and would in fact actively discourage people from using their services.~~~,London~~~,2021-03-10~~~,1,1,2,1
I've been with BT for over 5 years now  and to be honest  I've had absolutely no issues at all. I'm in a new build property  so that probably helps - all the phone line plumbing etc is new. So I can't really comment on customer service as I've had zero reason to get in touch with them  other than to upgrade from standard ADSL to Infinity 2 a few years ago. The standard BT hubs are not  in my opinion  particularly great  so I ditched mine ages ago and use a good quality unit purchased separately. I have found speed to be consistently good - better than advertised. The only issue is price - it has crept up somewhat during my contract  so I've knocked customer service down to 4 stars as I don't like the practice of hiking prices for existing customers  although BT aren't the only offenders here. Overall  good reliable service but not especially competitive on price  so I'm looking around for alternatives now..~~~,Cheshire~~~,2021-03-07~~~,3,4,5,5
Doesn’t even deserve one star!!! Doesn’t even deserve one star! So I signed up for BT on the 6th of January didn’t hear anything from Bt after so I had to get back in touch and order again on the 25th of January. My hub arrived pretty quickly to be fair but this was literally the only quick and efficient part. Opened the box and half of the connections were missing  there was no adsl filter or grey connection cable. So I waited for a couple of days and still herd nothing from BT so I made a call to find out when I would be connected. They told me I would go live on the 5th of February  this date came and went so I had to contact BT again  they then said I would be live on the 12th of feb  which was fine. The 12th came and still no connection  so of course I called BT again  they told me they needed to get an engineer out and that one would come on the 15th  yes you know what’s coming next  still no broadband or engineer. I had to make yet another call to Bt to then be told that an engineer would be out to get the connection up and running etc on the 4th of March and I would be live between the 4th-6th  yet again still no connection so I had to make another phone call yet again today! To my frustration I was told the same bull and that they would speak to the connections team so I was told she would one be a few short moments.....55mins I was on hold for to then be cut off. So yes at this point I’m done  someone was good enough to call me back and apologise for the loss of connection and said they just needed to go through some security questions with me before he could look into it  I stopped him at this point and told him to cancel my order  he said again he was sorry on behalf of Bt and will get this sorted rite away  I said cancel my order and have gone with a different provider now  sky promise I will be live on the 16th of March. Music to my ears  my children mite finally be able to connect to the internet and do their schoolwork log onto google classroom and try and somewhat catch up with the work they have not been able to do thanks to BT.  I know I have gone on a little but I am so frustrated and angry with the customer service and the whole service of Bt infact  to keep getting told and promised that we would be connected after two months is a bloody joke  and yes I know circumstances are difficult for us all at the moment because of Covid so why keep moving the goalpost and postponing connection for me and lie everytime I called. Appalling!  I will never ever go with Bt again after this experience  I will avoid at ALL costs  certainly will not be recommending BT to anyone ever.  Also when you call customer services expect to be on the phone for atleast two hours  you will spend around 110mins listening to music on hold while they go and make a cup of tea and eat cake  to pop on the phone for about a min to tell you it will be connected at such and such a date then hang up  and guess what......you don’t get connected.  Very unhappy customer and angry~~~,Wales~~~,2021-03-07~~~,1,1,1,1
"DO NOT GO WITH BTFASTER MEANS NOTHING IF IT NEVER WORKS. 16 months ago i made the mistake of paying a premium for BT direct to premises fibre.After disconnecting my previous provider  i was then told by the engineer that they could then not connect me to the BT fibre as there wasn't any on my street  despite being sold that package. I was finally connected six weeks later  during which time i had no internet. Since then  my fibre has been cut  literally  four times by Openreach engineers each time they connect another house on my street. Apparently  my fibre is at the top of the box and every time somebody new on the street gets fibre  mine gets broken when they open the box. Why this is the case is beyond me or any of the engineers who have been out to ""fix"" it. The problem is still occurring. My fibre went out yet again yesterday  (for the third time during lock down  whilst I'm trying to home school three kids and work from home) so i went down to the exchange where i knew i would find an engineer  who told me that through he'd broken it  he couldn't fix it. So far  both the engineer that broke it and the one that came out to fix it  have failed to fix it. The dongle that i have previously been sent does not work in my house as i get no signal. Having spent three hours on the phone to 12 different people at BT over the last two days  i have been told that they won't activate my copper line temporarily whilst they fix the fibre (usually takes at least two weeks). I just have to do without internet whilst working from home and home schooling. I pay over £50 a month for this privilege. I genuinely wish i'd just stayed on regular broadband. I'm not going to call again. I give up. You win.~~~",Forest Hill~~~,2021-02-26~~~,1,1,2,1
We had a really bad experience.  We swapped to BT as our previous provider was slow and erratic.  Imagine our surprise when we found that BT was the same. Worse still  we had asked to keep our phone number and had been promised that this would be done.  On the day our broadband was switched BT disconnected our phone line as “we had not requested one”.   Who  in this day and age  lives without a main home phone.  Not only that but we have lost the phone number we have held for over 35 years.  No one wants to help us get it back. So angry!~~~,London~~~,2021-02-23~~~,2,2,3,3
No grounds for complaint at all. Fibre speeds  are good (and consistent)  reliability is excellent  and the BT Smart Hub is great.. Providing that you negotiate seriously at renewal time  the price stays competitive and removes any need to switch.~~~,Hambleton ~~~,2021-02-22~~~,4,4,4,5

Incredibly angry about BT's service.  Switched from Sky because of promise of fire optic which after 2 weeks was told wasn't available.  Then a long string of problems.  No managers ringing back when promised.  Then even the standard copper broadband order didn't go through because of a problem.  Endless problems and terrible customer service. Don't waste your time with BT  go to sky or whoever else.~~~,Cirencester~~~,2021-02-12~~~,1,1,1,1

When I signed my BT landline plus broadband contract  I was informed it is going to be a 12-month contract. One month before the contract ends  I phoned customer service to give the 30 days notice. I was told that my contract has magically extended. I have to pay £140++ worth of cancellation fee. This is all be cause BT sneakily advertised the landline service to be mis-matched with the broadband  so that we customers will be tricked to pay for the broadband for 18 months. I am a student who are financially affected by the pandemics. I demand my service to be cancelled free of charge.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2021-02-08~~~,1,2,2,2

Moving over from Sky fibre broadband to BT FULL FIBRE BROADBAND would be easy I thought  as I was promised minimal disruption.  Instead  BT have left me with no internet connection and no phone line for almost a week (and still counting). My wife and I can’t work from home (I am vulnerable)  kids can’t be homeschooled  parents can’t call us. Add to that we can’t access our Netflix or Amazon accounts. This is most likely the WORST CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE of my life. I have had to buy a mobile Wi-fi dongle and data card at nearly £100 to give me something in the interim. Gave one stars only because the system didn’t allow me to leave zero. Can I go back to Sky...?~~~,Leeds~~~,2021-02-06~~~,1,2,1,1

Awful customer service  lie after lie to get me off the phone and no clarification on when we'll be connected. Decided to look elsewhere and cancel our subscription immediately~~~,Cheshire~~~,2021-02-05~~~,1,1,1,1
I've been a BT customer since I moved from Sky 8 years ago. Moved the service to the new house 2.5 years ago with some problems with the new set up. Since then I have 74mb up and 18 ddown 24 hurs a day EVERY day. I am now moving to the FTTP 300 mb option and have had the xternal work done (cable from the cabinet 30 yards away) and I'm now waiting for the internal connection  delayed due to the epidemic. I have always found the broadband rock steady and at the speed advertised. I do not use the BT router/wireless hardware as it is far too restricting in how you can set it up (30 years in the IT) industry. No company is perfect but I am a happy bunny with them and would not change suppliers.~~~,Torquay~~~,2021-02-02~~~,5,4,5,5
business broadband is absolute crap. There has been no full week of optimal performance  either constant dropped connections or just download speed below an acceptable level.BT is absolute crap for the level of national infrastructure they have unfettered access to. I will not recommend the business plan to anyone nor the regular plan as I've used both. Customer service is good as there the poor guys always try to help but from a LEAN perspective  organizations that invest so much in customer service to deal with errors have done a very bad job in giving a good service.~~~,London SW9~~~,2021-01-23~~~,1,5,1,1
BT is the worst provider i have been with. Sky was more reliable and they use they BT line.... go figure??!!. Customer service is the only positive they have in my thoughts. As soon as virgin media is in the street I will be changing provider. I would not recommend BT services.~~~,Brownhills~~~,2021-01-22~~~,1,5,1,1
I despair at BT nowadays. For the past 2 months  over 20 phone calls to them and several hours on the phone I still have 2 landlines. Is it too much to ask just to transfer the broadband to the other line and then close the first line? Every BT advisor has a different opinion of how to do this. Their complaints procedure is not fit for purpose and they never call me back. Usually half an hour wait to talk to them then constantly transferred. Its time the Government looked at their infrastructure monopoly in the countryside.~~~,East Yorkshire~~~,2021-01-22~~~,1,1,2,2

The service to get connected with BT broadband is worse than in a third world country. I have spent a total of over 7 hours waiting  being cut off   passed round different departments repeating the same name and address details to different people coming on the phone and talking gobbledegook.

After recently joining BT I was not best pleased with some of the service we got and nothing was getting actioned. However I luckily got a lovely lady called Jinder Kaur from the Leicester office (I think) who promptly resolved the issue and promised to call back which she did and also followed up after Christmas to make sure I received my connectors and got the engineer booked in. If only all customer service stay was like her in every company!! These 5 stars go directly to her and I really hope this review will be passed on to her. Thank you Jinder!!

One of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. Been a customer for years and always had pretty terrible broadband below speeds of 1mbps  and crackling telephone line.Customer service is awful and they will use a variety of tactics to prevent you from leaving them  including just charging you after you phoned about 8 times to cancel. Waste of money  bad service  bad customer service  would not recommend.~~~,Lankfer~~~,2020-12-27~~~,1,1,1,1

Broadband ordered at EE/BT shop; EE agent signing me up to BT contract ordered wrong installation. He also got my email address wrong and failed to correct it when I pointed this out. After much to-ing & fro-ing  the wrong installation was corrected but BT classed that as a new contract (not a correction)and charged me a higher price ! BT refunded the difference only after high level complaint  but refused to correct the erroneous contract price. After 3 unscheduled calls to me when I was out  BT's CEO staff's first reply to my complaint was an email saying they'd closed my complaint  with no explanation. I had to arrange a scheduled call to find out what action had been taken. They said the 'closed complaint' unexplanatory email was standard policy  and they (CEO staff !) had no power to change it  nor could say who set up that policy. Also said they were the highest complaint level  the CEO & senior staff were above my reach (how convenient for them !)~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2020-12-15~~~,2,1,~~~,~~~

"""Sorry  nothing we can do"" should be BT's mottoThe worse experience with anything ever. It started at the end of September when I placed an order for their full fiber 100 and TV package. It was more expensive than the competition but because it was a line take over they told me it should take only 20 days to get it set up as opposed to other companies that told me it would take a month or more. 20th of October was the initial activation date and the only thing that goes live is the landline (super useful in 2020) and nothing else. Apparently there was a need for additional work before they could get the broadband installed so I was pushed back to the 29th. On the 29th an engineer came and told me he could not install the fiber broadband because there is no fiber run to this building. Apparently Open Reach has also messed up their site and had the wrong details about what kind of broadband can be installed at my address. This is the beginning of the downward spiral. After that BT doesn't know how to deal with the problem. They put me on a temporary copper connection straight out of 1995 with less than 1Mbps speed on average and tell me it might take up to 26 weeks to fix the problem. At least the TV line was activated so good job there I guess. Luckily  it only take a couple of weeks for Open Reach to fix their mess but when I thought it was finally over it turns out that the original fiber broadband I have order is no longer available  in fact there is no more FTTP plan available  only FTTC. As confused as I was I said ""fine get me that one and let's be done with this"". Another small problem  because the initial order has gone through it has glitched the system and no one can cancel the order now in order to place a new one. Now this is the peak of autism for BT. When I call to ask for a solution someone tells me that it might be faster to make a new account in my name (the original was in my father's name) and take over the line. What he failed to mention is the penalties that will be incurred for doing so. I call them and ask them about that and they told me ""it's all very unfortunate and we are very sorry but there is nothing that we can do"". I was directed to the billing department to dispute it and will update this review with the results. So  after all that  more that 2 month of delay you would think that I finally got my services activated. Wrong! 9th of December was the new activation date and that day comes and again nothing. I called today (10th of December) and they told that they will get back to me  Almost every time they told me that nothing happened and I had to call them back. At his point I don't know what to say anymore. I have been treated like a door mat for BT to wipe their feet on and then I was asked to pay for that privilege. To be fair  their customer services was friendly but next to useless so what's the point? 0/10 would absolutely not recommend  even urge you to steer clear if at all possibl~~~",Epsom~~~,2020-12-10~~~,1,2,1,1
