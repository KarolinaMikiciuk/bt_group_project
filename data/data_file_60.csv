I had an issue with BT several years ago where they tried to charge me £180 for ending my contract early. I eventually proved them wrong and had the charge overturned. After this episode I decided I would never return to BT. However  given the offers for new members that were available last year I decided to give them another go. After experiecing very poor broadband speeds I have started to shop around for new fibre optic offers as my contract is due to end in a months time. BT are the most expensive provider out there! The most difficult part is trying to cancel your contract. I have called several times recently to discuss the cancellation and not until the third call did someone advise me that if I left before the contract end date I would be liable to pay them over £88 for cancellation fees. I have called today to give them my 30 day notice (as requested to do so) but was told not to and just arrange the switch over with another provider. Avoid if you can  really not worth the hassle when you come to renew contracts and there is far better price plans out there.~~~,West Yorkshire~~~,2015-10-02~~~,1,1,1,1
On the technical side  the broadband is very variable.  Sometimes it is ok  and others so slow to be of no use.  Worse  is their policy of charging as much as they can get away with  and trying to hide charges in over complicated bills.  Plus really really bad customer care.~~~,North Somerset~~~,2015-10-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Well my experience with BT has been very poor. I've currently had a fault on my fibre line for 3 months and after dealing with quite frankly appalling customer services for approximately 2 months I have recently been dealing with a digital care case manager whose latest reply to me told me that they do not compensate  so effectively I've been locked into a contract paying each month for a substandard service. They've now been reported to ofcom who are now investigating my complaints. I would and will now be advising everyone I speak to that the should avoid BT.~~~,Kent~~~,2015-10-01~~~,1,1,3,1

We decided to put all our eggs in on basket  landline  broadband  & mobile. We've had five weeks of absolute hell. We've had 17 e-mails  5 order streams  the same number issued on both mobiles  8 changes of dates (inc dates made without consulting us)  staff lying to us about calling  being transferred 7 times on one call  and countless other incompetances.They can't update orders until each service is completed.BEWARE on BT Mobile: BT does NOT offer a Personal Hotspot/tethering services  and won't tell you unless you ask the right question.~~~,BN435SA~~~,2015-09-29~~~,1,1,4,3

"Not only do you get half or less of what you are promised  you also get disconnected all the time. When you bring that up at customer service  they basically tell you ""well  too bad for you but you agreed to a contract"". Why am I the only one who has to respect the contract? If I am not getting what I am paying for  I should be able to get out. Greedy company with a horrible service (and customer service is very bad).

What a disorganised  disfunctional and arrogant organisation. Signed up with bt for tel line  infinity broadband and bt tv on the 24th august for new property we wre moving into on 18th sept Promised a vist on 14th& 21st sept to have all installed  noticed on tracking my order on the 18th to see that 21st visit had been cancelled without any notification from them. told unable to do outside work rebooked for 30th sept and 6th oct. Low and behold next day an engineer was outside doing the work. Looked at my order tracking and 21st visit was reinstated. But on the 20th day after the first visit an engineer knocked and said he was there for outside work! explained it was all done but needed the inside work done. He could not do that and left. took a day off work to there on 21st and guess what no engineer turnerd up. Rang customer service and told work wont be done now to 9th october. What a waste of time and effort. They never contact you give a load of spiel. and no help what soever. sent an email of complaint but never got a reply. Wished we stayed with sky. and i thought they had bad customer service.BT STOP SPENDING VAST AMOUNTS ON FOOTBALL AND ADVERISING AND GET YOUR HOUSE IN ORDER AND WORK  TO KEEP CUSTOMERS~~~,Bodmin cornwall~~~,2015-09-28~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
NEVER AGAIN BT !!I had no problem for 2.5 years with TalkTalk and then Plusnet broadband. But after less than a month with BT broadband  our service went down for almost 3 weeks.Needless to say this was a big inconvenience and also meant we could not watch the BT Sport channels we had subscribed to. To make matters worse we were told we would receive a refund for the period we had no service  but once it was fixed BT said we would actually receive no refund at all!~~~,Greenwich~~~,2015-09-26~~~,1,1,3,1

Overall experience horrible  wouldn't recommended b.t to any one customer service is non existent just a nasty horrible company that  likes taking money from sick individuals that already are suffering from life threatening disease and b.t just makes it worse by taking money from them that their don't have also their have un professional people that have no training or skills working for them who don't know how to talk to customers treat you like your nothing so rude apparently their don't have management working on weekends and if you do wish to complain you'll be waiting hours and hours disgusting that's all I can say don't join b.t you'll regret just like I do.~~~,Bedfordshire~~~,2015-09-25~~~,1,2,1,1
I will be trying to give a 0 star but I suspect a 1 star will be forced.  I've had two appointments for an engineer to install and connect a line. Both times they have failed to turn up. Both times they have failed to contact me to even mention this. Both times I have been told by BT staff that the appointment was definitely going ahead. Both times the information was wrong.  I have cancelled the order and will not use BT.  I would advise anyone not to touch them  they seem very understanding of the absolute slackness of their engineer suppliers.  letting them get away with whatever they like  but their service to paying customers is non-existent.  I wish I knew who BT use as engineers in my area so I could review them too.~~~,Merseyside~~~,2015-09-25~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
"Worst customer service I have EVER came across I moved house 8 days ago. Changed my details online 8 days ago. Called then 7 days ago to query why my broadband wasn't working. The details werent changed on their computer. I changed them over the phone. It still didn't work. I called the next day. Details STILL weren't changed. I changed them AGAIN over the phone. Still not working. The following day I was assured repeatedly that my details had been changed and that my broadband would be working by midnight. Shock horror the following morning it still wasn't working. I called back  was told there was nothing wrong their end. That I had to call back when I was at home and someone from the technical dept would assist me. I called back yesterday. Apparently it WAS their problem....that they were having ""technical issues"". But I was assured my broadband d would be up and running by midnight. Would you believe...I woke this morning and it's STILL not working. I called AGAIN at 8am today  to be told my details hadn't been changed! After an hour on the phone  being passed from advisor to advisor  (most of which couldn't understand a word I was saying!)  I was assured yet again that my broadband would be working by midnight  she even had to the cheek to say ""you can trust me"". Pfft. It's now half past midnight and surprise surprise it's STILL NOT WORKING!! After countless amounts of phone calls....each time speaking to at least 4 diff advisors. I can safely say I am sick to the back teeth with bt. They are the worst customer advisors I have EVER had to deal with~~~",Aberdeen~~~,2015-09-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely appalling speed and intermittent wifi connection. Customer service after numerous calls of resetting etc still couldn't do help and told me my infinity contact which hI pay top whack for does not guarantee a wifi service  only high speed for ethernet connection. So pointless buying modern technology like ipads!!! They say there is nothing I can do as I'm stuck in a contract and apparently it's in the small print!!!  I asked to speak to a supervisior but surprise surprise not one available on his shift. Steer clear people!!!!!~~~,Worthing ~~~,2015-09-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute crap  have to reset my hub minimum 3 times a week. I have the so called fastest infinity  takes an infinity more like to get going and onto websites. Costs too much for such a under mediocre speed and service. internet loses connection at important times frequently  can never even write and email without having to draft it during writing as internet will cut out again. BT  spend money on improving the service for your existing customers  don't just concentrate on signing new ones up. Once signed up  when we realise what a terrible service you give us  we can complain  don't you realise this when trying to sign up new customers. I am glad that now after complaining to you I can soon dump you for a more reliable provider. What a sigh of relief when this came in  no more having to honour long drawn out contracts and bad service. As for your customer service...you only get to speak to British when you complain and threaten to leave....pathetic! The only time you care is when you will lose money. Seriously  for anybody looking for a reliable broadband provider  that gives value for money and genuinely cares for it's existing customers...look elsewhere  BT think they can live on past reputations when they was just about the only provider dealing in telecommunications...times change  just like my broadband provider soon will be!~~~,Essex~~~,2015-09-24~~~,1,2,1,1
Got Fibre Optic a year ago. worked straight off at 80mbps+Now slowed right down to 45mbpscontacted BT and after several checks identified my line has been turned down to 45mbpsWhen I asked why I was told it was due to my previous issues (I'd had none) and that an engineer would go to  my local exchange and tuned it back up  they haven't (no surprise)Now I know 45mbps isn't really slow  but I checked with BT before buying that I would get 80+ and did for a year.They still say 80+ is available and my neighbour get it  so I'm left paying for something I'm not getting. Out of interest if you go to http://speedtest.btwholesale.com then run a speed test you will see the speed your getting. Once you've done that select further diagnostics enter your broadband related phone number and run diagnostics test The result will display the speed available on your connection. Its less than when you first had the service then its a BT issue. Don't be fobbed off by BT telling you its not down to them. It may be that they've turned it down for existing customers because the exchange is struggling  thats simply not your issue and you should get what you signed up for and are paying for.~~~,Northants~~~,2015-09-23~~~,2,3,2,3
I'm incredibly disappointed. Especially that I feel I have no other way but to find every review site to express this. We have had a home hub 5  which they have advised was faulty so sent us a new one. In which we installed this evening and guess what not working. So at 7pm we called BT with the hope they could resolve it. So the current time is now 10.02pm. Still no resolution. They tried to advise us that there was a problem with our devises and not with BT. In which as you can imagine didn't not go down well. The next thing was we can offer you a chargeable service. Why would we pay extra when you can't get something correct for what we do pay for now! We have now been left for another day so in total no internet for 5 days. So work is now on the back burner due to poor BT service. I do hope they sort it out as we have adviser we will allow them the 24 hours they have requested. Please re-think if you think BT is the way forward.~~~,~~~,2015-09-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely disgusting service  ordered BT services & infinity broadband full package & we have been waiting 4 weeks for installation & activation...we've been passed from pillar to post every time we ring up & all in all lied to every time. Engineer came on Saturday & even he himself said how bad it was...still waiting for broadband activation which should have been up and running a week ago  they have now informed me that it will be another 2 weeks before that happens!!! This is falsely advertised & marketed & BT as a company are nothing but scammers in my opinion. Customer service operatives have hung the phone up on 3 occasions.... Surely they should be answerable to trading standards.....~~~,lancashire~~~,2015-09-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Have been with bt for over 25 years but now find their customer care is very poor from there call centres to there automatic phone service which can take ages to connect you to another automatic menu in the last few weeks I have spent over 7 hours in total regarding an over high bill to the extent I have cancelled my contract with . The even have the cheek to charge a disconnection charge even after the 21 days notice wouldn't recommend there service in future~~~,glasgow~~~,2015-09-21~~~,2,1,3,2
I'd have given no stars if possible.  For six months I have had little or no internet service. I have spent hours on the 'phone to them  gone through all the tests they asked me to do at home and still no broadband.  They sent me new ADSL filters. They had no effect.  BT told me that if they sent an engineer and it was some fault in the house I'd be charged for the engineer's visit.  I wouldn't know.  Most days I only have internet for an hour in the morning or late at night.  After being with BT since they started I finally had to admit defeat and defect to Virgin.  I have just received an email from them telling me that as I'm leaving them they're going to charge me for discontinuing my broadband connection!!!  It's been mostly discontinued for six months.  As I have no computer broadband connection I've maxed out my mobile internet allowance - result I have absolutely NO broadband connection while paying for both computer AND mobile.  To say I'm hacked off would be an understatement.~~~,S.W. London~~~,2015-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
I had been with plusnet for a year and had No issues at all. Probably only really needed to restart my router about 3 times in a year. With BT now for a month  as I wanted to get bt sport.the internet is terrible. I used tobe able to get a potential speed of 16ms/s and now I am downloading a file which is 424mb and it says it will take 6 hours! I restated my router and still the same. Very poor~~~,Cheltenham~~~,2015-09-18~~~,3,4,2,1
I foolishly turned down a great deal with Virgin to pay a little less for BT infinity and BT sport. Wow  how stupid of me. Should I really have expected a decent service? After all  this lot pay Michael Owen money to actually talk about football  a perfect reflection of how much they know about technical details and customer service. In fact am more annoyed with myself  believing this BS sorry I mean BT. You get what you pay for. My advice  go Virgin and reluctantly pay extra for Michael Owen and BT to ruin the beautiful game further. Oh and don't believe when they say  your complaint has been lodged  they'll call you on a certain date. There's more likely hood in Michael and Co blurting out something insightful. Sky and Virgin may be over priced  but at least they bring some level of British class  whether that be programming or quality in service. BT  you're like Nokia. By the time you realised how far you got left behind by competitors. You'll always be two steps behind and hated by those who give you a second chance. Time to remove the 'B' from BT. They have nothing that makes us feel proud. Sir Richard  forgive me. I'll be back asap.~~~,Brixton London~~~,2015-09-18~~~,1,1,1,1
As typical of other reviewers  BT customer services is very poor indeed.  Multiple calls  failure to listen  failure to update notes  failure to take action  failure to respond to complaints. Shame  because my experience of the broadband service itself was fine.  Pity for BT they are now losing me as a customer simply because of their customer service operation~~~,London~~~,2015-09-17~~~,1,1,3,4
We went with BT because it was advertised so well  however they sent us the wrong cable to connect our internet with  then they charged us £130 to rectify the mistake that they made in the first place! We are absolutely appalled with the service and will do our best to tell anyone who will listen never to go to BT again~~~,Leeds~~~,2015-09-16~~~,1,1,1,1
I have had this so called Internet Phone and TV Package for one month of constant hassle unreliable poor quality TV Phone service which sometimes take up to nine attempts to get through. You dial the number and the line goes dead  and occasionally you do get through on the first attempt  this is when the phone is connected directly to the BT test socket. The phone line has been checked over six times and according to BT its working perfect. The Broadband speed is between 74 and 79 Meg but this is not all that important when its continually dropping connection as I discovered when I examined the Home Hub 5 Logs. This is probably the reason for slow scrolling of web pages and the appalling TV service on my You view box + when watching internet streaming channels. The You view + box isn't much better on  free view either even though all the TV's in my house work without a problem. The main TV is fed from the aerial output of the You view box and work perfectly. BT Residential are a backstreet technically incompetent bunch on con merchants who tell lies and they will never provide the service they promised  you.You are paying for just an unworkable system. Do Not expect to cancel your contract early because it is not possible  even though the service does not work. I was asked to pay over £500 to terminate my contract. WISH I HAD STAYED WITH VIRGIN MEDIA  the maybe not as cheap but the system you pay for does work 100% reliable for me for the last 12 years. I am being connected to Virgin on Wednesday just so I can have a reliable Broadband Service. I will just cancel BT at the end of my contract and switch the rest of my services back to VIRGIN MEDIA.WARNING TO ALL POTENTIAL BT CUSTOMERS  DONOT BE FOOLED STAY AWAY. ONE VERY UNHAPPY BT CUSTOMER~~~,Middleton~~~,2015-09-15~~~,1,1,1,1

The worst customer care ever!~~~,Hitchin~~~,2015-09-14~~~,1,1,2,1
I've been a bt customer for over 3 years. I pay my bill online ever month with no issue. However due to the fact I don't pay by direct  debit they decided to cut me off in July 2015. So I phoned the bt number and got put through to an  automated service line that kept telling me that ( your service has been restricted because you have not payed your bill) every time I selected discuss my bill it just reported (  your service has a restricted because you have not paid your bill ) aaarrrrr in the end I had to say the customer had died to be able to speak to some one about my bill. ( disgrace )Finally I spoke to a guy from cts and he was so rude and wouldn't let me talk. He constantly spoke over me. I said to him that I've been a  customer for over 3 years and I've always payed my bill every month. He didn't even care. So I asked to cancel my phone line immediately  he said that's no problem I can do that but you will receive a £30 cut off bill and a £42 30 day notice period plus a £10 late payment fee and the month that you in arrears and also the next months bill also.£48 bt monthly bt bill x2£30 cut off fee£30 30 day notice fee£10 pound late charge fee Total £166.00Then he asked how would I like to make payment. I just laughed at him. I started  to question if I was actually calling  The right number for bt. I just can't believe what had just happend. I did say that I'm not in a contact and he said it doesn't matter. I asked to speak to a manager and he  replied  the manager will only say the same thing. I just put the phone down. I'm so upset that I've been treated like this. I just want others to realise what these dirty cheats are like. I can't stop any one from going to bt but please make sure you're happy with the service you got. On the plus side  I have my own company and I have to pay a lot of money for my  Business line. £xxxx. It  renews at the end of October this year. Can't wait to cancel this and see what service they try to offer me then. Thanks Bt for you customer service.~~~,Farnborough~~~,2015-09-14~~~,1,1,1,1
"Just moved into a brand new house and unfortunately have BT ""Fibre to the Home"" installed. This means I can only go with BTBT is a much higher cost than their competitors but also not geared up to support ""Fibre to the home"". When you have a query you get passed from one person to the next with the ""Fibre to the home is not my job  try someone else"".Speed is extremely poor ... I get less than 10mb speed which is worse than the landline-based broadband at my old houseCost is high and the cheapest option limits you to 20gb upload/download per month (no carry forward of unused broadband) ... however the monitoring by BT is extremely inaccurate and you can use 1gb simply accessing bbc.co.uk/newsOverall it makes for an unusable & expensive service.Somehow I need to find a way to switch to a more ethical broadband supplier~~~",Lancaster~~~,2015-09-14~~~,1,1,1,1

Been with BT since 96 am now looking for a new provider after 2 weeks of arguing.If you have slow broadband and they want you to put your computer in safe mode DONT It gives a false  high speed and then they have satisfied the legislation they sighed up for and all your rights have gone.They caught me with thisTwo of their engineers computers gave readings of 0.5 meg my two computers gave about the same took the sky box off and the tablet turned off the phones and put it in safe mode as I was told to by  bt reading shot up to 3.1 for one test.Thats it you dont't get any more help.Have opened a Ofcom dispute.~~~,Northampton~~~,2015-09-13~~~,1,1,1,1

TERRIBLE. The worst wifi  the worst service  and the most frustrating thing. I can sit approximately 5 cm away from my 3rd router sent to 'fix the problem' and I can't load a web page. Constant drop outs  no interest in helping  spoke to a UK manager after hours of being on the phone to India multiple times and she was probably the most rude and unhelpful person on the planet. I feel sorry for anyone tied into a contract and have had the displeasure of dealing with BT  they won't help  they will just charge you over £200 to leave the contract and then continue to mis-sell you products at an extortionate price after a few months.

"Quite literally the worst customer service I have ever received. We started receiving huge bills (£150).  Tried to cancel. Confusion over previous account holders  who is liable  charged obscene amounts until we cancelled the direct debit as they wouldn't let us cancel or vary the contract as we weren't the account holders  although we had been paying the bills for 2 years (although it had been changed but they claimed only to an ""online account"" holder not the account holder which even they got confused over on the calls) spent countless of hours on the phone  emailing  all for them to say they had done nothing wrong and to cut us off without any notice. This took 3.5 months.Poor communication  conflicting advice. Literally morons who dared to be condescending towards us when we pointed out the endless string of flaws and logical inconsistencies with their argument( like writing a letter to the ""account holder' at an address they had not lived at for 2 years years telling them they were going to cancel).They told us from the outset that they could not vary the account holder's name  yet somehow have magically 3.5 months later transferred it in to my partner's  name without her permission?!So what we wanted at day 1 to resolve the issue took 3.5 months and allowed them to rack up charges which although they have said we are not liable for  have failed to confirm in writing. We have no idea where we stand. My cat with a headset could have made a better go of it. I will never use BT or their services in any way  ever again. We will be referring to the Ombudsman  which they said we couldn't do (wrong again) as it still isn't formally resolved and now they just ignore us. Don't waste your time trying to resolve it with them. Cancel the direct debit  protect your funds and make them come to you. Anyone from BT reading this  look down the list. I'm not even remotely exaggerating about how bad our experience has been  and I doubt anyone else is. Good luck to you BT  you'll need it.~~~",Dorset~~~,2015-09-09~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is an absolute disgrace. I informed them about moving house 2 weeks in advance and 4weeks after having moved I am still waiting for my connection to be activated. They have made me wait half a day for an engineer twice. The appointments were not cancelled  BT simply didn't show up. I would strongly recommend to stay away from them !~~~,London~~~,2015-09-09~~~,1,1,3,3
In my opinion you are better off going elsewhere. I signed up to BT on the 18th August. After 2 engineers visits I am still  waiting for my broadband to work latest estimate is 11th September. The customer service is terrible and just read from scripts rather than actually helping.~~~,~~~,2015-09-09~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I wish I was able to give zero stars to this awful company. We're curently waiting for our 3rd connection appointment as their engineer missed the first 2. They didn't even bother phoning to inform us they wouldn't be turning up.

Two no shows of a technician after taking days off work. I was then told a technician would arrive at 1700 tonight so I could go to work  lies. I received a call at 1330 to say a technician was at my house. I then had to look like a liar at work and rush off as I was terrified that I would be put back to the back of the pile for another fictitious appointment.

Will never be going back to BT after they recently raised our line rental and fibre prices one month after signing up to a 12 month contract. Completely inflexible and charging new customers less than we are currently being charged even before the price hike. We will be leaving after having tried in vein to reason with several customer service reps.We've taken advantage of Ofcoms ruling that you can leave a fixed term telecoms contract within 30 days of an announced price hike and without penalty. We'll be taking our £130 topcashback payment from BT for singing up and we'll never be back. Thanks!~~~,Milton Keynes~~~,2015-09-06~~~,1,1,3,4
