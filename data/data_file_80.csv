Service liable to cut off even told network is busy yet I pay  and only get low speeds so presumably my low speed connection is cut off while others paying the same but with more than 10 times  my connection speed are getting service.~~~,"Swansea,UK~~~",2009-08-08~~~,~~~,~~~,1,~~~
It says my line's good for 6MB/S  i'm downloading/streaming at 7.1MB/S.  Always on  Very reliable.~~~,"St Columb Major, Cornwall~~~",2009-08-08~~~,5,5,5,5
we have never had wireless broadband  had to use ethernet cable  is so slow unbelievable. after numerous calls with very little useful help  engineer found we have a faulty service cable to property  still not fixed. quite often we have no access to internet at all for long periods of time  customer service is a lol. cost nearly 50 pound a month  bt vision not available at all. still given runaround every time we call  not to mention total chaos with biling. if we ever get a decent tel line  will change asap. in short bt a waste of money time ~~~,England~~~,2009-08-07~~~,1,1,1,1
At the moment I am paying Â£37 a month to receive between 150-380 kbps. Every time I complain it raises to about 1.4 mbps which is still not very good. Methinks it is time to stop the direct debit.~~~,NORFOLK~~~,2009-08-07~~~,1,1,1,1
The response from BT is good  but you are talking to somebody in India  although they are always polite and helpful  it is sometimes hard to understand them  I was told I could achieve up to 5megs if I went with BT  for months I never got more than 485 kbps downloading  I tried every way to try and improve the speed myself  but to no avail  I bought and fitted an Iplate  but got no improvement  I have spent endless phone calls to the BT help desk  they have eventually got my speed up to just over 2 megs downloading and around 450 kbps uploading ~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2009-08-07~~~,3,4,3,3
MAKE no mistake BT cost a bomb and charge TOO much  but in return you get an A1 service(24/7) and i've had 3 outages in 3 years lasting a total of 30 mins.~~~,MALV ERN worcester~~~,2009-08-06~~~,5,5,4,5
I am supposed to get at least 3mbps out of a package supposedly for 8mbps.  As I live less than two miles from the relevant exchane (in a straight line the download speed of 0.94 mbps and upload speed of .331mbps are absolutely appalling. I have complained  had the line checked  etc  etc  and all they can tell me is that the speed is unlkely to improve!  I cannot get a cable supplier  as the street I live in is paved  not tarmac  and  despite there being a utility strip down the side of the road  the cable companies will not lay it.~~~,Peterborough~~~,2009-08-06~~~,~~~,3,1,4
BT need to invest to maintain technical quality. I have just switched to Virgin~~~,North London~~~,2009-08-04~~~,3,4,~~~,3
When I chose BT I was told that I would get up to 8Mbs download speeds. When I run your speed test the reported speed of my line is recorded as being able to support 3.42 Mbs but the actual achieved speeds are reported as between 38 and 64 per cent less than I should be achieving.~~~,"Monkton, RAMSGATE< Kent.~~~",2009-08-03~~~,~~~,~~~,1,3
internet keeps going off when or just after I download films.. was pretty good until it went off on thursday 30 july . I called bt   was on phone for 3 hours on thursday. 4 hours on friday. 3 hours on saturday  1 hour sun morning. and I just tested my download speed which was 5.09~~~,easington colliery~~~,2009-08-02~~~,3,3,~~~,3
I have been with BT 18 Mths now and their service has been terrible. My broadband conection is so slow its only just above dial up speeds. ie not in Mb but messured in Ks and not even many of them . All i can say is the connection is stable but at this speed its sometimes quicker to post a letter. In the 18 mths my service has gone down 3 times each time taking days  to get put right~~~,Weston super Mare~~~,2009-08-02~~~,1,~~~,1,~~~
Broadband connection speed varies from 3000kbps down to 250 kbps depending on time of day. It is usually slow. Lines have been tested by engineer during visit to location and are OK. Modem router has been changed but results are the same on 2 independent computers.~~~,"Staffordshire, UK~~~",2009-08-02~~~,~~~,4,~~~,~~~
Considering I'm supposed to get around 3.91 and am only getting 2.5max on a good day.The sooner BT puts down cable then maybe the speed would be somewhat faster~~~,Llanelli~~~,2009-08-02~~~,~~~,3,~~~,~~~
Speed varies by 100% and is low in the late evenings i.e. midnight. The service is expensive and does not offer any significant advantage. Reporting faults can be a long drawn out process often with language difficulties. Especially annoying if you report the same fault several times and know the solution i.e. a reset of the board in the exchange which appears to have a software fault on it causing a lockup. If you want to stay with them and reduce your costs ask for a MAC code. When I did they discounted by 60% provided I signed up for 12 months. I still went ahead and signed up with Sky. Lets see how that goes!!~~~,Ossett~~~,2009-08-02~~~,3,3,~~~,3
For some time now have had consistently slow broadband speed well below that advertised and paid for. I shall be chnaging supplier very soon.~~~,west sussex~~~,2009-08-01~~~,1,1,1,4
as usual with BT you give up complaining.would not advise anyone to go to BT for broadband.unless they like talking to call centres that dont understand you.and know less than you about broadband.you spend hours going through BT help.then get the same from someone in a call centre.half the time not understanding them.cant wait till my contract is up.~~~,leominster~~~,2009-07-31~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
absolutly pathetic product and service   always get through to an Indian call centre and the staff don't seem very knowledgeable ... cant wait till contract is up will certainly move supplier~~~,DARLINGTON~~~,2009-07-30~~~,1,1,1,1
better than other supplier that i have at this address at least my broadband works 24/7 rather than not working for week in 3 mounths & the supplier taking a week or longer to get me up & running again yes my speed is not fast but that is due to the distance of my house to the exchange so it does not matter who my supplier is my speed will not change & with some suppliers it was actualy less (not sure how that happens) but at least with BT it has been reliable.~~~,Slough~~~,2009-07-30~~~,4,5,3,5

It would seem that BT have mis-sold me their deal. I have Total broadband 2 package that should include the phone deals etc  but I find myself at odds with them on every bill date. The line rental bit is always misleading and way over priced. I asked for co-ordinated monthly billing  as BT were still charging me two lots of line rental. I still don't get monthly billing  every time I query this their replies are off hand and arrogant  and nothing has been resolved! I am seriously~~~,Yeovil~~~,2009-07-29~~~,~~~,1,~~~,~~~
Not good service...Call centre in India some where..They said it would be 10 years or more until I can expect a better speed I'm getting 1.3 Mbs and paying for 8 Mbs. I live 1.7Kilometers from the exchange...Not good~~~,Bridgend Mid Glamorgan Wales UK~~~,2009-07-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Having conducted your B/Band speed test i am taken aback by the 193% slower than available to me. I realise that there are quite a few factors to be taken into account and that the advertised download speed is not to be taken at face value however  193% is  in any subscribers view  unacceptable. What i would like to know is  which ISP controls my local exchange (Lynemouth  Northumberland) as i have tried comparisons  ie; Orange  Talk Talk etc. and find that i can not get their package as advertised because they have to use someone elses system and pass the extra cost on  in order to provide me with B/Band  i suspect BT. To me  this is an anomally as everyone  no matter where they live should be able to get any package that is ADVERTISED. As far as connection is concerned  BT ADVERTISE that they have the best in the land  i say no. The times i have lost my connection is unbelievable compared to when i was with ORANGE aka WANADOO. Help???~~~,"Lynemouth, Northumberland~~~",2009-07-29~~~,~~~,3,~~~,3
Speed at best under 4mbps as opposed to the contract of 8mbps. Intermittant performance and various drop outs o occaisions.System needs to be greatly improved before I sign up again.~~~,Tonyrefail~~~,2009-07-29~~~,3,3,~~~,~~~

I really though I had bought a fast service but I tested it today after reading the reports in the press and instead of 8MB i had 0.8MB. Not good enough I will change supplier (currently BT)~~~,London~~~,2009-07-28~~~,3,3,1,3
