"This company is such a flaming pile of rubbish that I do not even know where to start. We ordered our broadband 5/9/2017 and today a month later nothing has happened. An engineer came by to set up our phone line which doesn't work and has at no point worked. He told us they would be back to set up the broadband and never contacted us again. We have spent over £50 on phone calls trying to reach BT's impenetrable ""customer service"" 3 times a week for the past month trying to chase down our order to see if any developments are taking place. We have been redirected countless times and told that we would receive a phone call from their offline specialist team over and over again (countless times). We have received one phone call from the offline teams which came two weeks after we initially noticed that something is not right. The offline team couldn't help us at all and made us wait over 7 business days for their follow up phone call only to be told that ""our phone line is already working"" and that they cannot find our address on their database to organize the broadband over. There seems to be no consistency in their company-wide customer service as every time we called confused wondering where our broadband is  no one had any idea what was going on with our case  forcing us  the customer  to explain our situation to countless customer service agents over and over again. This company had the audacity to shamelessly take 7 business days ""to get back to us"" every time we called to make an inquiry on our order  and insisted time after time that our totally functionless and mute phone line is working  even after we BOUGHT A PHONE specifically for testing our phone line. This company COULD'VE been honest with us from the beginning and told us they cannot deliver us services as our address doesnt exist in their database. BUT NO. This company COULD HAVE some sort of basic ""high priority"" policy for customers that have had their unresolved case dragged out for weeks in order to speed up the process. BUT NO. This company COULD add details of progression in their customer service systems so that when we call  our server could easily check the developments of our order on their on systems. However  this utterly disfunctional and unacceptably disrespectful scam that BT calls a ""company"" has failed to do any of the above  or anything else for that matter to assist us. Even on our final phone call to them which cost us £8  the customer service agent had nothing else to say besides ""why didn't you use a phone box to call us to avoid spending so much money?"" We have finally cancelled our order and are absolutely mortified over being totally scammed and had our time and money wasted for an entire month. Now we are eagerly awaiting our refund which will hopefully arrive in ""5-10 business days"".....~~~",Manchester~~~,2017-10-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Please avoid this vile company like the playground.criminals in suits comes to mind. My bill doubled over the last two years when confronted they came back with a cock and bull story.The TV package broke after a few month I never used it never use the landline and the broadband was average.you just get put through to a call center and my god can those people lie.shame on you BT for misleading the public and robbing them of their hard earned cash.Total disgrace the of you.~~~,Manchster~~~,2017-10-11~~~,1,1,3,3
DO NOT GO WITH BT!! We set up BT and the extras that came with our package (bt sport and BT player) didn't work! When trying to contact them we were made to wait 3 hours and after demanding to speak to a manager we were told someone would contact us back. No one called us back and after attempting to call them back a further two times we remain unable to get through to the manager and the problem still remains. WHATEVER YOU DO DO NOT GO WITH BT!!!~~~,Colchester~~~,2017-10-10~~~,1,1,2,1
good speed when it works. wifi frequently drops connection. tv box (connected via ethernet) also losses connection. wifi signal poor even in next room (despite saying it's the uk's most powerful router?!) customer service is truly appalling~~~,Littleborough~~~,2017-10-09~~~,1,1,3,2
This internet connection is payed for. Why doesn't it work reliably? An advertised 2mb/s connection repeatedly cuts to nothing! Unacceptable! I can understand that it ight slow during high traffic but his is 4 am in th morning  the infrastructure doesn't dissapear overnight and there is no excuse for denial of service. I am actually having to use my mobile to submit this because your pathetice internet has entirely cut out while my lan amd modem are still fully functioning. wtf~~~,Northern Ireland~~~,2017-10-07~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are saying that they won't honour their £50 cashback as there is something on my browser that ensures it goes through EasyFundraising. EasyFundraising is a free service that allows charities and good causes to raise money when their supporters shop online. Businesses such as BT sign up to donate a percentage of the sale to charity. I donate my percentage to the MNDA as my aunt died of Motor Neurones Disease last year. It seems really underhand that BT would try to use this loophole to prevent paying out to customers an agreed amount of cash back.

"Recently  I chatted with BT to ask some information regarding their services. Every time I tried  they refused to provide those information and they tried to push me to subscribe a contract despite I did not want to. I explained I was just looking for some information as I was going to move to a new home 2 months later but  eventually  they convinced me to subscribe a contract stating prices will increase and promising me I will not pay any money until the activation date. Further to that  I tried to postpone my activation date but  despite this changed on their website  I did not receive a confirmation and I decided to contact them. They assured me the activation was postponed but  when I messaged them on Facebook  they told me it was not. Also  I discovered they issued a bill and started debiting before the service was activated. I chatted with them but they refused to deal with my complaint and transferred my call to people who transferred my call to other people and so on. Every time  they just told me: ""Please  ignore the bill"". Of course  as I did not want to pay for something that has never been activated  I asked them to cancel my order  close the account and cancel the bill. They cancelled the order but my account is still open and there is a message stating I will receive my first bill. Despite I have chatted and phoned them many times explaining this situation  they refused to deal with it. They told me my account is closed when it is open and I can access to it. They told me I will not receive any bill when there is a bill in there with my financial details. They refused to put this in write so I formally complained without receiving any reply. Their customer service is shocking and they provide different answers every time. They do not accept or deal with complaints. They charge people for service never activated. I do not understand how they can still be able to trade.~~~",Manchester~~~,2017-10-06~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I've never written a bad review before  but honestly this whole saga has caused us so much grief I had to.  BT have been the most incompetent company I have ever had the displeasure to deal with.  We called up when moving house to upgrade to high speed fiber and set up the new address  we were told there was an available line and calling in advance we would be ready for moving in day. This date came  nobody arrived and upon calling we were told the line was unfortunately in use  informing us they can't kick off the non existent other person so we have to pay to install another line and had to wait for an engineer. They told us the date we were supposed to be set up and even received a confirmation text that our engineer was arriving.Seeing a BT van on the road with a man looking confused I went outside and spoke to him. The engineer was only there to install a line outside  I spoke to this man who was confused with conflicting information and after several calls it turns out we hadn't been informed our account was on hold  despite confirmation that day and they had the wrong property details due to the initial person who set us up writing our details incorrectly. Since the engineer was here he checked and the line which was apparently in use was perfectly fine and only needed to be turned on. He also informed me that if someone had left the line open they can infect kick them off  he had no idea why I was told that and he didn't understand why BT hasn't just turned our line on. When calling up to sort this issue we were told we had to wait a further two weeks so they could send out an engineer to turn the line on. Two weeks past  nobody arrived.  We called up to sort out the issue  we were promised a months free broadband for our troubles and told they didn't even have an order for another engineer  and would have to wait until tomorrow so they could find out what was wrong. We called back tomorrow to sort out the issue  they told us they never give compensation and cannot authorise a months free broadband. They told us we could intact get an expidited engineer as we have been waiting so long.   Nobody came  we rang up  they informed us the order for an expidited engineer was rejected  despite recieving confirmation. They put in another request and we had to wait a few days again.  Of course this was then rejected again  we were informed expidited engineers only get out through if the delay is their fault. Which it was. The customer service representative apologised but said the earliest we could get set up was the 7th of October. We put our application in on the 18th of august. We respectfully asked if we could cancel our order and moved to a different service provider  plusnet.  We receive a bill for £500 early cancellation fee  of the broad and I we  never got to use. We call up and they agree it must be an error  which is still to be rectified as we are still recieving bills.  Our plusnet was supposed to be turned on today. We call up  and it turns out BT have disconnected our line! You've cost myself and my partner a fortune in mobile data & stress.  Thanks BT. BRILLIANT SERVICE.~~~,Wales~~~,2017-10-04~~~,1,1,1,1
the singularly most unashamedly useless company i have had the displeasure of being a customer of largely because no one else would provide broadband in my rural patch. their customer services is diabolical and at one stage they left us for 7 days with no telephone line or broadband and then hiked the tariff. i am finally rid of them but the new provider was left stranded as they could not access the exchange open reach cabinet. cant even say it was a good riddance!!~~~,Leicestershire~~~,2017-10-04~~~,2,2,2,1
"Had a terrible time with BT and have been a loyal customer for years.  They offer such enticing deals to new customers ""cash back cards!"" ""free installation!"" but when you end up out of contract and paying £40.99 for 12MB broadband and they offer you a subpar deal compared to new customers I thought it was time to leave. I made arrangements for NOW TV to take over the line and everything looked like it was working fine until I was informed by NOW TV that BT had cancelled the order mid process because I had asked them to...?! Was then without broadband for 4 weeks and spent over 4 hours on the phone to BT to try get it fixed. 3 engineer visits later (first they sent a telephone engineer to fix a broadband fault  then they cancelled the engineer at 5.45pm when i was told to wait from between 1-6pm for the visit and finally on the third visit after 3 days off work and another 2 hours on the phone  they got it working again. FANTASTIC my 12MB overpriced broadband is up and running again. So... About 10 different BT representatives some of whom PROMISE to call back on XX day and never do or text saying will call in a few minutes AND NEVER DO. Over four hours on the phone to BT via India  Cardiff  Newcastle you name the location... I've been on hold there. Being forced to listen to their infuriating on hold music. 3 engineer visits to fix the problem and THEY STILL cant tell me what the issue was. All the time they are direct debiting my account for more money. The compensation? £60...£10 for each missed engineer £20 for not having broadband for a month and £20 as a ""goodwill gesture""?!   Id love to leave them but Im scared they will pull the plug and leave me without broadband again. BT ARE TERRIBLE PLEASE AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!~~~",London~~~,2017-10-04~~~,1,1,1,3
Would not pay BT customer service with washers they have NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL. We have been with them 15 weeks  without mobile service for 2 weeks as they cut my husband off for no reason  forgot to port our landline number from previous provider  we had 2 different temporary number am took 1 monTh to sort it out  not had a correct bill for 3 months STILL TRYING TO SORT IT OUT~~~,Burnley~~~,2017-10-04~~~,2,1,2,2
Please listen to the reviews on here and do not make the mistake of signing up for BT broadband - it is truly terrible.  Moved over from TalkTalk  thought it couldn't get any worse  turns out it does.  The expected speed for fibre optic broadband in our area is approx 33mb/s. I have just performed a test and currently have a whopping 0.29mb/s. I understand speeds can vary but this is at 1pm on a Tuesday afternoon..  When contacted BT all they can offer is an engineer to come and assess the line at a cost of £130 because their 'tests' show its a problem with the part of the line I'm responsible for...convenient. I was getting speeds of 15mb/s with TalkTalk only last month so have difficulty believing their opinion.  The customer service is terrible and the speeds are worse.  Avoid.~~~,Newcastle upon Tyne~~~,2017-10-03~~~,1,1,1,2
This rubbish and worst company even not deserve one star. I have applied broadband at dated June 03  2017. Even after passing 50 days  i did not get internet and at dated July 25  I have requested to cancel due to no longer required. I explained the reason to one  then he transfers to next then transfer to next. same reason I explain to everyone and line dropped. then called back and again explained to 2-3 staff members then again line dropped. no one called me back. then I traveled outside country and I received bill coz the line was not being canceled. so far today as of oct 2  2017  after passing 4month  I have called more than 15 times  spent more than 3 hours in call holding/talking and up to today I am not able to get rid of this rubbish. one says the service is being canceled  the other says not canceled.is there any senior staff of this company looking this review or we just wasting time to write this review.~~~,PUDSEY~~~,2017-10-02~~~,1,1,1,1

Premium prices for average service!I'm writing this review in regards to my parents  my first complaint goes back a few months  where they were sold a ridiculous package by a pushy salesperson  My parents are in there mid 70s and don't really use the internet that much  but they were still recommended a premium product which made there total monthly payment around £60-£70 per month. I was absolutely livid when I found out that these companies push there product on pensioners who don't really know better  and to be honest the internet connection was not that great.Recently I spent a few days trying to sort this out  my parents are from an age where loyalty is rewarded  and have been with BT for 45 years. After numerous calls and being put on hold BT finally offered a £5 discount per month...I'm not sure what planet BT is on but I have now changed them to another provider who delivers a better internet service but the bills are coming in at around £22 per month  a massive difference.I can't recommend BT  and find them to be just a bunch of cowboys living off a past reputation...~~~,London~~~,2017-09-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Ordered on the basis of a cheap offer in June. Had nothing but headaches since then. Pay £100  £200 more a year if you have to  to work with someone else. Customer support lack basic record keeping  access to solve problems  ability to understand things or escalate  BT will do things and then customer service staff won't be able to tell you who did them and why  and they will point blank tell you they cannot solve your problem. Your order can fail silently on the day of installation  get closed  and then you can have BT bill you for early termination  and leave you having to contact them to get them to fix this. And when you phone up they just say they can refund your bank and place a new order  they can't fix the earlier one  with weeks more delay. Go with someone who can actually do their job.~~~,Dorchester~~~,2017-09-29~~~,1,1,4,1
BT's offering is way below par! The connection is ridiculously slow and other times  we cannot connect at all. Complained to Customer Services and they were of very little help. In fact  they were rude and obnoxious. They need to all be sent on some form of training course in effective customer service. Simply awful! Will never go back to BT for as long as I shall live.~~~,London~~~,2017-09-28~~~,1,1,1,1
I have left sky to come across to Bt fibre - big mistake.Your engineer installed equipment on Friday 22nd Sept but could not activate as the routing given to the exchange was full. Therefore left me with no broadband as Bt had told Sky to disconnect. Various phone calls to Bt mainly result in being put on hold for up to an hour . Told nothing could be done until Monday. I then had to chase on Monday to see what's happening!! . Told job had to be cancelled and new job issued . Told to phone back Tuesday. 2 calls later on Tuesday told engineer needs to come out on Wednesday. This is complete opposite to what engineer said needs to happen . Chased engineer up on Wednesday as no one turned up . Told he was the same engineer and they had given him same routing as before so not coming out and said BT are useless as it happens all the time . I then have to spend another hour on phone to BT who blame open reach and say we will update you on Thursday. I have been without broadband for 6 days now and surprisingly no call from BT today . I don't know what's worse the fact that BT don't seem to care and fob you off or that they don't actually know what they're doing . To add insult I did receive an email to say my first bill will be sent out on the 8th October!!!!~~~,Epsom ~~~,2017-09-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Much like the many reviews on here - Abysmal service.  The broadband has stopped working at my house. I've spoken to BT 12 times in the last week and they still haven't been able to resolve my issue.  Been told the Hub is broke and I should buy a new one. (Their words!  they wouldn't send me a new one due to contract issues even though been a customer for over 10 years). The new one I bought didn't work. Rung them again. Was told it has nothing to do with the hub and it's an issue in the household. Will send an engineer on Tuesday. I booked a day off work. The next day I was told it was not internal but an external issue. They sent the engineer and Proclaimed it was fixed. It clearly wasn't. Rang again. On hold for 45 minutes. Cut off. Rang again. Was promised a call back. No call back. Rang again. They told me it should be working. No. Rang again. Cut off. Rang again. Told me it was an internal issue! Said they couldn't send an engineer out til next week.......I give up.  Would be quicker to train as an engineer and fix it myself.~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2017-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I was hoping that by leaving a bad review BT might sit up and listen - but with so many terrible reviews they can't care at all. I've just spent ages on the phone again trying to get fibre optic installed in our home - and I could hear loads of other similar calls going on in the background. It actually made me feel sorry for their call teams. It must be soul destroying to work for such a poor customer service company. I ordered fibre optic in the beginning of July. The lady on the phone said it would be installed two weeks later and gave me a date and time - I stressed that I would have to take time off of work and get staff in  so would be costly to me. So I wanted to know someone would definitely turn up (having been let down so many times before by BT on our business line). Naturally nobody arrived - no phone call - only the equipment was delivered as promised. Numerous phone calls and ten weeks later I've just called them again. Two weeks after the promised return phone call from them that never happened. This time I have been told that there is a fault with two packages being on the account (one the old copper and one the new fibre) - but I should be pleased because I am only paying for one even though the fibre hasn't been installed. And this had stopped progression of the order?? What is a girl to do? All I want is to upgrade from copper to fibre  as all their adverts suggest. Our copper is well below the acceptable download/upload rates and frankly not worth a penny. But apparently that is our fault for living in a rural area. So  the outcome - a complaint has been raised (AGAIN)  and the issue has been escalated (AGAIN). It is in their hands and they will be in touch within five working days apparently. Not holding my breath that a) we will get a call or b) it will be a call worth taking and anything has actually happened. If you can avoid using BT then I would strongly recommend you do!~~~,Wales~~~,2017-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
The following is an email sent to the ombudsman regarding BT.For over a year I have noticed that the downloading of files is very slow in the late afternoon using BT infinity service. The reason for this became clear when I purchased a Samsung 4K HDR TV on 25/11/16 which requires a minimum of 25kbps to play a Netflix 4K HDR program  the Netflix app is also able to measure the kbps supplied via BT. When using both Netflix and BT’s own wholesale speed tests I discovered that between 5pm and midnight every day the speed slowly goes down to as low as 2mbps  the lowest normally between 9pm and 10pm. The contract I signed up to with BT stated I would receive a minimum of 34mbps minus 1 to 2mbps in peak periods. Contacting BT on their help line proved to be a long and frustrating process as I was told to contact them when the fault was present and then they can do a line test. Contacting them between 9 and 10pm proved to be impossible as I could be on hold for as long as 45 minutes before being disconnected  this was the case from January to May 2017. I also purchased the latest smart hub from BT but was left with same problem.+Desperate for a solution I contacted the help line in the morning and requested them to contact me at 9pm  as I was unable to get through to them  which they did and a test was done which was 4kbps and they admitted there was obviously a fault. To-date I have had four engineers visits each one clearing my property and equipment and saying that the fault is external i.e. is a BT supply or equipment issue. The situation now is even worse  there have been too many helpline telephone conversations to list but below is just a small example of recent events.27/07/17-ENGINEER CLAIMED HE HAD FOUND A HOT CONNECTION IN THE EXCHANGE AND SOLVED THE FAULT. SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT.28/07/17- SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT.29/07/17-  SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT.30/07/17-  SLOW SPEED EVENING FAULT STILL PRESENT  ALSO SERVICE IS NOW INTERMITTANT.31/07/17- NO INTERNET CONNECTION. WHOLESALE ENGINEER MADE A SCHEDULED VISIT AND CLAIMED IT WAS A CABLE DAMAGE PROBLEM  LATER IN THE DAY HE SAID IT WAS BT EQUIPMENT IN DISTRIBUTION CABINET AT FAULT AND HE WAS NOT AUTHOURISED TO TOUCH THIS EQUIPMENT.1/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE.2/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE.3/08/17- INTERMITTANT SERVICE UNTIL 6PM  AFTER 6PM SERVICE IS OK AND NIGHT TIME SPEEDS ARE 34MBPS.4/08/17- VISIT FROM ENGINEER CHECKED  MY EQUIPMENT  SAID OK AND THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MAJOR CABLE FAULT.5/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE. HELPLINE HAD AUTOMATED MESSAGE SAYING FAULT WILL BE FIXED IN TWO HOURS - IT WAS NOT.6/08/17- NO INTERNET SERVICE. HELPLINE HAD AUTOMATED MESSAGE SAYING FAULT REPAIRED RESET YOUR HUB - STILL NO SERVICE.7/08/17- SERVICE CAME ONLINE AT AROUND 3PM  NETFLIX NOW SAYS CANNOT CONNECT ANY OF ITS THREE SERVERS. CONTACTED BT HELPLINE AS I HAD BEEN PROMISED A CALL FROM A CASE HANDLER  HELPLINE SAID  I WILL DEFINITELY BE CONTACTED BEFORE 6PM BUT  AGAIN  DID NOT RECEIVE A CALL.8/08/17- INTERMITTANT SERVICE.9/08/17- A 7pm speed  test with both Netflix and BT Wholesale  gave speeds of 5 and 10mbps. Still not received the promised call from BT.I would like to stress that the above is only a small fraction of the telephone conversations I have had with BT.Each time I contact BT they try to convince me that this is an isolated fault but everyone I have spoken to in the Arnside area has been having exactly the same internet problems with BT infinity. I have also been offered a partial refund by a gentleman called Joseph which turned out to be a credit for a product that is not fit for purpose. As BT are unable or unwilling to deal with the poor internet performance I intend to change my internet supplier as I cannot spend any more time on this farcical situation  and think it is not unreasonable to receive a full refund for a service contract I signed up to but have never received.  Further information as requested.18/08/2017- BT (Daniel) phoned at 20.00hrs and asked if the problem was solved. I informed him the evening fault was no more but now I am only receiving a constant 27mbps  not the minimum 34mbps as advertised. He also admitted as I had previously had daytime speeds of around 36mbps there was no reason they could not be achieved now. He then arranged an engineer’s visit for 21/08/2017. When the engineer arrived his instrument showed a speed of 29mbps but said he could not investigate further as BT had told him 24mbps was acceptable  I was shown and read this communication from BT. The same day I logged on to the BT website which stated if I signed another contract with them they calculated I would receive a minimum of 36mbps to 49mbps.This is a good and typical example of BT. I have personally witnessed many test results at my property only to be told a completely different reading days later by BT.I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your efforts on my behalf but I do not expect a result in my favour as I do not expect an accurate record of events from BT  this being my conclusion after months of dealing with this company.~~~,Cumbria~~~,2017-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I joined BT because they had an Infinity fiber deal. Before the end of the contract I had to change my address and called BT to transfer my broadband to the new address. They told me that at the new address I can't get Infinity fiber  although fiber was available at the new address  they just had two same flat numbers on their website and mixed the address up. They attracted me into a Copper Broadband contract with slow speeds  promising that when fiber will be available I will be upgraded with no extra cost. Now they want me to pay extra if I want Infinity Fiber. Had a lot of phone calls and chats with their customer service but they failed to solve my problem. You talk to them and then nothing happens  the problem persists. Once they trap you in a contract you are just a good cash machine for them. Unreliable broadband and service. And the worst customer service I have ever experienced in my life. Never again BT. This is my experience with them.~~~,Chester~~~,2017-09-26~~~,1,1,1,1
I am very disappointed with their service.Joined them a month ago.They messed it up before we joined them and now not even a month after we have no internet at all called them a few times and it is like I am talking to a robot computer says no and been advised that it will take 3 days to sort the fault.It is the second day today no feedback at all. Such a crucial time with no internet as It has messed up my daughter's homeworks.Besides all thiese problems I joined them as they had an offer to get a reward card but now they refuse to give me my reward card.~~~,Northolt~~~,2017-09-23~~~,1,1,1,1

I could write pages of frustrating rants here  but I dont want to re-live it all. In short it took me over 18 months to finally get the billing and BB sorted to the original request. It has cost me a fortune in wasted time and extra billing costs. Warning: BT customer service is abysmal just want to fob you off and then deny what you have been told.Impossible to tranfser your old number despite being told that can.Refunds promised on purchase never materialised.They put things on your bill without telling you e.g. BT sport. Then insist that I requested it and wont refund.Were charging for an old BT email address (despite having several free with the package) as it was on an old server; and couldn't/wouldn't take it off the bill!The hardware does not function to specification (infinity) and frequently drops out but am told to reset and there are no faults on the line.Mix this with long delays waiting for customer service  poor assistance when you get someone - do yourself a favour and find another company!~~~,Nothumberland~~~,2017-09-21~~~,1,1,3,2
Broadband deteriorated so called BT. After doing a speed test myself told it was my 'old hub' which wax out of warranty. Good news I was almost out of contract so could get a new deal with new hub 'probably cheaper than current contract. Great! Transferred to sales. My contract was actually had over another year to run and my hub was in warranty. Transferred back to faults who had misinformed me as they could send me a new hub free of charge. Great! They would only send next version. On complaining they agreed to send latest smart hub to arrive in a few days. Email confirmation tells me my order is heading for someone else's address?! I ring and have another 2 hours on phone. It's 'a system fault' apparently. They place another order to my address to arrive today. Email tells me it's on its way for delivery. It never arrived. I contact on line help get transferred from order management team to technical team and back to order management who then hang up. On my account are 3 orders for smart hubs but who has then I wonder cos let's face it it's not me. Do I contact BT tomorrow for another round of complaints and 2 hours of my life I won't get back. If this is a quality service for the £37 I pay each month then who are they kidding.~~~,England~~~,2017-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Avoid BT  unfortunately  during a move of house I wanted a better wireless router and used the opportunity to move to BT. The Smart Hub 6 is the worst router I've used  I've had three of them and they reboot at least twice a day  not great when streaming my TV via the wifi. I got a Hub 4 and the reboots never occurred  but the signal was awful due to the very low spec of this.  The BT customer service experience was horrendous  clueless and all they ever wanted to do was run a line test  despite the fault clearly being with the router. Every call with them was at least 45 mins  same crap on every call. Still trying to break out of my contract due to the poor service  will never use BT for any service again.~~~,West Sussex~~~,2017-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1

I was a happy Plusnet customer with no real issues  however  I was unfortunately tempted away by a BT sales representative who promised me the world  but in reality my experience has been very different.Initially I had constant problems with the Home Hub 6 and its WiFi. Every time I rang the technical department I was either given a solution that failed to solve the problem or more often than not I was cut off before completing my conversation  leaving me and my entire family frustrated and often without a WiFi service. I was sent a replacement HH6 which did not resolve the issue and eventually I was sent a HH5 which did thankfully cure the problem and since then I have had no techical issues since However  the customer service and billing have continued to be well below standard. My latest bill included a £65 charge supposedly for asking to leave the broadband service early  something I didn't ask for or was discussed with anyone at BT. When I tried to resolve this by phone  I spoke to an advisor who initially tried to tell me the £65 charge wasn't actually a cancellation fee as stated but rather a charge for one of the routers? When I explained this wasn't the case as the only router that worked was the HH5  He put me on hold and never returned  leaving me hanging on the phone for 20 minutes + listening to ""On Hold"" music. I then tried to ring back later only to be put in a queue with no answer  and when BT turned their phone lines off at 9pm I was cut off despite waiting 45 minutes for a reply. I then attempted to contact BT via the online chat  eventually after a 30 minute wait I spoke to a lady call advisor who initially told me the £65 was credited back to my account in a payment of £75.95 to my account in July. I explained that this was incorrect and the £75 95 credit was a refund promised to me for leaving my previous provider Plusnet early to cover their early cancellation fee. BT repaid me the charges made to me by Plusnet. She then said I would receive a £65 refund to my account  She also insisted I should ""relax"" something that I feel wasn't appropriate at the time. When I demanded that I wanted to escalate my complaint to a supervisor  She stalled for a while and eventually passed my complaint over to a supervisor.He asked what could be done to resolve my complaint and I explained I wanted early cancellation of my contract with no cancellation fees as I felt the service isn't fit for purpose. He told me he couldn't do this and would have to escalate this further and promised me a callback in 48 hours. No callback was made to me  despite being promised and yet again I had to contact them via the online chat. I spoke to an advisor who told me I would receive a call tomorrow. After explaining the promise made by the supervisor  I eventually received another call from another supervisor who explained he failed to callback as he was tied up with another complaint (A complaint that appears to have taken 48 hours) Again  he claimed it wasn't something he couldn't deal with and I again have been promised yet another callback that could happen at anytime over the past week. (I have no confidence it will happen at all). Had I have known what poor customer service BT had I would have never have left my previous ISP Plusnet. I have no desire to remain a BT customer  as I feel I have been treated very badly. Promises have been made that haven't been kept  money taken out of my account that shouldn't have been and I have had to constantly endure terrible customer service in an attempt to resolve the problems created by BT~~~",Dewsbury~~~,2017-09-20~~~,1,1,4,3
Unbelievably arrogant. I had TV  phone  broadband and mobile service with this bunch of cowboys. I had an issue with mobile service  they refused to compromise so I have now cancelled everything - they have achieved a short term gain  but will now lose me as a customer forever.~~~,Ipswich~~~,2017-09-20~~~,1,1,3,2
Wish there was a minus scale! terrible company the worst customer service I have ever had even from the managers. The managers hanged up on me and the BT staff of many occasions lied to me. Took 2 months for them to install my phone line I gave up in the end and got sky out and they installed within 1 week dont ever use them!!!~~~,Colchester~~~,2017-09-19~~~,1,1,1,1
The worst customer service I have ever received! The audacity of calling my firm and then hanging up on me in the space of 3 seconds when I trying to assist!  Words do not describe fully my anger to BT Connect's employees! I will never take a call from them again. Suitability of their employees recruited seriously need to be reviewed. That or BT are the best show case of poor customer service culture.~~~,Godalming~~~,2017-09-19~~~,1,1,3,2
Wish could give them 0! Terrible terrible service  lying to customers and it has been two months and they couldn't get phone line installed. What a joke!~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-09-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Literally the worst broadband I've ever experienced. Cuts out at 11pm EVERY NIGHT for anywhere between 30mins to 3 hours. Complaints and requests to resolve the issue have been met with the telephone equivalent of blank stares - despite the fact that BT are obviously resetting their system at this time every night. Truly terrible. Like being back in the early 2000s.~~~,Ealing~~~,2017-09-18~~~,1,1,3,1
The worst product service ever  i will never use them again!~~~,exter~~~,2017-09-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Can't wait to finish the contract  bad experience with customer service. The router is advertised as most powerful when it comes to signal but is the worst router I have ever had. Try to obtain the id and password to instal my own router but the customer service failed to help me. We live in a flat and the signal can't travel from living room to my bedroom or my kid bedroom and let me tell you is not a huge apartment. The router resets at least 3 times per day and that in the middle of the move  very frustrating.All in one bad experience with bt fibre.~~~,Swanage~~~,2017-09-18~~~,1,1,5,1
Terrible service once again from BT! We were just waiting for our contract to finish in January because the fibre optic is so bad but we are moving.  So we have to tie into another contract for 12 months on cable.  It's a joke! Can't wait to leave!~~~,~~~,2017-09-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Was a long-term customer of BT. A while ago I tried to move to an advertised Infinity package to be told that this was for new customers only and my package would be nearly twice advertised. So I recently decided to move. After ringing BT to confirm transfer date I was given the hard sell about offers BT could give me and it concluded with the person implying it was my fault I had been paying £££ as I hadn't been on the phone to them to negotiate  and that I had been lying about the previous conversation where I was penalised for being an existing customer. BT used to be good but a bit pricey. Now their broadband is average  their technical support is patchy at best and  based on my last phone call  their customer service is truly awful.  BT are a bit better than the very worst broadband suppliers but nowhere near the better suppliers - the technical support which was better than others has become steadily worse as well. They still charge a premium and  based on my experience  treat their long-term customers with contempt. What has happened to this company?~~~,London~~~,2017-09-16~~~,1,1,1,3
Horrible  shocking Customer Services  I have been promised 12mbpi speed of internet  and I'm getting 1.5 Mbps. I don't have access to BT TV  and yet I'm paying £37.7 a month.   I called BT  and I have more than 1000 minutes worth of airtime with them  I never managed to talk with the right people to get the service cancelled  or price negotiated.  All I get is people working from India who doesn't sort out anything  and they keep transferring the calls. In most of the cases   I genuinely think they intentionally hang up the phone on me. I'm so disgusted and frustrated with the whole process. Can Ofcom please help out on this. I'm unhappy with the BT services; I just want to cancel the services.  Any internet provider out there who intends to take this desperate customer who pays the bills on time and loyal. Shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking~~~,"Sprowstown, Norwich~~~",2017-09-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
