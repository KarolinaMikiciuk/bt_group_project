Wish I hadn't bothered to go with B.T. My internet speed is 1.8mbps and download is about .7 on a good day. I have spent hours speaking to customer services and to be honest I wish I could cancel my contract. My speed at night can drop below .8 Mbps but because they check during the day when there isn't so much demand on the service...any other provider couldn't be worse than these~~~,Crewe~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,1,1,1
terrible service - use broadband everyday and although I live in the 'near' countryside  expecting with fibre optics to get 15GBI end up getting less than 10 - and even 5 most daysthe broadband 'sticks' and web pages stick most timesalso - I DO NOT like the way they add sneaky little extras like 'display view'with TPS on the bill - I do not have a display phone  still get loads of unwanted calls (about 3+ a day)and when I try to remove the option  it is so complicated to understand the choices (they have a sneaky way of hiding options) that you give up in case you choose something worse!~~~,halifax~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,1,1,1
BT Broadband is just dire and is only matched by the service which is even more dire. They insist the broadband dropping out numerous times per day or so slow it won't even laod a simple website is working properly and a formal complain acknowledged in writing has not even been actioned months later. Just don't bother.~~~,Bromley~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
The worst customer service - Disgraceful for such a big brand.   They do not answer the phone. You end up in a queue and it then just cuts you off after 15 mins.  This happened to me 4 times in a row this morning.   Wifi is rubbish - signal keeps dropping from all devices.~~~,Herts~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Non existient customer service  unreliable bband connection  billing errors and inability to handle simple reqest like transferring the service to new address. Constant calls from their rude sales team.~~~,Reading~~~,2016-07-20~~~,1,1,3,1
I went with bt when I was told not too  only wanted to go with them as I wanted bt sport I joined at January and still can't get it now I have given up ringing them as you never can understand what there saying just can't wait till new year so I can get rid of this useless contract and next time I might listen to what people say when they tell me not to bother with a company~~~,Forton somerset~~~,2016-07-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Poor!Poor!Poor!. My broadband was supposed to be on on the 19th June. Writing this review on the 19th of July! Still not working  I was told it should work by midnight tonight. Applied on the 6th of June. On my engineers visit of the 18th no one turned up. On the Saturday sent me a new order ref  and put my service back to 19 July. Appartently there was a Glitch on the system and they could not bring my date forward  so had to wait till today. I received a tect at 11 am this morning that my broadband should now be working  Still Not!! Do yourself a favour and stay away!! There are more professional companies out there. BT  pls stop scamming people with your adverts to join Up. Cant even help the ones that are already signed up All they can say on the 25 calls I made to them is Sorry...Sorry...Sorry... Never again in my life!~~~,"Belgravia, London~~~",2016-07-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Think twice before subscribing to BT Broadband unless you want to be charged £60 for exceeding your broadband usage limit for which BT say I have used but I have no explanation for only use broadband for browsing nothing else standard broadband very poor anyway --- very unsatisfied customer~~~,Ky154gxgordon.kidd@gmail.com~~~,2016-07-19~~~,1,2,1,1
I decided to use BT for my new restaurant and it's been a nightmare since the beginning. 1. They first got my order wrong: we agreed for fibre and they installed ADSL2. When I notified it  they said sorry we will sort it out. No one ever bother to call me back despite their promises by chat or by text.3. After I chased them  they finally raised a new order that was cancelled 10 days after without any explanation or notification.4. I chased again to get a new order. An engineer eventually came onsite to install the order but said he could not do it because the line was not ready for fiber.5. 10 days later another engineer came to say exactly the same.6. 10 days later another engineer came again for the same result (this is not a joke!)7. Today  I am still waiting for someone to get back to me with an explanation.In the meantime they of course did not forget to take my money. When I asked them to get access to my online account they told me they could not do it because I don't have my details (I am a new customer  I did not receive anything). I replied OK  give me my details. They told me to ask my bank in order to get my BT account number!!!! They are my supplier but can't give me my account number!!!! 3 months after having suscribed  I am left with no fibre  no invoice  nothing but with hundreds of pounds debited on my account. Really awful service!~~~,London~~~,2016-07-18~~~,1,1,1,1
I wish there was a zero star for rating because BT sucks slow internet connection sometimes it doesn't even connect. I am just waiting for the 12 months contracts. As soon as it's over I am gonna throw this Broadbrand in the bin~~~,~~~,2016-07-18~~~,1,1,1,1
"Ignore the word ""CONTRACT"" It means nothing.Prices went up within 6 months on the pretext of better service and because line rental went up.Not seen any difference in sevice  yet Cant wait to get away from them BUT What do you go for? these companies all have their snouts in the same trough!!!~~~",LANCASHIRE~~~,2016-07-18~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT many years  however within the last 18 months (since getting the latest versions of their 'Home Hubs' the reliability has become so poor that I am moving provider. The connection drops out/resets several times a week - I use the connection for streaming and gaming  so a stable connection is crucial. When you ring support to ask why it has dropped out  they're unable to provide a solution and you're told that unless the connection is dropping more than 6 times a day  they will not consider sending out an engineer. Successive replacement Home Hubs have not resolved the issue. The speed is good but if you depend on reliability  do not go with BT. Wifi is also poor - even when close to the router  the speed is either slow or the connection just seems to randomly drop out. Better providers out there that provide better value for money and greater reliability.~~~,"London, UK~~~",2016-07-17~~~,1,1,3,1
Like previous reviews I wish I could give zero stars.  In short do not touch them  go elsewhere.  I have engineers out twice and told there is no problems.  Hub fine  wiring fine and yet the BT Affinity spends more time down than up.  Last engineer discovered that BT were actually 'suppressing' the line and I was only getting 11meg and was paying for 40meg connection.  Please don't waste your time or money with them~~~,Essex~~~,2016-07-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible service  we have an issue with Internet and phone connection....we have been on the phone since 9am this morning....2 hours latter and the clowns at BT are incapable of solving a simple solution. Pathetic customer service.~~~,Troon~~~,2016-07-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Aghhhhhhh! Guess we'll be the 5% of population that gets left behind in this superfast roll out. We can't even complete an online shop. As for trying to watch catch up TV  iplayer or anything else on our 'smart' TV forget it. Not been able to connect to the Internet for more than a couple of minutes for a week now! They are 'looking into it'. Not recommended~~~,Rural Wales~~~,2016-07-15~~~,2,1,1,2
"Been paying £32 a month for 'BT Infinity 2' since it was available (so they claim) in my area / road. Never been able to achieve a download rate above 2megabytes per second. Speedcheckers on various websites showed I was getting 17.7mbps  now this is well below BT Infinity 1  let alone 2. Simply put  they sell you a product that doesn't exist. Their own technical team stated I should expect speeds of 20-30mbps. Where is the ""up to 76mb"" they advertise and sold me?~~~",Hampshire~~~,2016-07-14~~~,1,1,1,1
If i could give lower stars I would. This company and their customer service team are useless. I was contacted 5 times about the same issue from multiple people saying it was solved only to be told by the next the issue was not solved. They could not locate a line in my property despite them saying they had one. The company can barely walk and chew gum never mind handle services.~~~,London~~~,2016-07-14~~~,1,1,1,1
A word of advice to anyone thinking of using BT. Unless you really want it don't subscribe to BT Sport  even though it may be 'free'. HIf you decide to change supplier the don't automatically cancel the sports package. They send you a message stating that they'll switch you to full priced BT Sport lite at £13.50 a month  unless you ask to cancel it. This means you have no option but to contact them. When you ring you'll be put through to a customer service adviser who would make the hardest of 1980s double glazing salesmen blush. After 15 minutes of screaming at him to just cancel the sports package he then informs you that there is a 30 day cancellation clause for which you'll be charged the £13.50. What a con~~~,Bolton~~~,2016-07-13~~~,2,1,4,4
very very bad service ... bt are professional scammers ..customer service staff are not helpful at all ... have changed broadband service without informing me  put me to the highest tariff and had to pay 65 pounds for a month for phone and internet .~~~,FELTHAM~~~,2016-07-13~~~,1,1,1,1
First they told me several times there would be a half hour window between switching from sky to bt   2 days later they  are sending an engineer in 3 days 5 days total so far. The Asian call centre are 50% useless. I left BT 5 years ago for Sky. Sky's customer service is Rolls Royce and BT's is pushing a handcart uphill. I will complain to the regulator and I suggest everyone does the same.~~~,London NW5~~~,2016-07-13~~~,1,1,1,1
I wish I had found and read this site before placing my order with BT.  I currently have no broadband at home because my order is now one week late.  Every time BT email me with a new date (in words that suggest they are doing me a big favour!) it is a later date than the unacceptably late one they have already given. I cannot comment on the quality of their broadband as I have yet to experience it  although I am now expecting the worst. The customer service however cannot be described as terrible or appalling.  It cannot be described in that way because it simply does not exist.  Totally and utterly pathetic.~~~,Gloucestershire~~~,2016-07-13~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
If only I could award zero stars.  BT Internet cuts out several times a day everyday.   I have literally spent hours trying to sort it out with awful Indian call centres (they should rebrand as Indian Telecom as it would be more accurate). They have hung up on me  promised and booked callbacks which they fail to do  they also did not send introductory offer prepaid MasterCard for over six months  they promised to do this six times and then claimed I was not eligible.  I only received the MasterCard when I threatened legal action with small claims court.  They are a terrible repugnant company.  I was a sky customer previously and had zero problems with them over 4 years and wish I had not switched.  I will be changing as soon as my contract is finished.  Do not use BT.~~~,Northwood~~~,2016-07-13~~~,1,1,1,1
I consider myself a patient person  there have been many an occasion when I have had to be on hold on a phone call or not received the level of service required  but I always think to myself 'maybe the person on the other end of the line is having a bad day!' And so I just put it behind me and move on ... In BT Sports case  they are a pathetic and useless bunch!  Having tried to resolve a simple issue  BT Sports not working after paying for subscription  you would think after three horrendous  longwinded and incompetent phone calls  I still do not have BT Sport... And the incompetence far reaching  I am staggered to understand how there could possibly be so many layers of outrageous incompetence. That in itself  I have to admit is impressive. I mean credit to them that they can behave this way and still have a viable business.  In my last call (note not final  but last) the customer service assistant - 'customer service' being a figurative speech - they suggested the fault lies not with BT sport but rather our own TV. This was until I pointed to her this was the same TV that played TV sport a mile down the road only 4 weeks ago ahead of moving into our new house. She appeared perplexed  like a deer in headlights  at the prospect at having to veer from her scripted speech of blaming long suffering customer... I mean could it possibly be...BT sports fault???~~~,~~~,2016-07-12~~~,1,1,1,1

I don't usually leave reviews  but in this case I have to make an exception. BT have been appallingly awful. I ordered BT Infinity online on the 28th April  paid for a line rental saver and connection charge (£243.28) only for them to cancel the order 10 days later claiming I needed a new line (I don't). I was offered the same deal on the phone and they said they would waive the £130 charge for a new line (which they tell me at this point I need  but later tell me I don't) so reordered Infinity only for it to turn out to be considerably more expensive than they promised when the details came through  so I cancelled that in May. Since then I have had a bill for £34 taken from my account  and a final bill for £9- despite never having had telephone or internet from BT. I have made 8 phone calls to them- over 5 hours in total- and still have not had the 243.28 refunded nearly 3 months later  despite repeated promises to do so. BT you are awful  and I wouldn't even recommend your services to someone I didn't like. Beware.~~~,Worcestershire~~~,2016-07-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Moved house (to next door) No phone or broadband for 6 weeks now. No customer service. Delay management just manage to delay. Lies and excuses. Failure to communicate. Connection dates continually changed. Still receiving monthly bills. Need I go on.~~~,scotland~~~,2016-07-12~~~,1,1,1,2
BT  once a nationalised business  was privatised  sold its mobile business (surely the most stupid decision ever!) and has now made a bold leap into the world of glossy marketing and advertising  as well as a brave foray into the sports broadcasting arena. It has the underlying telecoms infrastructure  and is expanding the fibre broadband network  improving the speeds of many householders. All of the openreach engineers I have interacted with are helpful nice people  likewise the call operators. Its customer services leave a great deal to be desired. When I say customer services  I am not referring to the individuals who are on the end of the phone (who are friendly and professional)  but the underlying processes  and the design of their customer interface systems which are devious and designed to obfuscate. BT is far too aggressive in its wish to sell sell  sell. I would happily jump ship to another supplier  if I could. Sadly I have 9 months left to go. BT's website is designed as a glossy magazine style space for selling BT's 'products' rather than a broadband and TV supplier website oriented towards the customer. It's single aim seems to be to sell more 'products' as it calls them. You cannot cancel a service  you enter into another 'product'. It's very odd  and smacks of contractual requirements from which it is hard to extricate oneself. Nothing can be cancelled online  you must call the BT call centres  usually busy  and often in India  where you will get conflicting advice from the customer advisors. For example. I was told that I would be eligible for a partial refund for my poor performing broadband - I was paying £45 a month  including £18 for a phone line which I don't use  for 17MB connection  when in fact I was getting 6MB. I thought it reasonable to ask for a partial refund  and I was told that would be acceptable  once the problem was fixed. I was later told that I would not get any refund for a service which was poorly performing  only when it was non-existent  and that it would be up to me to demonstrate that the service was poorly performing.  There is no doubt that the underlying tone of a business comes over in all that it be. I find BT to be way too aggressive  and not remotely bothered about keeping its customers happy. We pay a lot of money  and we must ask ourselves  are we getting value for that money? I don't feel that I am. As soon as I have an alternative  I will be cancelling my contract ith BT and going elsewhere  and customer service will be my first priority. A company which treats its customers as a cash cow  to be exploited for maximum financial gain  does not deserve any of my hard earned  hard taxed money. Dear BT  try becoming customers of Virgin Media and see what 'customer services' is really all about. Piss off your customers  and as soon as they have an alternative  they will disappear. You have been riding your monopoly benefit for far too long  and you don't deserve your prized position~~~,Gloucester~~~,2016-07-11~~~,3,2,4,4
Been with BT nearly 2 years and I have to say what a big mistake I've done choosing this broadband provider as the services are extremely expensive and not worth a penny of what people pay..1 st thing they say that the broadband speed  is up to 76 - NOT The fastest I've seen was 7 MB/s which can be classified as fraud and telling lies to customers as its far away from 76 MB/s Another thing is that connection is never stable and I always keep getting disconnected  tried speaking with the fault team and they've sent me a new router and nothing changed  after trying to sort that out for months just gave up ... all in all very expensive   very unreliable and very disappointing... Wouldn't recommend to anyone~~~,Abingdon~~~,2016-07-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Had problems with signal from day 1 they tried to blame it on all sorts of things even though my previous provider had no problems . I had to buy a WI fi extender which helped but signal drops out all the time even though all different settings had been tried just gone back to sky and the problems are now sorted not cut out once bt has a bad hub bad service avoid the hype about the hub 5 being the best there is it's false advertising !!~~~,broughton~~~,2016-07-11~~~,1,1,3,1
I'm having problems week on week. Keep ringing BT they sometimes put the download speed up to a decent level then within a week it's back down to circa 0.06MB! Not fit for purpose! Last week I was told it would be up to 3MB and stay that way. What a fool I was to believe them! I'm trying to set up a business from home and need the internet but this is getting past a joke. I was on the phone for over an hour last week trying to get things put right. Bottom line is I'm being robbed: paying for a so called service that isn't there.~~~,isle of skye~~~,2016-07-10~~~,1,2,1,1
Your home hub 5 is a load of rubbish and so is your fiber service you can not connect to WiFi around your own home then you want to charge me £50 to replace it with an upgraded one or £250 to cancel my service what a disgusting service you provide you electrical good are unfit for purpose and should be recalled and a new upgraded one sent out free of charge (DO NOT USE BT RIP OFF COMPANY)~~~,Cornwall ~~~,2016-07-09~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

I was promised fibre optic within a month of joining if I left sky and have never got it despite hundreds of calls. Sky was better. I asked for 78 and get 1.7 or up to 2.0 if a lucky day. It drives kids and myself mad with buffering and slowness even on mobile phone!!  Bt call centres lied and I am in a contract until September paying £51 per month which includes phone line and am paying for useless Internet and useless service. Even the engineers come out and say it is useless but there is no space in the fubre box st the end of my road. Is there anyone who can guarantee me 100% around 78.00 fibre ???~~~,Milton Keynes ~~~,2016-07-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Very bad experience. They changed the price and I received an email saying that I don't need to pay antything if I would like to close the contract as the price changed. After a month I saw THAT THEY ARE TRYING TO STILL £251 from my bank account!!! I called and still now they did not risolve the problem and are trying to get some money. I really don't understand this brand and only now I realised why it's so difficult also to write an review like everybody does through google or social media.

"Now I don't usually do this  leave reviews  I mean but I desperately want to discuss my issues with bt even if it only helps one person refrain from signing up to the worst service provider ever; no I am not being theatrical. So it all started when I ordered my infinity 1 and entertainment plus tv package  now anyone who has read up on bt knows how expensive the services are  but hey you must pay good money for good services  but hey  I did my bit now I'm just waiting on bt to do theirs. At first they gave me the wrong hub so I got standard broadband instead of my infinity which in turn led to me not receiving my premiuim channels  sucks right? Well when I called up I was hung up on twice and then finally spoke to someone who seemed genuinely interested in sorting out my problem  or maybe it's just because we all know ""calls are recorded for quality purposes"" HAH what a joke that is I am actually in fits of giggles.. no  I lied  I most definitely am not. So anyway even though I didn't receive the correct services for the first month I paid my bill having faith that good old abdul or as you and I know him as 'Adam from bt' well you let me down didn't you Adam or abdul or whatever. And now my second payment has been taken and can you believe the cheek??! They've taken almost triple what my bill should be out of my bank.. I am still greaving over my hard earned cash. I mean I don't even have a landline so I can't be going over on my call package  I have unlimited broadband so it can't be that WHATEVER YOU DO  DO NOT GET BT SERVICES~~~",Sheffield~~~,2016-07-05~~~,1,1,1,1
This review is of a new connection and we are new customers to BT. BT's broadband checker suggests 2.34Mbs where as 3 other independent speed checking sites suggest 1.82Mbs  1.94Mbs and 2.04 Mbs. BT have failed 4 times to connect our Broadband  each time giving a definite date  assuring us that the connection has been fast tracked. On the 5th attempt after the engineers rejected the request for fast track  it was connected but a day later than promised. Customer support was appalling - both call centres based in UK and India were as bad as each other  BT's policy will not let you speak to a manager - who you get taking your call is the person that you will deal with  yet after each person assured us that they would personally check and email and call me to update - NONE of them have. A complaint was raised and the person dealing with the complaint said they would call me back at a specific time  it is now 4 days later and no call. Apologies if this is a rant but if this is what a company is like to NEW customers  i dread to think what it will be like once we are no longer regarded as NEW !!~~~,Angus~~~,2016-07-04~~~,1,1,1,3
Worst provider I have ever had  I would advise anyone thinking of joining BT to look elsewhere. Customer service is non existent  and you can rarely speak to anyone who understands or speaks English.The broadband speed is lucky to reach 1mb  stay well clear of BT~~~,Warminster~~~,2016-07-04~~~,1,1,1,1

Do yourself a favour and do not get bt broadband.  Our internet just cuts out multiple times a day; this dispite several engineer visuts and literally days trying to get throught to and speaking with indian customer services.
