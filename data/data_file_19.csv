THIEVESBT have been overcharging my granddad who has dementia and knows no better for a substandard copper broadband package. He's been getting charged over 100 pound a month for a package you can pick up for under 40 pound from themselves. Safe to say I have cancelled it and will never use BT as long as I live.~~~,uk~~~,2018-06-16~~~,1,1,1,1
After several calls to chase up a broadbabd fault on Sunday now being told they need to send me a new Hub and that could take 5 days! No reasoning with any of the advisers. Engineer came out this morning reported we needed new router but still hadn't been auctioned when I rang to chase up! In the middle of a house move can't action e mails or transfer monies do they care no they don't. Bet if I rang up as a new customer they'd use next day delivery to get my router to me . It appears that those of us who've been with them for many years get poorer service for our loyalty . Adviser told me once problem was fixed I 'wouldn't regret sticking with BT '. Yes what I'm moving house and there are plenty of other providers in the market place.~~~,Bradforf~~~,2018-06-14~~~,1,1,~~~,1
If you value your health then don't get into a contractual obligation with these guys. They will hang up on you if they don't like what you are complaining about  they will tell you they'll fix your broadband speed because you've been put on the wrong plan (a cheaper one of course) but they won't  they'll tell you that you'll get a rebate but you won't  they'll tell you they'll call you back but they won't. The most appalling service of all  you will get. They organisation is so chaotic that nobody knows what they're talking about are and everybody is just trying to blag it. One guy kept repeating that my speed is measured in Megabytes/s and another was making drawing comparisons between my 2 years old telephone filter and a 16 years old girl which is supposedly better than a 60 years old women (not sure in what sense)!~~~,MANCHESTER~~~,2018-06-14~~~,1,1,1,1
BT Infinity in Postcode MK44 2__ is not workable. The lines from the Cabinet are not only too long to provide Superfast Broadband  the copper is too thin. Can't even support 10Mbps Standard Broadband yet BT will tell you that between 10 and 19Mbps Download is achievable. The BT App asserts that their SpeedTester is the best at assessing line speeds and network capability. Does not compute. OFCOM are paper tigers.~~~,"Keysoe, Bedfordshire~~~",2018-06-14~~~,1,3,1,2
BT customer service is rubbish. I have been without email for almost 2 weeks  have spent hours on the phone over the past 10 days speaking to one call centre or another and been fobbed off each time. Just do what you promise - if you say you are going to resolve my problem and call me back at a specific time then do it! I still have no email after speaking to yet another ‘help’ line person this afternoon who told me there was a problem  I am aware of this but no one seems to know what the problem is or how or when it can be resolved. I am waiting in again for yet another call tomorrow which may or may not happen; if it does then I am pretty sure that my problem will not be resolved. I am paying for a service that I am not receiving and this is unacceptable- do not use them! I have put my email in so that I can submit this review but it is not working - ask BT why!~~~,Uxbridge~~~,2018-06-13~~~,1,1,3,4
Failed to install on the day  ended up with no landline  no broadband for 4 days. Only got it fixed after numerous calls and finally exploding - 15 mins later it works. I register a complaint and I start to get texts from Indian sounding names to my daughters BT mobile (she's 11) about the complaint. I reply to tell them not to use an underage girls number...they send another to that number. In the end I call them and spend an hour to get a miserly £20 back for forf the trouble and a total refusal to reduce a £59 connection fee i.e. it's fine that I should pay full for a botched service and any losses incurred as a result are my problem  they don't care. Also they have totally lost any record that I should have got reward vouchers so I should kiss goodbye to that part of the offer I signed on for. The customer service is shocking. If you want to listen to 'unfortunately' and other trained platitudes but a refusal to do anything  please give them a call. I only moved from Sky as they kept sneaking the price up and at one point even charged me for not having their TV service...so thought i'd try BT. All as bad as each other.~~~,Gloucestershire~~~,2018-06-12~~~,1,1,4,3
Crap service. My broadband Connection was  down for last 17 days and not fixed yet. Yesterday one of the service manager told me it will take another 30 days to be fixed. They want me to pay the bill for last month (for the service that I didn’t receive) I asked to end the contract   they transferred me to a lady from UK office   she threatened me saying if I wanna leave the contract I need to pay £150 + bill. After 1 hour argument I was transferred to a manager. She very simply told me “I don’t know when the network issue will be fixed  According to your contract if you wanna leave us before the contract ends you need to pay £150 if you fail   we will take legal action. Also  she said not to call them back again with the same issue which they been aware of  they will inform me once it’s fixed. There a few essential gadgets in my home need internet connection  ex (my mother’s medical equipment) I asked BT at least to provide me with a temporary dongle so my mother’s medical machines can work. The answer from BT was “sorry we can’t”. Don’t use this company or any of their services.~~~,East ham~~~,2018-06-10~~~,1,1,2,1
BT is absolutely terrible! We have not been with them any more than 5 months and in that time we have gone through 3 hubs   about 30 phone calls to get the WiFi back on and an under qualified idiot who decides to stick a giant cable through our wall which knocked the front of some of our bricks off!!!!!! I am a teen who has loads of school work to do and for most of it I need the internet  BUT GUESS WHAT....I DONT HAVE ANY INTERNET~~~,Preston~~~,2018-06-10~~~,1,1,1,1
An absolutely awful company to deal with. I changed to them for their TV and broadband package only after they offered to buy out the remainder of my contract with my existing provider. On swapping  I found out that I was tied in to a contract with my previous provider  so I decided not to go ahead but after informing them they offered to buy out the remainder of the contract and sent confirmation to me that they would do this... then once they had taken over the supply they refused to credit my account. They are not replying to any of my emails now and they won't provide a reference number that I can give to Ofcom to take this further  as they are required to do. I will try to get what I can back from Ofcom but if that doesn't work I will just reclaim six months payments back  which is the maximum I can under the Direct Debit guarantee and walk away. DO NOT TRUST BT!!! Utterly useless!~~~,Lincoln~~~,2018-06-09~~~,1,1,3,3
Ordered a change of address. Two months later and still they haven't moved it. I'm being forced to pay for a service that I cannot use because they are so completely incompetent when you speak to them. Spoken to over 10 advisors who have said a variety of excuses. They don't call you back or give any update. I've never had such a poor experience in my entire life.~~~,Bath~~~,2018-06-09~~~,1,1,1,1
I have had very poor service and have considered moving but reading the comments on here about other providers  it seems the whole industry needs dragging into this century. Have now decided to stay with BT for a while and make a damned nuisance to get my own back for the wasted time and aggravation they have caused me.~~~,Leicestershire ~~~,2018-06-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely disgraceful. After ringing up many of times about the internet speed and nothing being changed and being told it is fine. I decided to ring up yesterday with customer services putting the phone down after about 20 seconds. But I can say the internet is down more than it is on and would not recommend even if it was free!! Losing internet connection constantly. The worst broadband out there  really is disgusting. DO NOT RECOMMEND!!~~~,Stoke-on-Trent~~~,2018-06-07~~~,1,2,1,1
Honestly feels like a time machine. Reminds me of dial up internet but then again at least that was reliable. When you can’t even load a 2 minute video never mind a movie on Netflix. Honestly banging my head off the wall would be more helpful then the customer service  this is suppose to be the 21st century! The fact I can’t get higher than 10 mbps is a joke. Then again what do they care ! Not like they read the reviews !~~~,~~~,2018-06-07~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Do not use BT! They charge too much money for an awful service that constantly cuts out. We have been sent 3 replacement routers and NONE of them work. After 5 minutes of using the WiFi the hub decides to restart. Don't even get me started on the weakness of the hub. The speed is dreadful. I can't even stream a 720p HD video without it buffering every few seconds. The customer service is appalling. Don't even bother trying them. Save yourself heartbreak: go for ANY other provider.~~~,LONDON~~~,2018-06-06~~~,1,1,1,1

Couldn’t tell you about the reliability or speed as i have been sat at home for 2 and a half months without wifi. This is the second or third time we have been let down now . Told that an electrician is coming between 8-1:30 so we stayed in from work so that we could get wifi as my daughter has been complaining she has to go to starbucks to do her schooo work etc. Unacceptable no reason and no date for when they are coming just didnt turn up. I have spent about £100 in extra costs on data and starbucks in the last 2 months not ok.~~~,Lancashire ~~~,2018-06-05~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The week before I reported my issue with BT on the 21st of May I was experiencing slow internet  and constant dropping of internet. The internet was dropping out of connection constantly  and when connected was very slow. The dropping out meant that we could barely use the internet to do anything but browse internet at times. The internet was absolutely dreadful.     After we finally reported the issue I encountered the worse customer service I have ever experienced. I first used the online BT Live Chat where I had been talking to technicians about my issues  and how to solve them. The problem was  the technicians were constantly closing the chat and ending the conversation before I got anywhere. Eventually I get through to someone decent and have an engineer booked for the 22nd  which is great. But the engineer comes out and finds nothing wrong with the internet in the house  and tells us to ring up BT and tell them this. We report this to BT and they tell us they will have ‘higher-ups’ look at the problem to try sort it out  after waiting two days. They tell us when they are going to ring  but it is a time we cannot do. But we cannot rearrange the call because texting is going to charge us money. So  we try to be free around the time  but cannot get to the phone after they ring twice. And tell us they will ring the next day. This time we can be at the phone  so on the call  he tells us that the technicians are still looking into the problem. Eventually  they agree to send out another technician and on the 30th of May  from 1pm – 6pm. They completely just miss this appointment and do not inform us of why. We then get a ring the next day to rebook the appointment on the 2nd of June  the engineer then comes in and finds three different faults with the hardware in the home. Which I don’t know how the first engineer didn’t find.So  after this terrible experience for a service we are currently paying for £70 a month for  and it not being usable for more than half the month  BT ring up to discuss compensation and offer £14 for the fault and another £5 on top as a goodwill gesture. This is an absolute joke of a refund  after nearly 3 weeks of unusable internet and then horrendous customer services £20 is nothing.  We will certainly be looking to cancel our BT contract as soon as we can and would advise no-one else to get a contract with them.~~~,"Broadstairs, Kent.~~~",2018-06-04~~~,1,1,2,1

From day 1 of changing to BT business in May 2017 to current date. Is by far the worse provider I have EVER encountered. The customer service is incompetent. Rude  and after 12 months I am still having severe issues! Internet not set up on the date I was promised so had to work from cafes for two months. Then when it did work it was slow  kept flashing orange and dropping out. After several incompetent engineers  several different routers  Extremely rude customer service  never had a correct bill yet! Now they charging me incorrect bill for no internet! Complaints trying to fix the problem but apparently they can’t! So I’m left with no internet at all now! I work from home! Due to health reasons and I have lost business  stress levels have increased and I am still with no unlimited fibre which 12 months a go I was promised the best service ever with BT. I am about to lodge a complaint with ombudsman and starting the process to leave BT. I am anticipating nothing but issues even doing that!! I wish I had never gone to them!!! I thought I was getting a better deal with them!! But the experience has been the worse! If you are thinking of changing DONT go to BT! You will regret it and once they have signed you up! You get nothing they have promised! I am taking this further for misrepresentation. They get 0 for every aspect~~~,Surrey ~~~,2018-06-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Just learnt have been out of contract for 2 years and paying the standard fees and at not time being notifired of comming out of contract Complained and got a standard letter telling me the terms and conditions of the contract only Tried to negotiate a new package and the difference was £5.00 reduction from my original cost of the broadband and I had to keep my old hub which is 5 years old Caller seemed to think the cost compared with Plusnet was down to spead so if you have to wait a couple of seconds more for a £12 saving thats no problem plus some benifits including a price freeze over the term of the contract Surly if you are in contract thats the price you pay over the term of the contract obviously not as I was advised it can be put up with out warning Been with BT 35 years no point in being loyal~~~,Thundersley~~~,2018-06-02~~~,1,1,3,3

"Stay away from BT! They couldn't install it  when they ""did"" it cut out for hours & days at a time for the 2 months I suffered them & was slower than sky copper wire broadband. When I cancelled it because they weren't fixing it they want you to pay up the remainder of bill  for a service that doesn't work?! Worst company I've ever dealt with in every aspect. Begging you to all stay away. Please  I don't want anyone else to suffer the same stress. Go with sky cheapest broadband. Going on 5 years I've used them in total & never cuts out n cheap. Avoid BT  you have been warned. PS  non existent customer service  shockingly bad. U think they have SOME customer service  they have NONE! They lure u in & then ur on ur own.

Bt broadband is great  we have been promised fibre optics for 3 years  and still don’t have it   it goes at 0.3mbps  which sometimes goes upto 1mbps if we are lucky  it has only been down 3 times in the past 2 weeks and has been repaired twice  but still goes down each time after  we pay twice as much as people getting internet that is 200 times the speed. That is why I love BT broadband  thank you for taking the time to read how much I love it.~~~,Ditchling~~~,2018-05-30~~~,5,5,5,5

Really awful customer service from a company that seems incapable of ever getting it right.I ordered an iPhone  and they sent two. They seemed to think it appropriate for me to do the running around to sort out their mistake. As part of this transaction they convinced me to upgrade my broadband. I told them that they had made a right mess of the original installation and that if they were sure that they could do it properly  then OK. They made a right mess it with the excuse that a process had failed. For a technology and communications company they are laughable.~~~,Leicester ~~~,2018-05-29~~~,1,1,4,3
Switched from SKY to BT  WORST mistake ever.Same problems as other comments such as we need to send an engineer as the problem is at my end. That was just a week after installation. Changed back to SKY never had a problem since. They also charged me for canceling my contract early for something they could not supply. Very rude and useless customer service.~~~,Burntisland~~~,2018-05-29~~~,1,1,1,1

I switched from Sky to BT after 2 years of good service with Sky for what I thought was a better deal and had a 3 month nightmare as the connection failed every few days for 1 or more days and I spent hours on the phone while they tested the line only to conclude every time that there was a problem at my property and they would have to send an engineer out. When the engineer came he could find no problem  but more often than not the service resumed again and they said there was a problem at the exchange which they had just fixed. They sent me a new router after one call saying the problem was with that but it was not. Meantime when the service was working the download speed was always abysmal  which they said was because it was over the phone line and 3 miles from the exchange  but I countered that with Sky I had 2 years of good bandwidth as well as zero service interruption. After 3 months I got them to agree that the service was inadequate and I am currently exiting the 2 year £30 per month contract with them to go back to Sky  which will cost me £35 for broadband and TV. Interestingly BT are also playing a game in these contracts where they say 'up to' a certain speed but when the service is crap they say that contractually there is no minimum bandwidth agreement. They could have held me to contract on that basis but as it happened I also had the zero service days  which they couldn't duck out of. In my opinion you should avoid BT  and in my case it was only the hotspot nearby that kept me connected most of the time at all  though that service itself would come and go. Luckily I was not working from home otherwise it would have been very difficult and I would have spent a lot of money getting data through my mobile provider. BT? Never again thanks.~~~,Tarrant Rushton~~~,2018-05-21~~~,1,3,1,1
"Hi everyone  I signed up to BT fibre broadband in August 2017 in what otherwise seemed a smooth transfer which took just over 2 weeks to complete - a very good sign you'd say. Within two weeks after the service started  I started experiencing drops in connection every evening with router blinking amber  fluctuating connection speed and juddering video/gaming. So I reported my fault with BT helpline (which is based overseas  so often understanding them was an issue in itself) and the saga began. Instead of calling an engineer  BT kept resetting my router and sending me ""helpful tips"" how to make my broadband better - which worked for probably 30 mins  sometimes even less. Having called them for approximately 20 times (and each call was taking no less than 30 minutes)  I finally managed to convince the customer service representative to call the engineer - guess what  she never called one in  although it was promised. Later on  I was promised a wifi booster and a 15m cable to rectify the issues - they have never been sent to me. I was also promised that I will receive refund for these months when I had no quality connection. Finally  in the end Dec 2017  fed up with non-existent quality and constantly dropping connection I threatened to leave - at which point BT customer service managed to call the engineer in who came in around 7th of January and identified the problem with the BT exchange  after which the connection was okay  albeit not perfect. A couple of days ago I called BT and asked whether they refunded me for three months of no connection and my pain and time spent on the phone with them - I reckon about 25 hours by that time. In response  I was told that they could give me £10 as a goodwill gesture as they apparently cannot refund monthly fees past 120 days(!). Over past 10 years or so I've been a customer of O2  Sky and Plusnet  but at no point I had such a dreadful combination of poor connection  incompetent customer service and false promises. I will be taking this to the ombudsman to make sure this experience is heard and appropriate action is taken. My takeaway is - if you keen to spend hours of your precious time on the phone and get no result - sign up to BT broadband. Otherwise steer clear.~~~",Erith~~~,2018-05-21~~~,1,1,2,1

BT is the worst service provider I ever dealt with. I am paying for nothing  Although  I have a BT broadband at home  but I have to connect my PC to my phones network using personal Hotspot. I have been with them for more than two and half years  they not letting me to leave their rubbish service  they have a very bad customer services they do not care about their customer  they looks they know nothing about the service except that related to money. They over charge their customer without letting them know  they should understand people are not free to phone them up frequently asking foe explanations and reporting problems. last week I phoned them many times reporting problems and overcharging. They are a big lair  they told me that the engineer will come on Saturday to fix the problem  I was waiting him all the day  but he did not come  when I phoned them  they said he came on Friday and he fixed the problem  but actually I have not noticed any improvement  I gave them few weeks time  but it still as it was  when I asked them to resend the engineer they said they will charge 120 pounds.Eventually  I am still paying for nothing in addition to wasting my time and making me angry and depressed.~~~,Burton on Trent~~~,2018-05-15~~~,1,1,1,1
I had been with BT for 5+ years. Their service was alright as long as you paid them. When I tried leaving them they threatened me with a £400 fine. I pleaded with them saying that the only reason I am leaving them is because their Internet broadband is very slow in my new property after I moved house. They refused to listen. They constantly threaten over the phone. I have now opened a case with the ombudsman. I have learnt that it takes 8 weeks before Ombudsman opens a case against BT so I am patiently waiting without giving up. I have since moved to Virgin and their internet connection is so fast!

Absolutely terrible service. From what used to be a very reliable brand  this is now one of the worst. For the past 4 years I have had nothing but issues with BT broadband. Along with BT Sport my month bill is just shy of £70 per MONTH! With that I get a maximum speed of around 4mbs. That is a 10th of what it should be. I am constantly resetting the router.  Whenever I call(ed) BT I get a foreign call centre and have a lot of trouble understanding what they are saying. They take me through troubleshooting steps  which I know and memorised. When they get to the end of the steps they advise me about sending an engineer out at a cost of around £100 (if the fault is that of my own). I have since started a new broadband contract with Sky (who I know aren't the greatest - but surely cannot be worse?) I have managed to reduce my monthly combined bill of TV+Broadband by almost £50 per month. I am so fed up of BT. Overpriced  overhyped and just plain thieves.~~~,Dartf~~~,2018-05-15~~~,1,1,1,1
