I would give minus stars if I could!Worst customer service I have ever received!Charged me £90 a month. It was supposed to be an amazing deal for roughly £27 line rental and £7.99 for 10gb. There is no way I could've possibly gone over the usage by that much when I use my phone GB most of the time and I have a full time job away from home!!They're still charged me £90 a month for the last two months that I've unplugged the box and changed it with a Sky box. How could I have possibly used it then?!Apparently they're well within their rights to do this?!They're still charging my line rental when I'm paying it with Sky already it I have to pay a cancelation fee of another £90?! Do not go with BT. The customer service was terrible and so unhelpful. I spoke to 4-5 people in the space of 2 hours and apparently they couldn't give me a call back. So it cost me even more money to find out that I can do absolutely nothing and get absolutely no refund. They sounded so smug at the end of the conversation like they were about to burst out laughing! My friends and family are shocked and will be leaving BT once their contract terminates. I will pass this message to anyone and everyone that I possibly can. I am outraged. Thank you BT for 10 months of hell!! Another 2 to go!!~~~,Cheshire~~~,2015-12-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I don't trust them anymore they sign with me contract on different rate but every month they are charging more than that.Even I tried to discuss with them but they didn't listen to me.Don't recommend to anyone.~~~,London~~~,2015-12-15~~~,1,1,2,2
Waited from 8 am until 1.00 pm today at my sons house for a booked B T engineer to call to sort out his Broadband.If he wasnt there they would charge. They didnt turn up or call. On contacting B T was there an apology? No!! Son now has to wait to for weeks for these incompetent cowboys to try again. Couldnt organise the prov... in a brewery. And he is a new customer. First experience of B T And they are in the communication business - what a joke~~~,West Yorkshire~~~,2015-12-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have had BT BB for years and only recently changed to Infinity.  I live in a rural area miles from the exchange so I had thought the Infinity would not be much faster.  Set up was easy and it has made a vast difference when downloading  especially on my SKY box  but also updates on computer and such like.  BT Broadband has always been reliable for me even on the old HUB3 and the new HUB 5 likewise. Love the new fast Infinity.  Unlike other reviews I have always had good customer service from BT.~~~,Oxford~~~,2015-12-14~~~,5,5,5,5
If I could give not stars to BT I would  joined them very recently as I was moving into a new house. The customer service is an absolute farce  it is outsourced to India  where most staff members seem to speak very little English  which therefore means it takes a very long time just to explain the simple reason you're calling. Second to this I've had the call staff outright lie to me  and also provide me with information that is completely incorrect  so much so I've told them that and they've still assured me it is correct. They told me the engineer didn't need access to the property  yet he did and I wasn't there. They then refused to tell me when I could reschedule the appointment to. They moved my broadband activation date by over two weeks  and neglected to tell me  which is an outrage as I need the internet to work. All in all I have been utterly flabbergasted by how much of a farce the customer service of BT is  and that they have the audacity to call themselves British Telecom. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.~~~,England~~~,2015-12-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Mmy advise is stay clear!!  There are so many hidden costs  loop holes for them to CHANGE the offers and add CHARGES.  And the customer services are more interested in getting additional services from you than fixing the ones you have with them.~~~,"Devon, UK~~~",2015-12-14~~~,1,1,2,1
Couldn't be unhappier with BT. The speed is okay AT BEST but what we have cuts out every few minutes. Trying to go on phone apps is just impossible if they require an internet connection and online gaming is a thing of the past. If I could reliability an honest rating I'd go with -5 stars. I will be switching to any other service as soon as possible. I highly recommend someone else.~~~,~~~,2015-12-12~~~,~~~,2,2,~~~
3 months of awful offshore telephone support which resulted in a service that could not be used from day 1  and a £300 early cancellation fee.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS - If something goes wrong you will regret it.~~~,Bristol~~~,2015-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1
"I have been with BT (latest version) now (not by choice) for around 6 months. I have moved into a rural area of the country and half expected this. On moving from my last location I did what normal people do and asked around the various internet providers  had a few offers but decided to go with BT. I have previously been with Virgin (who I say were flawless) and i miss this level of service as BT haven't lived anywhere near to them. I need to go onto my 3G internet if I want to do anything fast. My internet cuts off ""most reliable ever~~~",Linton on Ouse~~~,2015-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1
You know what dial-up was quicker than this. and woe betide if your connection is lost  you will spend hours on the phone to someone who doesn't care. At one point they switched my landline number with someone else! I am leaving.~~~,Kingston~~~,2015-12-11~~~,1,1,1,1

BT & BT business has caused us lot of problems. They have most incompetent work force I have come across. For three and half years they charged twice amount they were supposed to charge us. BT has terminated our main number by mistake. They have put us on two broadband and two telephone lines. They were supposed to charge us one telephone line and one broadband. BT has terminated our broadband by mistake. They have accepted that it was BT's fault but they are not managing to rectify their mistake for twelve day. If care for your business or you need your services please avoid BT at any cost. I am happy to provide all reference number for my troubles.~~~,West Hampstead~~~,2015-12-09~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
After many years of problems with talk talk  contacted BT.  I was assured that I would have a better service from BT  including the ability to discuss problems with an operator in the U.K..  In practice  the broadband has just been off for another three days (the seventh time this year) and again I have had to waste time talking to operators overseas (in India) some are very difficult to understand and some very unhelpful (one would not even discuss the fault  just said that we needed a new filter  which she would order for us - that was months ago - no filter ever received).  I have tried to contact an bt rep. in England  who could probably resolve the problems - but this seems to be impossible.  BT CUSTOMER SERVICE IS VERY BAD  the only difference with Talk Talk is that their operators seem to be in several coutries  whereas BT are all in India!.~~~,Norfolk~~~,2015-12-08~~~,1,~~~,~~~,2
Have currently given 5 stars but only came on line today. Was with Orange / EE (from the days of Lineone) and for the last 3 / 4 years had problem after problem with them. Poor customer service  speed issues and more. Had a total of 5 routers sent to me  hung up on on numerous occasions and had an engineer out to the house. Finally after the last issue where the support desk simply did not understand what I was telling them put the phone down and immediately contacted BT to switch. From that moment on it's run like clockwork. The sales person right from the start advised me not to go for the top end as those speeds were not available in my area but infinity 1 between 28mps and 39mps were so I could have that at £10 per month as opposed to the 70mps plus deal at £30  result £20 saving already. Line rental already with BT  no change there. Went through all the details  bit long winded but they have to do it. He told me BT sport would be on my Sky that night  it was on before I came off the phone  change over day was the 8th  which it was and equipment would arrive a couple of days before  spot on again. I received paperwork and emails confirming everything including they were handling the switch from my current supplier  they were soon on the phone once that request hit them! Had an automatic call this morning telling me the broadband was up and running before I had a chance to swap over the equipment. Set it up  plugged it in and hey presto  all good. Speed good  box stable and wireless working faster than Orange ever did. Only glitch is email? To get access to the outgoing server you have to have at least 1 BT email account with a user name and password but that's not too sad. Hopefully it will continue like this or I will update my review.And no I don't work for or have anything to do with BT  if there had been any problems the review would have reflected that. Seeing that there was only negative reviews on thought I would share my positive experience~~~,Kent~~~,2015-12-08~~~,5,5,5,5
"5 months of sheer hell!losing connection every few minutes.Service centres try but fail to make any real difference.

No Stars!! It's rolling into day 12 and still no fix on our broadband. We have had a working service for around 50% of the time we have been paying for the services and the TV service is just as bad with the sports channels having never worked. I've spent over 6 hours on the phone. Without doubt the worst company I have ever had dealings with from a customer service perspective.~~~,London~~~,2015-12-07~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I've been with BT for longer than I can remember 6 or 7 years I think(since Pipex sold out). Upgraded over that time as new services came available - from regular broadband  to Infinity and now Infinity 2. I have never had a service outage and never had a router problem. YouView box for TV is another matter  but customer service was excellent when needed for that.Broadband speed has always been consistent and fast  with no noticeable slowdown at any time of day.I visited this site to check EE reviews as their packages are much cheaper than BT. EE reviews are dreadful and shocked to see BT don't fair much better. Maybe we only get our pens out when seriously miffed  and sit contentedly idle when all is well? As a very happy long term BT customer thought I should buck the trend!~~~,SW London~~~,2015-12-06~~~,5,5,4,5
I have moved house and BT couldn't any more the service i was paying for. I was advised that i can cancel the contract without any charges as it wasn't my fault that they can't provide the service any more but guess what. I have just found a charge of £304.87 for early termination!!!! NO BT AGAIN IN MY LIFE.~~~,London~~~,2015-12-05~~~,1,1,1,1
This is the worst provider that i have ever used. Internet fails on a daily basis  and they will do very little to try to put it right. wont release me from the contract but dont provide the service that i pay for. £363 cancellation fee if i want to leave.do not take a contract out with these idiots..~~~,Lancs~~~,2015-12-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Such a poor service. Did not revive any services that were booked in regards to moving our phone and Internet to our new property. All conversations were denied that an engineer was ever booked when I approached BT via phone call. So moved to another provider due to BT's in competence. Then two months later I've received a bill for a service that I've not even used. There is not even any person living in our new house so there's no possible way a bill could have been built up. Absolutely appalled and BT will not be recieveing a penny from me. Don't fall in to their trap!! You will get stung!!~~~,Shropshire~~~,2015-12-02~~~,1,1,1,1
I left Plus Net to move over to BT why someone please tell me.Any inkling of a problem with plus net was followed up immediately by a call centre in the UK. We went over to BT for the promised TV  promised faster line speed and promised sport. Still waiting for at least one promise but over two years later nothing. Saw the advertisement for fibre half price for the first year  so nothing ventured nothing gained and was told that is only for new customers if I wanted to upgrade the line rental and fibre would cost @ £50 a month. When you call with a problem it is put through to a call centre (eventually) in Asia has no-one informed BT management BT is short for BRITISH TELECOM. Was going to have a good rant but you have all beat me to it. STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~~~,Scotland~~~,2015-12-01~~~,1,1,1,1
I wish I had read these reviews before I switched to BT from Sky.I have not received any service at all  still waiting 8 days for broadband.

Terrible service throughout both with my home account and business unfortunalty due to rural location they seemed to have cornered the market and no other company can offer what i need. Total rubbish and as soon as lines are updated and we have an option who to be with it certainly will not be BT~~~,shropshire~~~,2015-11-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Stay away - unbelievably bad! We have been stuck with poor service  / reception for nearly twelve months. The router cuts out multiple times  a day so all connection is lost. This even applies at night when you might expect the service to be good. Numerous calls to helpline in India did nothing to help. Engineer could not improve performance. So fed up with the poor service we tried to opt out with just a month on the contract to go - but £98.90 cancelation fee to do this. You can't even just pay the last month whilst using another provider - they will still charge the cancelation fee. Avoid BT - you will regret it for the length of your contract.~~~,Plymouth~~~,2015-11-29~~~,1,1,1,1

THE most stressful set up you can possibly imagine. Beyond AWFUL set up service  Talktalk were angels in comparison to trying with BT. I paid for broadband  was told a date  hear nothing and there is no way of contacting them without spending an hour on hold after which you'll be sent to an overseas call centre. Had to call multiple times to ensure start then had the date postponed! Then received a letter saying credit control had tried to contact me (no they hadn't). Company is completely out of control  wish I'd read feedback and AVOIDED.~~~,Oxford~~~,2015-11-27~~~,1,1,1,1
No stars from me im afraid ive been waiting for over 3 months to get internet still no sign of that happening either none of the staff on the phone knew what they are doing and couldnt help only a reply of sorry we will have to call you back with some idea of what the problem is ! Charging a me over 130 quid to come out to the house ! Being charged stupid amount every month on my phone bill because ive been using data.Being a new mum i do not need all this stress. So yeah great service from BT youre doing a great job the lot of you !!!!~~~,Norfolk~~~,2015-11-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

"PLEASE BEWARE THE UNLIMITED ""UP TO  17mbps"" offer  either online or by phone. Very sharp practice indeed  fraudulent by omission maybe?  BT  it seems  are deliberately not telling us that to get anywhere near 17mbps (11mbps seemingly is now possible in our case) you more than likely need to ""upgrade"" to ""faster unlimited"" This is not offered by the sales staff or online! I guess most are aware most BT departments have a pretty poor reputation for customer service and also for many of us rural customers  terrible broadband speeds and poor reliability is the norm - we get 2.5 to 3.5mbps and it the line drops regularly.    You wouldn't believe the conversation with the upgrade personnel who don't seem to think that the sales team should give us that information when ordering and nor is not present as an available upgrade on the MY BT website either.  You need to dig very deep to discover anything about it (googling it is the best way) and even then there are no prices - you have to phone the self-righteous upgrade team. Local investment has paid for fibre to our local cabinet  (copper to the property) but we must pay BT an extra £13.50 per month plus connection fee (on top of the £7.50pm 12 month offer we're on) to achieve any faster speed. Full fibre and much faster speeds  if I was available to us would only be £5.00 more according to the current deals at BT.   If BT had told me that it would cost substantially more to get a half decent speed when our cabinet was upgraded shortly after I ordered  I would have signed up with another supplier.  It is currently possible to get the hybrid fibre/copper supply with a speed of 11mbps guaranteed for £10 per month. The upgrade lady proudly proclaimed that BT are not the cheapest - at least we got some truth there!!~~~",County Durham~~~,2015-11-24~~~,1,1,1,1
BT = Broken Telecoms.I've had similar experience of the BT service as a residential customer. Since moving to cable (Virgin) I've never looked back. I'm now once again experiencing the BT disaster on the company connection  if indeed connection is the right word. Intermittent issues going on for weeks. Seemingly with no resolution. Engineers contacting once in a while just to see if the problem has fixed itself  at least it feels that way. They really come across as clueless. Wouldn't recommend them unless you literally couldn't get hold of 2 tin cans and some soggy string.~~~,Camberley~~~,2015-11-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Very unreliable service; especially over the last 3 month. The broadband speeds over the last week have been very slow and my infinity broadband stopped working 2 days ago. Last month my phone stopped working for a week. Customer service is almost on existant. Overall opinion  don't use BT.~~~,London~~~,2015-11-22~~~,1,1,4,2
The worst experience with bt broadband ever.We ordered this broadband 10 months ago and its the worst broadband ever.I called them up about the problem and they kept me on the phone for more than 3 hours transferring me from one department to another and the end result was that they never ended up no where  they just kept taking me to different departments.The worst customer service ever.Most of the people are uneducated.I am planning to leave before the contract and I'm even going to pay for the charges. I also have bt infinity.So my advice to anybody thinking of ordering bt infinity  don't order it because the broadband is rubbish and the customer service is absolutely horrendous.~~~,london~~~,2015-11-21~~~,1,1,1,1
"Oh my God! This is the worst broadband ever.Firstly  we transfered from SKY to BT and this took BT over 2 months to fix and validate our transfer and process the order.Secondly  we you call  they keep transfering you to about 10 to 15 different people before someone eventually gets to listen to your problem.We have received more than 10 different dates for an engineer to come to install the broadband. Each time I called when an engineer failed to visit  the usual annoying response was ""sorry I couldn't see your order on our system"". I have had to RAISE MY VOICE on several occasions out of anger and frustration.Eventually when the broadband was installed  it had been one nightmare after another. The broadband is extremely very slow with download speed reading between 3 Mbps to 10 Mbps when it should really be over 70 Mbps.I have called several times with no success.BT braodband is a woe and total failure.It wouldn't take me many days now before I cancel my direct debits with them and move back to SKY or go with VIRGIN.~~~",London~~~,2015-11-21~~~,1,2,2,1
Summary of my BT experience: 1. They cancelled the engineer without telling me so I am left waiting for him at home like a mug having taken a day off work for it.2. They tried to deny that the engineer was booked in the first place then they denied it was a free offer on the 78MB/S fibre so they clearly don't know their online customer e-commerce experience.3. I was passed between 4 different advisors 5 or 6 times each claiming I needed to speak to someone else before someone finally decided to take responsibility.4. They offered a convoluted solution which involved me paying £130 for the engineer and then phoning them again to claim it should be free (unprofessional) wasting another day of my life and a potential dispute over the cost of the engineer.5. The presale broadband estimated speed was D/L 60M/Bs it is 50MB/s (hugely off and misleading). 2nd day into bedding in (you're supposed to allow 3) but I highly doubt it will go anywhere near 60. THIS and the free engineer socket replacement was THE reason I chose BT. My advice: Go with Sky if you possibly can over BT - their (BT) customer service is absolutely horrific and I hope I will never have to phone them again when the contract is up next year I will definitely be switching to someone else. Detailed experience: I wanted to go with Sky as I had heard only good things about their overall service and flexibility but apparently being the responsible suppliers they are  they did not have any more fibre deals available for my exchange as they keep the numbers reasonable to reduce the contention ratio and thereby provide a better service during peak times to the sum of their customers.  From the remaining suppliers I opted for BT despite the fact that I had received a number of warnings about BT broadband from friends and even my wife as well as reading reviews  but I never expected it to be this bad only two days into my service.  I ordered the service online on 06/11/2015 for my new home. This was for the 78/19MB/s fibre service including phone line.  In the ordering process I was presented with an option to book an engineer at no  extra cost (£50 for lesser deals) or self install the service.  I chose for the engineer to come around because it included him/her replacing the phone socket to a more suitable location. The phone line was activated on 09/11/2015The fibre was activated on 18/11/2015The engineer was booked for 20/11/2015 So here I am  taking a day off work  on the 20th sitting twiddling my thumbs waiting for the engineer to come.  At around 1pm I got a little concerned and checked up on my order online and noted that the engineer appointment had magically disappeared.  So I phoned BT and was fobbed off to one department after another and back again.  They claimed that the engineer was not necessary but then I explained that it was part of the deal that I bought so eventually after an hour or more on the line  they offer to send an engineer but to charge me £130 for it!!! They said that they will charge but then I phone them back and tell them that it was supposed to be free (not very professional at all) and to get the amount credited to my account.  I asked them to send an email to confirm that the conversation but the advisor refused and said she would put a note on my account for when I called.  I acquiesced to this and asked when the engineer would come and I was given a date of 1st of Dec which coupled with the ordeal of having to phone them again put me off completely and I told them to forget it and I would hire an engineer myself which I have done at a cost of £120.~~~,Sittingbourne~~~,2015-11-20~~~,1,1,2,3
Well after reading all the reviews I have now decided most definatly not going to sign up with them   I find it appalling that such a large company can't get it right !

Apart from the initial sales process the support is appalling. BT have changed my phone number 3 times  they blamed the initial change on Virgin (?) and they have never accounted for the other 2.I switched to BT from Sky last April. My main gripe is the dropping of the internet to my Windows 10 laptop  the MyView and the 2 Nexus we have. It think it might be a BT security problem as resetting the router fixes it  but is a pain. BT have replaced the router but this hasn't fixewd the problem. The technology is brilliant I get a consistent 37Mb download speed  the roaming WiFi service is good and has a lot of convenient access points. The new router fitted through the letterbox so I didn't have to callect in 48 hours later from the sorting office. If I had never had to talk to them I would think the system excellent. I switched from Sky who we inherited from O2. Sky had excellent customer service  I only moved away because of the cost for the new year after the intro  there roaming service is also very good but the coverage is less.If I can a deal I will go back to Sky.~~~,Midlands~~~,2015-11-18~~~,3,1,5,3
My change from standard broadband to infinity worked seamlessly. Hub delivered on time and upgrade occurred without me having to do anything or even be in. It's true I had to a MAKE a firm point about new customers being charged less but as a loyal customer I was given a very good deal. Other providers may be a bit cheaper but I'm not game to move given how well BT has always worked for me. I'm not sure they always give the same info when you ring up so you do have to be rather on the ball but if it ain't broke don't fix it. Very happy with BT~~~,South East UK~~~,2015-11-17~~~,4,4,4,5
BT are literally the worst company I have ever known  there customer service is discussing every single person I have spoken to must be the most incompetent people Iv ever had conversations with in my life. None of them communicate. They cancelled my account without telling me then took over 10 days to set up a new one so was 2 weeks without broadband or a telephone line in a terrible area for signal  after notifying them I had a new born baby and need a telephone line asap. I confirmed with one of the staff I was not paying the one off charge £35 set up few as their service was a disgrace  she discounted that and I paid my bill. They have now today decided to take £35 from my account for the set up fee that was agreed I didn't have to pay and they tell me it takes 3-4 days to look into the phone calls which will prove I'm right and then will take up to 10 days to get my money back. They are an absolute disgrace I would be embarrassed to work for the company DO NOT USE THEm UNLESS U HAVE TO unfortunately I'm in a new build and we have to use BT.~~~,Borough green ~~~,2015-11-17~~~,~~~,~~~,3,~~~
I just moved and signed up for BT including their BT TV youview package.  Broadband fine  but in order to use the TV package you need an aerial  not a dish.
