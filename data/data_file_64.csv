The most appalling customer service I have ever experienced. BT disconnected my broadband by mistake and for a week now I have been going around in circles trying to establish what the cause is and having to explain myself at least 4 times on a single call being transferred across different departments. Raised a complaint which was not registered initially  so I had to ask the staff to register my complaint  which has not been taken seriously  because it has been a week since then With no update. If customer reviews make any difference to the customer experience by taking customer feedback on board  then please sort this out and make sure it doesn't happen again.~~~,Cardiff ~~~,2015-06-26~~~,~~~,1,1,1
Shocking service from start to finish. From getting my account set up and then corrected 5 times due to incompetent staff  being billed incorrectly numerous times and then to find that the actual amazing new Broadband BT advertise as their best ever is woeful at best. Constantly losing connection and working from home it is really annoying I can assure you! Avoid! Use pen and paper  it is more reliable and probably faster!~~~,Manchester~~~,2015-06-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolute rubbish. Changed from talk talk to bt last year signed up for totally unlimited only to find it wasn't unlimited and I went over my usage and was charged. Changed my package to totally unlimited with unlimited everything at a cost of I think it was 40 quid only to find it increasing every month I have just paid 58 quid! Don't have a clue why it is going up every month cannot log into my account to see what is going on. Also was given a different phone number which I wasn't told about so couldn't understand why no one could get hold of us I had to ring my phone from my mobile to get the new number which I did not want. Rang BT numerously and eventually got my number back after about a month. Not happy will not be renewing my contract.~~~,Dorset~~~,2015-06-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Very slow speeds at times  customer service very difficult to deal with and after several months of trying unable to resolve my issues. Will not be using ever again!!~~~,Lancashire~~~,2015-06-23~~~,1,1,2,1
We are promised up to only 7.5mb/sec.and in fact achieved that regularly up to about 12 months ago.Now we struggle to get 1-2 mb./sec. and BT won't fix it....they keep coming back with the explanation that it's because we have 8 applications....we only ever have 2 running on wireless broadband and we had these before when the speed was ok.I want to change but as the line is provided by BT I'm unsure whether it'll make any difference except maybe for a lower cost which is not what I need.Ideas??~~~,"Winsford,Somerset~~~",2015-06-23~~~,1,2,1,1
Awful. £130 for new line.Engineer didn't do his job  gave incorrect information  couldn't get a another appointment for over a week (which i received no confirmation for)  then well over 40 mins on hold to sort it out (I'm still holding). You simply cant believe what they say - I was told two different versions of why work couldn't be completed. To make it worse this is just one in a line of errors over last 6 months - constantly re-setting the wi-fi  poor ordering online  long waits on the phones and variable (being polite) customer service on the phones. DO NOT GO WITH BT.~~~,London~~~,2015-06-22~~~,1,1,1,1
Had no broadband for a week-BT seems totally ineffective in dealing with fixing it.Waiting for someone from Mumbai to ring.Cannot contact a BT person in  uk. Have now contacted MP to see if he can help.Have to go to localpb and read emails there and run business Customer care of BT a total shambles.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2015-06-22~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
ordered broadband /TV  29th May for activation 4th June received text to say it was cancelled no explanation and I would be contacted in 2 days which they did  apologised and was told it would be activated 16th June and all activation  delivery fees would be scrapped.my package included extra 20 channels ie: fox gold etc  another text informed me I would contacted 18th June 2 days after due activation date  cancelled again . I contacted BT and after being sent everywhere finally spoke to a agent in UK i explained what was happening and he said he could reorder again but now I would have to pay activation charges and £10month for extra channels but I said that was not what I was offered and was told if I took the package he would add a complaint and all calls would be checked and if they proved the agent did offer me these they would refund the charges I refused this and now waiting for another call 22nd June ...not going to hold my breath~~~,West sussex~~~,2015-06-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful! The wifi is so inconsistent and I have no connection even from my bedroom. Customer service is appalling  there are inconsiderate and rude. Keep losing connection and it takes about 10 minutes for a page to load. Don't choose BT whatever you do.~~~,London ~~~,2015-06-21~~~,1,2,1,1
BT Broadband service is appalling!  Emails going missing.  Losing totally  inbox  outbox  all saved emails.  Have needed to contact them for the past 3weeks.  Today  again  emails disappearing into the ether.  It takes minutes to sign in/out  Change to another email address  etc. So disappointed with the very poor broadband service.  Since it combined with Yahoo it has been nothing but trouble.  Ive been told that BT are slowly severing their customers from Yahoo but it could take months!  Not acceptable BT.  Should really change to another provider and that would kick BT up the bum.  This is the 4th week and this morning it's so slow I need to wait for the service to keep up with my typing.  Poor show BT you should be ashamed.~~~,Cambridge~~~,2015-06-21~~~,1,2,1,1
Broadband service reliable but much slower than advertised at my address. Customer service very poor  polite perhaps but staffed mostly by people who can do no more than read scripts. Much of the response is telephone only  i.e. no audit trail of the poor service  and if you're stuck with Yahoo mail  you may have to change your password twice a day through no fault of your own  and BT say it's not their product so tough luck.~~~,Hampshire~~~,2015-06-20~~~,3,1,3,4
Very patchy customer service.  If you fall into the right category  it's not too bad  but if it's a bit complicated  then you've got no chance.  For a communications company they're very difficult to get in touch with.~~~,Ardrossan~~~,2015-06-19~~~,3,1,2,3
Quite frankly useless in every way  shocking customer service  shocking reliability  even leaving these clowns is fraught with hassle. Probably the worst broadband provider in the universe~~~,Newcastle~~~,2015-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1
HORRID!!!!! NEVER EVER JOIN THEM!!!  They messed up my initial order  made me wait 11 days for a connection  connected me on the wrong rate  charged me an activation fee when they promised not to  sent me a bill for £76 pounds when it was supposed to be around £36  promised me call backs when I called to find out what is happening  wasted my time for three weeks then when I wanted to cancel my account they said I owed them money when I was only connected for five days on the wrong rate and it was all their fault!~~~,London~~~,2015-06-18~~~,1,1,4,3
Shocking  made the fateful mistake in moving from Talk Talk to BT. They took the order but placed my order on pending so was not actioned on  only found out when I moved to BT. They issued me with the infinity box but the speed I have at the moment is barely recognisable on a speed test  its that slow. I thought it would be a seamless service from 1 provider to another but this is simply not the case but this is down to BT. Wish I could turn the clock back. Not impressed with BT at all.~~~,Durham~~~,2015-06-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Changed to BT A Month ago.Afterbeing with BE THERE FOR 3 YEARS+ SKY Took them over  We were getting 18/19Mb minimum & ocasionally 21Mb 16msec. ping Upload was 1.22Mb.This account was in my wifes name Which became a problem when SKY tried to charge extra for NOT being a SKY TV or Phone package customer my Son was but once set up said it was not possible to combine the 2 accounts  even after thretening to cancel the TV Package. they did relent & dropped the b/band to £5 per month for a year.Because of there dictatorial attitude & service dropout at random. She Canseled at year end.I then moved to BT knowing what my line speed was capeable of I was confident to get the same or near  speed after 5 weeks of complaining my best speed is 12Mb download & at worst 0.18Mb on an evening  this lowest has improved after all my complaints  I am still very dissatisfied & still wanting what We got 4 years ago down the same phone line. They do not seem to care I have been a BT customer for more than 50 years.~~~,"Hebden road, Haworth ~~~",2015-06-17~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Dreadful... Took BT Sport full of excitement but hardly been able to watch anything in HD as  firstly it kept freezing and then stopped working all together. They could not solve the problem after many times trying. I then get charged £34 to cancel something I can't even use. AVOID..!~~~,Walton On Thames~~~,2015-06-17~~~,1,2,1,1
BT is the worst. I live in Canary wharf in London and yet it takes BT 6 days to bring internet back  which is absolutely unacceptable in year 2015~~~,London~~~,2015-06-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely shocking  terrible customer service  terrible broadband speed  not reliable at all. We didn't have proper service for 6 months and bt is just not interested.~~~,Reading~~~,2015-06-17~~~,1,1,1,1
upgraded today from standard broadband to BT you view with a new hub.I now have no internet  no tv and no back up from these idiots. How bt can be allowed to keep trading is beyond me.  Every dealing I have had over the years has been appalling. scum of the earth~~~,southend on sea~~~,2015-06-16~~~,1,1,1,1
awful broadband I can load google  techncial cant fix the interference and BT would let you cancel. Hours being passed around hte world requoting my phone number and address  while paying for nothing~~~,london~~~,2015-06-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Ordered bt infinity to coincide with house move  bt promised it would be there for the date of our move  only guess what it wasn't.  After many phone calls where the date slipped back and back we were told we had cancelled the engineer  where in reality bt had told us we didn't need an engineer.  Then after 4 days of calling they told us we had been speaking to the wrong department.  The date for installation is now about a month later than they originally said - don't think I believe them.  I am horrified by the way we have been spoken to and the complete failure of bt to deliver on any promise - everytime they said they would call back they didn't.  Oh and by the way they have billed us and taken the money from our account from the date of our house removal.  Why after 15 years of avoiding bt did I ever consider using them again - worse decision I have made for a long time.~~~,Doncaster~~~,2015-06-15~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
advised to upgrade to infinity from basic broadband to get a better speed my system is now slower than before so slow now that my pc is unusable for days at a time keep complaining but get nowhere with bt accept speak to some very nice people in india my advice is steer clear of bt infinity.~~~,herts~~~,2015-06-15~~~,1,2,1,1
I can't actually rate any of BT they are the biggest pile of dung i have ever come across. I'm talking years of experience. Don't bother with any of their products. The staff in India are robots and unable to deviate from their scripts. Doesn't matter how much you complain they never ever deliver what they say they are going to and then offer £5 compensation.... that is when asked they never actually offer!I can't believe in this day and age they are allowed to get away with such horrendous conduct  and they are not cheap either. Broadband doesn't work and still being charged for BT Sky 9mnths later when it could never be installed as the broadband speed is so poor won't support it. Have rung BT 5 times for a refund and they still can't sort it. Promises of manager to ring back....can never speak with one god for bid  and guess what manger never does. I've had it with them now and will be going right to the top to complain. What ever you do don't go with BT.~~~,Osborne~~~,2015-06-14~~~,~~~,~~~,1,~~~
I have had intermittent difficulties following a horrendous set up experience of multiple no shows from BT. Most recently an excellent engineer came out and appeared to resolve the ongoing problem. However when trying to seek compensation from them for a long term problem albeit intermittent but really been unable to access on demand consistently without buffering since October 2014. Now all appears well. I have contacted billing and have experienced the usual run around  lies about returning calls  false details recorded on the system and the last contact stated I am not likely to get any compensation because I have not complained enough and are soon to be out of contract. I have infinity  Broadband  TV. If any one from BT Senior Management is reading this please contact me as your operatives clearly lie consistently and are malicious. All I want is a good service - oh on reading the engineers notes - he did not know I did - his instructions were 'customer must prove fault'. well the fault was not mine and proved to be BTs. Mmmm what a premise to start off from. Really disgusted.~~~,Nottinghamshire~~~,2015-06-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Sick to the back teeth of BT and their NOT Super Fast Infinity and NOT reliable  after 5 months of trying to get this resolved I have lost the will to live.  New Ofcom rule  I believe  means I can opt out without penalty~~~,~~~,2015-06-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Home hub 5 issues for 5 months now. No usable wifi. BT service apalling  In over 20 phones calls not once have I spoken to  UK call centre despite asking in every call to speak with a UK manager. Have been lied to multiple times.~~~,Gloucester~~~,2015-06-14~~~,1,1,2,2
The worst isp ever! I regularly have huge problems connecting. Download speed is appalling. Customer service really don't care about your problems. When your due an upgrade you have to fight tooth and nail for them to even give you one. I had to threaten to leave my contract before they would even listen to me. And to top it all off they have blocked websites so the freedom of browsing is lost with BT  absolutely useless as soon as my contract is over I'm defiantly leaving. I'd get a better deal using a wet fish!~~~,Bolton~~~,2015-06-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Utter rubbish.  Made the mistake of signing  up to BT infinity. The only thing infinite about this service is the length of time you have to wait for the page to load or my iPad to sense the weak signal.  Dial up was faster.  Looking for a new service provider. BT can keep it.~~~,derby~~~,2015-06-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Had to use bt for broadband when moving house because others could not move my phone number. Then paid full price for 12 months for 0.7 mbit/ sec broadband when it worked at all. Then I called them and signed up for 12 month contract for slow dsl at a discounted rate. The same week they announced that fibre was finally available.They are willing to sign me up for new fibre contract but I pay the full rate which is twice the discounted rate because I am not a new customer. Bt discust me. They are still a monopoly and behave like one. Of course other companies also do not want to keep existing customers  but I am complaining about bt right now.~~~,LEICESTERSHIRE~~~,2015-06-11~~~,1,1,1,2
AVOID! Most useless  unreliable company I have ever come across! My BT infinity was installed over 6 months ago  2 engineer call outs and numerous phone calls later it's still not working properly! They offered me a £100 cash back as a gesture of good will! Even though I've paid over £45 a month for the past 6 months!! They have made my blood boil! USELESS~~~,Pembrokeshire~~~,2015-06-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Good Speed. INCREDIBLY TERRIBLE RELIABILITY  appalling customer service.~~~,Droitwich Spa~~~,2015-06-10~~~,1,1,4,1
It is a matter of fact that BT is the worst company in the UK. They do not provide anything close to a good service. When you have a problem they will lie and lie for weeks until they fix it. Customer service people are morons who don't right down any information you give them so you end up repeating yourself a thousand times in the space of 2 days and for all this pleasure you pay more than most other broadband companies around. Only reason BT is still around is because they gain all their money from line rentals. Without this they would have gone bust a long time ago.~~~,Adam~~~,2015-06-09~~~,1,1,3,1
What a rude disgusting company but really are. Cut off the phone 7 times. Broadband that has the slowest speed and after moving from Virgin due to a new build property not being able to get Virgin I'm at my wits end with bt. After many phone calls to bt I have been no option but writer this review as full confirmation I've now cancelled my service .an utterly disgusting e periwnce and one I do not wish participate again. I've exhausted every avenue and now but are trying to charge for cancelling our contract when the services are not fully working. Bt now have thus blamed the new build property for the slow speed.~~~,Leeds~~~,2015-06-09~~~,1,1,1,1

Terrible service - do not recommend.  If you are also having or have had issues contact Watchdog.  The more people that do  the more likely we can get their appalling service brought into the limelight. Day 7 and still no broadband and still no date for reconnection. Once again i am left with extra fuel costs and childcare costs by needing to work from the office. No call from BT  had to chase them - 2 emails not responded to and a phonecall. Managed eventually to speak to the 'bored' sounding executive customer support person  and told they will call me tomorrow when they have more information.  Update 5th June - day 4 with no business broadband - called back from customer services  the same issue persists  the engineers have not closed their part so the new order cannot be raised. But I'm assured it has now been escalated to the responsible team...only took 4 days to decide to do this! And 'hopefully' it will be closed today  so that the new order can go through on Monday and 'hopefully' some time next week I will receive the internet service (although they cannot promise) that mine and my partners business desperately need back again. Needless to say after this weeks saga I am not holding my breath. Please anyone about to write a poor review - share also with WATCHDOG. In the hope that getting BT to review their full processes rather than trying to fix individual issues will provide future customers with a better service. Update 4th June - can it get any worse? Seems it can! After cancelling my broadband in error  and still on day 3 having made no progress to reorder. It (remember I'm supposedly on an enhanced business service)  has just become worse when I came in from work to a bill for over £500 they are going to debit from my account in a few days. It appears this is payment for my unused contract liability seeing as my account has been cancelled WHICH I DID NOT REQUEST! So now I'm expected to pay hundreds for their error and I STILL HAVE NO BROADBAND and currently no hope! PS  BT man I spoke to about invoice said he'd seen a lot of these 'changovers' going wrong  and account closures that shouldn't happen! June 2nd - My company provided my work line and internet through BT  and following a company change asked employees to arrange their own providers and we would be subsequently subsidised. Let's keep this simple I thought  let's remain with BT  and just ask for everything to be switched to my name. WRONG choice! I was passed from department to department none of which seemed to know how I could switch to my name - passed from business to residential (times that by 3 or 4). Eventually I ffound someone who seemed to know  convinced me a business account would be better and she would arrange it all  including an upgrade to infinity. Long story short  upgrade hasn't happened  broadband has been cut off despite a call to them after I received a letter warning it would be cut off  and their subsequent reassurance this wouldn't happen  and now evidentally I need to wait 2 to 5 days to be reconnected. I am livid right now  and I'm unable to work. Assoon as I'm back online will be looking at how I can cancel my BT contract due to the POOR service. The only positive is my phone still works  although they managed to get a bill out to me  including 28 pound to move the account to my name and 4 pound payment charge whatever that is  sounds like they are charging me to bill me!! Really in 2015  can companies still remain this bad  with one department not knowing what the next is doing? And all this on a supposedly enhanced business service  I pity anyone on residential! Anyone considering BT  please rethink.~~~,Bedfordshire~~~,2015-06-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Bill a day late=pestering calls through the night. Broadband speed not as it should be. Drops out often. Complaints with BT only compensated if you stay with them  if not nothing. Staff in general unhelpful and sometimes rude to the paying customer. Hard to understand the Indian accents  avoid this company if you like quality~~~,Chislehurst~~~,2015-06-08~~~,1,1,2,1
It took BT three months and one day to connect my BB. Offered me £9 in compensation. Operate like a garden shed business and wash hands of you even when it's their serial incompetence at fault. Now taking them to court.~~~,Co. Down~~~,2015-06-06~~~,1,1,2,3
i have to say i am disgusted with the service i received. i decided to change from Virgin back to BT and placed an order for a new BT package on the 12th of April. this package induced BT entertainment  BT sport a HD package and an extra box for my daughters room. the BT engineer came a week later and firstly only installed the main box. according to him there was no record of the extra box. furthermore i had none of the extra channels i ordered. i let this pass however because he explained to me that it could take 24 hours for the channels to come down. i have waited 6 days and i still do not have any extra channels i ordered. it isn't simple the fact that i don't have the channels but the way it has been handled is utterly appalling. i phoned BT and explained my situation and was told that my order had been cancelled    eventually i was told it was a technical error that had deleted my orders  so me begin me thought well cant you just get them back. but no i have been going round and round in circles for days now being passed from person to person  getting hung up on. i was told that i would have everything by the 3rd of June.... it is now the 5th and i still have nothing. i am sick and tired of constantly explaining myself to people i just want the channels that i will be paying for. furthermore the intensive to get BT was a £150 Sainsburys voucher which i fear i will not get.~~~,England~~~,2015-06-05~~~,1,~~~,1,~~~
Things were going okay until we tried to move house and take BT Infinity with us. Placed the order then they cancelled it with no reason given. Been trying to get it reconnected for a week and counting each day staff spin some story of it will be connected tonight and of course nothing happens. They make it as hard as possible to complain and never keep a record of what you've already said so each time you have to repeat yourself.~~~,Maidenhead~~~,2015-06-05~~~,2,1,2,2
