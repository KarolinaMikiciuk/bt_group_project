Can't fault the service.  Was due initially to have the broadband connect 4 weeks after purchase however after the first visit in week one Open Reach could not locate the 'in' to my property and decided that some ground work would need to be done (digging up a bit of path).  This pushed my go live date back by a further 4 weeks which would leave me without a connection for 4 weeks as I'd terminated my contract with Virgin.  Spoke with BT who immediately dispatched a 4G router to cover the down time.  Following week Open Reach dug up the path and did the necessary ground work - spoke with BT again who then brought forward my go live date to the original agreed date.  Excellent service all round.~~~,Bristol~~~,2021-06-07~~~,5,5,3,5
On moving to BT  my elderly  hard-of-hearing grandparent intended to retain our phone number  but this did not happen (whether through misunderstanding or miscommunication). We were only made aware of this months later when our original number was deprecated by our previous provider  and we contacted BT to inquire what was happening. We're now outside of the period BT would allow us to reclaim our original number. The problem is that BT did NOT notify us of the change of phone number. Had they done so  we would have been able to promptly rectify whatever issue led to not retaining our original number  and we would have been able to reclaim our original number within the allowed time period. The agents I've spoken to have been nothing but helpful  I cannot fault them and I understand there's nothing further they can do to help  but the failings of BT's processes have resulted in an easily avoidable issue and inconvenienced my elderly grandparent.~~~,North Tyneside~~~,2021-06-07~~~,2,2,4,4
WHAT AN AWFUL AWFUL SERVICE. A BT engineer came to our house a week ago to set up the internet and left without connecting us for some line problem. He gave us no idea on when it would be resolved. Endless calls with BT to organise for another engineer to come today and they didn't show up. I thought it was an essential service what they provide????~~~,AL5~~~,2021-06-07~~~,1,1,1,1
I'm absolutely disgusted with BT. My mother whos in her 80s switched from EE to BT in what she was told would be a straightforward process taking a couple of weeks. 3 months on and she still hasn't got broadband. This is despite 7 visits from a number of incompetent workmen who in most cases did not have the skill or equiptment to complete the work the came to do. BT are still charging her and it's taking over 45mins to reach BT to complain. BTs fraudulent abuse is nothing short of criminal.~~~,Chelmsford~~~,2021-06-03~~~,1,1,1,1

They are the worst company i have ever had to deal with. Dont let their PR fool you  their systems seem designed to draw your custom and then take whatever they can with subversive distracting and downright dishonest practice. I am now onto my seventh account number. They even repeatedly rebuffed my request to escalate my complaint and instead advised me on what OFCOM would conclude. I am outraged and remain so since i first engaged with them in November 2020. I am patient and diligent  20 hours of phone calls failed to resolve it.~~~,Northumberland ~~~,2021-05-28~~~,1,1,1,1
BT don’t deserve any stars but I couldn’t write this review without putting one.   Around 2 months ago I called them 3 times as my hub kept timing out.  As it was 11 years old I was told I would need a new one so a text was sent telling me my hub had been dispatched.  It didn’t arrive so I went through this process 3 times after which they admitted they had never really sent my hubs!!!! I was passed from pillar to post and ended up with a man who told me I was on an old service and could get a much better one for half price which would have been 25.00 for the phone and broadband.  I agreed to be passed to the person who could set this up for me.  He told me the service would be 67.00 and that I would need to pay 9.00 for the delivery of a new hub when it had previously been free.   I couldn’t believe the right hand doesn’t know what the left hand is doing and they weren’t even prepared to send me the hub free of charge for previous poor service.  Needless to say I’ve left them and am with Vodafone now.  They are charging me 30.00 and I have a better service.   When I cancelled I was advised by what I think is the retention team to either send the old hub back or bin it as it was 11 years old  didn’t work and was therefore no good.  Well I binned it and today I got an envelope with a bag to return the hub in and an email telling me to return it or I would be charged 43.00.   I rang and complained telling the man on the phone I had put the old hub in the bin as advised by them and he said  ‘well you’ll just have to pay 43.00 then I didn’t advise you.’  I challenged this telling him he represents BT.  I then asked to speak to a manager but was denied this until he had found my account.  He was very sarcastic and he asked me how much I paid and what date my last payment was.  My bill differed each month so I gave an average and as I couldn’t give the exact date of my last payment he happily told me I couldn’t speak to a a manager.  They had always dealt with me before.  There are other questions they can ask. What’s sad is I am 56 years old and have been a BT customer all my adult life.  Their service used to be brilliant which is what kept me all these years.  Ive never known a company’s service to go down so much.~~~,Northampton~~~,2021-05-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
New customer  1st 14 days brilliant but now dropping all the time  coming back when I call them which I have to do everyday.Why are they advertising if their current systems cannot cope with current flow?Surprisingly I was told by their customer services its my fault because I use alexa yes  so with BT one cannot use WiFi devices! Actually cannot use email  internet  ...No services but still cashing the money.All congested yet they still chose to float their cables in trees  wind and rain... oh dear it is still extremely slow when dry and sunnyIt is so obvious ombudsmen not doing their work!~~~,Chelmsford~~~,2021-05-27~~~,1,1,1,1

Everyone I have spoke to on the phone either passes me to another colleague or a different department! I wouldn’t recommended this company at all.

"We were due to have services installed at the property  with the only appointment window options being 8-1 or 1-6pm.  Incredibly inconvenient with school dropoff/pickup  but can't be helped so we made many arrangements to accommodate.  They bombarded me with emails and texts telling me to make sure I was in.  And on the morning giving the name of the engineer and his mobile number.  But nothing happened.  No-one turned up  no-one answered my texts or calls.  And then when I spent almost an hour on the phone I was told ""it might have been a resources or time issue""  and once the engineer submitted his notes that evening they would come back to me to arrange a new appointment.  They did not.  I then spent over an hour on the phone  through a range of departments and 4 different people  with one gem being ""we don't want to keep passing you around on hold  that would be a bit of a wind-up""... and then proceeding to put me onto some different kind of caller queue that I never came off.  Utterly unbelievable - the most atrocious organisation of services I have ever experienced  with what apparently was an approach of palming me off on hold/new caller queues as they couldn't/wouldn't deal with the problem themselves (call-time targets to hit??).  I am completely understanding of operators trying to do their best job.  But clearly the policies and systems in place with BT customer service are dysfunctional.~~~",Birmingham~~~,2021-05-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Speeds were no problem but signal to my sky meant i could not watch Disney and there advive was to drill through my wall into the cupboard where there box was and put up a shelf in my living room so there box could be closer.. eh no.. even though there box is only 5 foot away from the sky box behind a plasterboard wall. Also signal to phones would drop out too  then they said too many devices must be the issue.. 1 sky box 2 phones and 1 tablet  so i changed to sky internet and all these problems are now solved and have never returned.~~~,Bathgate~~~,2021-05-08~~~,2,2,5,1
I had BT for many years. It used to be the best service  in the past 5 years it declined a lot  only the price didn't. The fiber managed to be worse than normal! The instability for a central London area was insane. I was also charged for something I did not own and when i tried to dispute they reported and made it default after only a couple of months in my credit report. They blackmailed me to pay even more extra fees to have my default removed and when I paid they refused to remove. BT quality is awful nowadays  overpriced and they act in bad faith so stay clear  these days there are many other amazing companies offering the same service. I'm now very happy with NowTV for Broadband owned by sky despite of not even need a TV package.~~~,London W2~~~,2021-05-07~~~,1,1,3,2

"Unfortunately I get my phone  tv and broadband with BT   after couple of weeks no tv  failed call-backs  when I bought the package  for £24.99 for 18 months  3 months later it has risen  constant crashing  going offline  I was offered 'fast broadband'  3-10mbps its what I got offered and told by BT I cant watch TV or call anyone  same with tv I cant go online I only joined end of Jan 2021  its been painful bad experience. I also for my website upload videos to YouTube for my site  it used to take 20mins average on old supplier  BT it's up to 24 hours which means I have to sit with no tv or phone. I recently learned there was a faster broadband connection when I was told there wasn't  I recently took the upgrade and today (2nd May) BT have now cancelled that upgrade ""due to technical issues""  now I'm back to square one same response 2we're offering what you bought"" . Unfortunately I have another 2 years of pain with BT before I can finally leave them  DO NOT GO TO BT******* p.s/ Broadband speed and reliability  I would give zero stars  rather than 1 star  I gave above~~~",Paisley~~~,2021-05-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Only been with BT for one month and it's been the worst experience having to deal with their incompetence. We had to settle for ADSL initially as fibre wasn't available even though the cabinet supported it due to limited capacity. We had to wait nearly 3 weeks for an OpenReach engineer because BT claimed that there wasn't a line going into the property even though the previous occupants had Fibre 2 with BT. Unsurprisingly  the engineer informed us that there was already a line going into the property. In the interim  we were mis-sold their Halo Hub which should have got us online until the broadband was activated however the connection was unreliable due to EE's coverage in our area and consistently dropped out. We asked to cancel it but were told that we'd have to cancel the whole order and risk another 3 week wait for the OpenReach engineer. They advised to wait until the order had completed before cancelling. When we finally got online  we were told that we couldn't cancel the Halo as we were past our cool-off period even though we'd specifically asked for them to make a note when we originally requested the cancellation. Fibre 2 is now available to us however they claim that we can only upgrade to Fibre 1  or Fibre 2 with Halo for an inflated cost because we're currently in contract even though Fibre 2 is available to new customers for a reduced cost. We raised a complaint and were told that we'd get a call-back on 2 occasions but were never contacted. BT claims that complaints are handled by a 3rd party who are not employed by BT so they have no control of when they get in touch. We're still no closer to receiving the service we require from BT  nor do we have any confidence that we'll ever receive it.~~~,Stroud~~~,2021-04-30~~~,1,1,1,1
I joined BT in March and to say i'm unimpressed is an understatement! we're the 27th April and they've managed to bill me nearly £100 in that time  they've INCREASED my monthly plan (something to do with government increase)I live in a 2 bedroom flat and the WIFI only works in the front bedroom!!!!!

Dreadful service and installation. Avoid at all costs.  Agreed a date for installation and the engineer visited and then left without doing anything.  Called the engineers mobile and he did not answer.  Existing broadband was turned off.  Called BT to find out what was happening. 40 minute wait on telephone to speak to someone who said they would call back with an answer.  They did not call back. Another 40 minute wait to speak to someone.  They said that it would be another two weeks before an engineer could visit.  Only resolution to get broadband connection was they would post a dongle.  Will believe it when I see it.  Don't use BT it is dreadful~~~,Cheshire~~~,2021-04-27~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
By sent three discs to help me get broadband throughout my house. It failed so by asked me to return the discs. They failed to send the return label and then reminded me That if I failed to send the back in time I would be charged I then rang BT yet again and asked him to send a return label what you would think would be a simple task a week later I am still waiting what abysmal service one gets from BT shame on you BT~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2021-04-27~~~,1,1,2,1
The BT service is so unreliable. I work from home like a lot of people currently and every day the service drops off. There is constantly an engineer in the road. The option of watching a movie via Netflix is a vague memory as it stops at least 5 times per programme  my husband spends half his time checking  the speed and we are yet to receive the promised refund for any poor service. We have upgraded so many times to try and get a better service and are currently on fibre halo 2 over £65 per month and have had nothing but rubbish service for the duration. BT are a joke  it obviously stands for brilliantly terrible! They are a disgrace!~~~,Rhiddlan~~~,2021-04-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Wow I have just read some of these reviews and agree with all the negative ones! Just wish I read them before we decide to switch supplier. The pattern is the same that everyone below has reported - they miss the switch date and blame Openreach (when the same socket has worked with our previous supplier for years). We’ve spoken to managers  we’ve been promised compensation (£25 is the max you’ll get). I’d advise anyone: avoid BT  plusnet and EE (all the same company). We are six days into our contract  no internet  no sign of a contractor which we have been repeatedly promised for days). I’ll be cancelling come Monday!~~~,Southampton~~~,2021-04-16~~~,1,1,1,1
DONT PICK BT FOR ANYTHING I was conned into joing BT via a black Friday deal I saw online. This was not the case and they started to charge me £45 a month instead of £30. They started charging this bogus amount once you are out of the grace period  meaning if you want to leave by the time you realise they are charging you £45 instead of £30 you will have to pay an extortionate amount in cancellation fees. They are currently charging me £316.93 to leave this con of theirs. My advice would be to stay away from BT  any offers they put are clearly lies and far from the truth. I have been forced to stay in contract with these cons. I would like to share my experience so others would not fall for the same trap~~~,London~~~,2021-04-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Really really bad company. Poor service and extremely poor customer service.  When they make mistakes (and pretty huge ones at that)  they refuse to accept responsibility.  We moved our phone & internet to them on the promise of cheap broadband and phone.  We asked to keep our phone number of 20 years. They agreed. When the move took place they disconnected our phone number and gave it away. They insisted that they no longer supported landlines and that we had to have a new digital number.  This is not what they promised  so we left.   Efforts to restore our number with our new provider have been thwarted at every turn by BT out of sheer spite.  Their representatives accept no responsibility whatever and had the audacity to blame us for their error.  When that was getting them nowhere they then blamed Openreach.  Openreach have no responsibility for phone numbers at all. Bad bad bad company. Could not care less.  I wish that I could block all their phone numbers just to give them a taste of their own medicine.~~~,London ~~~,2021-04-15~~~,1,1,1,1

Terrible company.  We were lured with promises of faster broadband. More reliable service. Keeping our existing phone number.  ALL LIES. Service was erratic and unreliable.  If we wanted internet service in all areas of our home then BT expected us to pay more. As for our telephone line  they disconnected that without warning  gave our telephone number away and denied ever agreeing to provide a telephone service.   Doesn’t BT stand for British Telecom?  Maybe it’s British Teletubbies  it was explain your childish and irresponsible behaviour.~~~,London ~~~,2021-04-09~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been a BT customer for many years. Firstly they never informed me my broadband contract was up and secondly they would not let me sign up to one of their deals because I am a current customer.

was waiting almost 4 months for installation.In the beginning of March phone line has been connected.Today engineer supposed to finish work but he said I can't have full fibre internet even though contract has been signed for it.Instead I have been offered to sign contract for much slower Internet for the same price.But internet would be ready after 1-2 weeks.Bt is blaming me for that because I supposed to check if I can have specific cables in my building.How could I know I have to check this?They had 4 months for telling me this.Now I have been left without internet and can't go back to my previous provider unless I will pay double.So if you think to switch to BT you may end it up without internet at all.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2021-03-31~~~,1,1,1,1
Shocking Service as usual from BT. Ordered broadband fibre in December - Installation to the street was completed but due to Covid could not install in the house - and quite right too I would say  BUT advised of an appointment at the end of March to complete the installation  text to confirm the times - but no one pitched up for the appointment. 30 min on hold to find out whats up  but I get told by the operator to hold while she checks. The call is cut off  no return call  no news. SO I call back - I need to set up a new appointment online - Okay I do so. Next appointment - guess what no one turns up  no news. What a joke - unprofessional and absolutely useless as a company.~~~,KETTERING~~~,2021-03-31~~~,1,1,3,3

Very happy since switching from Virginmedia. Very flexible landline deal - I switched from a 700 free minutes on the landline to a second BT sim including 2GB data as wasn't using the landline allowance with a very efficient phone call. Description:28/3/2021 - 0657 BEWARE OF VIRGIN MEDIA CONTRACT LOOPHOLES WHEN ENDING THEIR CONTRACT! The fact that virgin media is exceptional in refusing to allow new providers to initate contract termination when transferring to a new landline/broadband provider is poor customer service. It is clearly just intended to grab a few more months subscription from customers who are unaware of this loophole but bound by a contract which is counter-intuitive and underhand. BT warn on their website that Virgin is pretty much unique in this - you did the same to me despite delaying porting of my landline over to BT 19/2/2021. Yet you refuse to acknowledge that this request was due to a transfer of phone and data service to a competitor and continue to bill me monthly until I called you after a wait  to spell this out with no understanding or concession from your off-shore call centre. I'm posting this feedback as widely as I can to warn other customers.~~~,north west~~~,2021-03-28~~~,4,5,4,4
