Horrendous service. Was stupidly drawn back to BT by a special offer. Cancelled the order  after 6 hours on the phone to hopeless helplines having conversations I'd had 20 times before with incompetent staff  trying to resolve simple set up issues. AVOID AT ALL COSTS~~~,east lothian~~~,2016-01-09~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
BT are completely and utterly useless.Spent god knows how many hours on the phone to an Indian call centre trying to get a line with broadband installed in a new home in Western Scotland.Still waiting after 3 weeks.They really should be ashamed of themselves and Ofcom should come down on them like a ton of bricks.~~~,West Scotland~~~,2016-01-09~~~,1,1,1,1
BT internet is probably the worst out of all the providers out there. Why is this? Well if you leave your router on overnight  90% of the time you will have to reset it as it comes buggy and download speed become so slow you want to blow your brains out. After resetting our router 90% of the time the lights will flash orange and stay there for a good 5 minutes. This means that there is some kind of internet connection error. When it eventually wants to work you never get the download speeds you pay for. I have 13mb/s appaerently tops i get 4 and a good day 7. Stingy company limit the use of your browsing speed. So unreliable that if you play games you f.king spike evey 5 minutes or so  which means ending the other side of the map. Cant handle more that 2 computer users at once because LAG.  The funny part about bt is you could have a supercomputer and they be like 'have you restarted your computer sir?' 'Have you got a virus sir?' 'Is your phone signal good sir?' 'Maybe its because you are too far away from the router sir' 'is there any devices such as phones which could disrupt the signal sir' 'Do one or more people live in your house sir which could interfere with the signal sir?' 'How many devices are connected to the router sir?' The biggest load of bu11sh1t you can think of they will ask. F them. Companies such as virgin media are like gods compared to this crap. 0 stars.~~~,glasgow~~~,2016-01-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Anyone thinking of taking any product with bt DONT after being told everything would be installed last month it is still not.3 wasted days off work with the most recent  them not even bothering to tell me no one is coming even though they knew there was a problem so weren't sending anyone !~~~,Manchester~~~,2016-01-08~~~,1,1,1,1
AVOID AVOID. Horrible company. They put you through to south east asia . Highly Incompetent . They charge you for service you dont use.~~~,Uk~~~,2016-01-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Sad Sad sad!!! Years ago worked for BT when it provided a brilliant customer focussed service! Yes it had not been privatised. Now! Take out TV and Broadband contract 30th December  TV not operable remote and box suspect  engineer booked for three hour slot! Does not arrive one hour on phone to India three contacts. Transpires engineer reported not enough parking space? (There was!) But not contact!Moral unless you have parking for gigantic vehicles! Dont use BT.On their plus side presented first bill within 6 days   so they can be quick.Also may help if you can speak Indian.~~~,Kettering~~~,2016-01-07~~~,1,1,4,4
It's a shame I have to give a minimum of one star  I can not even fathom how this garbage company can even exist.Our internet and land line went down on the 17th of December  it is now the 6th of January and it seems that nothing has been done to fix the problem.Must be since we live away from crowded areas that BT couldn't care less if their services work or not.The best part is that they still feel like it is acceptable to bill is for a month of nonexistent services.Even when we try and try to phone them to see if any progress has been made  we get put through to someone useless person on the other end who couldn't care less about our situation and we have been hung up on several times. The deadline for this problem to be fixed has been postponed several times  first it was the 22nd  then the 24th. Then they decided to give themselves a bit of room to sit on their chairs and do nothing so it was the 4th and then they said and I quote 'it will definitely be fixed by the 6th  100%' and here I am on the night of the 6th wondering how BT even have customers anymore. I honestly wouldn't wish this sort of service into my worse enemies. Absolutely appalling!~~~,Anglesey~~~,2016-01-06~~~,1,1,1,1
OK until something goes wrong. One of the most frustrating customer service experiences I've ever had. I reported a fault on the 19th December and have received nothing but empty promises since. I was initially told that things would be up and running by the 24th Dec. I rang on the 24th and was told to wait until the 31st. I rang on the 31st and was told the line would be fixed on the 4th Jan. I called on the 4th and was told it would be ready on the 5th. Called on the 5th  told it would be ready today. Have just come off the phone having being told I'll now have to wait until the 8th before they can fob me off again. Same excuses every time. On top of that I still haven't had a call divert put in place that was promised to me on the 4th Jan. I've been a customer with you for years.~~~,Northumberland~~~,2016-01-06~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2
This service is very poor the signal drops regularly and is not available in all rooms of the house. The customer service is not helpful as they have advised to go back to Sky when I challenged their poor service.~~~,Ayr~~~,2016-01-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Product (infinity 2) is drastically overpriced  but it works isn't too slow  no complaints about service! Router isn't bad either :) but  when asked if I want to keep my phone number I said yes  they changed it  I've since called 10+ times and the only thing they've managed to do is change my number to another completely random number  ridiculous. I was also unable to login to my BT  so unable to pay bills and see details for 3 weeks  this has since been sorted. Customer service is terrible. Bt is good  if it goes to plan.~~~,Midlands ~~~,2016-01-06~~~,3,1,4,4
Spent over 30 hours on the phone  BT took four months to turn on broadband and decided to turn sport on and off as they pleased despite me paying for it. During my 12 month contract they decided to 'auto-recontract' me for a further twelve months from when they finally got broadband working - this is a bullying tactic by BT and I did not agree to extend my contract. I've just come to the end of a three month debacle (phone  email  all sorts of charges being added on) to finally get rid of BT. Stay away not worth the hassle at all!~~~,Leeds~~~,2016-01-06~~~,1,1,1,1
I would give minus 1 if I could same old as everyone else  my phone bills only ever were 50.00 month max moved to bt when we moved house now touching £115.00 month when I was assured max bill would be £40.00 I also felt staff were very smug when speaking to poor trained staff.I will now only communicate through email until my contract finishes next month YIPPEE!!!I am now in communication with the Ombudsman and advise everyone on this website to do the same~~~,shropshire~~~,2016-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
We had our phone line and broadband fitted on 32/12/15 but we have yet to have any service from BT. We have called BT on numerous occasions and all they keep saying is  you have to wait 24 hours for the broadband to get set up. Call again  still no internet... Oh it's showing as order is incomplete  you'll have to wait another 24 hours. Again checked this morning and yet again still no internet. It's a joke! We are extremely unhappy with their shocking bad customer service. Rude and incompetent customer service team who seem to pass on the buck to another member of staff. Fed up with it now  wish we had Virgin in our area!~~~,Plymouth~~~,2016-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Disgusting. Lower than dirt. Lower than bedrock! I have had another of many terrible experiences with this diabolical company. This time I was due to finally get a way overdue broadband a month ago. 4 times they were supposed to come. 4 times they failed to with absolutely no notice. 4 afternoons I've booked off from work as they say make sure someone is home! Plus I am now past their 14 day cooling period so if I call and say forget it  I have to pay anyway! Their customer service agents are disrespectful and rude  with a cLearly uninterested attitude. Due to my location  I can't get access to any other broadband provider at the moment. BT are not only aware of this  they are the ones that pointed this out to me! If you are in an area that can get any other service  do it~~~,Lichfield~~~,2016-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely rubbish  keep sending engineers to fit a line when there is only a bit of rope in the manhole/duct then they find the duct stops a foot from the local point. Today I had to kidnap the engineer and ended up with the police on the phone to BT to explain how rubbish they were!~~~,Slough~~~,2016-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is terrible. I'm typing this review from my mobile phone as the house broadband has failed for the second night running which has meant that the new Samsung TV can't now be watched and although the stupid BT box has been restarted (for the third time)  the internet still fails to work. I advised against switching from Virgin  looks like I was right. Avoid BT like the plague - it's useless.~~~,Cardiff ~~~,2016-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Sold me broadband the fastest you can get ye right it never worked they couldn't connect me then they told me it would take 30 days to connect me & I wouldn't get full speed I cancelled sent it back & moved over to sky bt carried on taking payments out of my bank I thought it was for line rental found out when sky take over they take on the line rental as well bt have done nothing but tried to rip me off since as I can't get my money back off them I would never consider ever using bt again & wouldn't trust them don't do it go with sky or anyone else~~~,West Midlands ~~~,2016-01-03~~~,1,1,1,1
We have BT Infinity  in the last 6 months  we have only received acceptable download speeds for 6 weeks  mostly the speed in the evening is around 5mbps  we should be getting a min of 60.  What a rip off  as soon as Virgin hit this area  they have a new customer waiting!~~~,Kinross-shire~~~,2016-01-02~~~,2,2,2,1
Terrible service  appalling communication   non existent customer service . I have been a client for eighteen months and requested an upgrade   it has taken nearly 6 weeks to date   I have made 8 hours of calls   have been on hold for 4 hours  and now have been disconnected with no explanation but have been charged . Please do not subscribe to BT you will regret it~~~,York~~~,2016-01-02~~~,1,1,3,2
So after a month of waiting  6 phone calls  50 unwanted text messages and a half day loss of earnings I have told bt where they can stick there service. Waited 2 weeks for an engineer appointment  took the morning off  he arrived and did his work and I thought that would be that. I received the router a few days late due to a delivery miss hap  but when it finally arrived I thought it would be a simple effort of plug and play. Unfortunately not the case. After several hour long calls to a outsourced call centre to get the account activated  it turns out the engineer needed to complete more work. This involved me taking more time off work ( further loss of earnings) because they don't work weekends  and the appointment would have been a full 6 weeks after the order was placed. This was by far the worst customer service I have ever encountered  and I would recommend genital amputation before recommending bt.....it would be less painful.~~~,London~~~,2015-12-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
As a rule I don't use the internet alot. But when I do I am most disappointed with the speed. I upgraded 2 years ago to fibre and have not seen any great change.Just this month I bought a TV box for films  these are downloaded off the nett which has pushed my use up. I have now realised I only get 40Mb  so anything over is chargable. I read my average use has previously been 14Mb. So a little disappointed and looking to improve my allowance and service.~~~,oldham~~~,2015-12-30~~~,2,2,2,2
Awful service. I ordered over a month ago. Was given an install date for an engineer to visit my house. He never turned up. They never called. I called them to be put through to a Indian call centre to be told i would get a call back within 48hrs. I received nothing. two more times i called two more times waiting for a call back... nothing. How they can run a company i do not know.~~~,Cirencester~~~,2015-12-30~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Absolutely dire.   Changed from Sky to BT a couple of months ago  to take advantage of the BT Sport offer.  Worst decision I've made.   I'll be contacting them after Christmas to see if I can come out of my contract early.  Download speed is measured in minutes not seconds.   Broadband disconnects virtually every day  usually in the middle of something. Kids complaining as buffering makes playing games on their PCs/Xboxes is almost impossible. I remember having internet connection 20 years ago via telephone line which was better than this.~~~,Kidsgrove~~~,2015-12-29~~~,1,2,1,1
"following an installation by a ""telephone Line Engineer""I had no services for 19 days as he had been unskilled and unable to connect to the junction box correctly  like so many more B.T. has left us stressed out as the whole organisation is incompetent with the management hiding in their ivory tower in Durham and seemingly unapproachable leaving their Indian call centre staff to take all the flak  if you value your sanity and peace of mind you will stay well clear of what is probably the worse business I have dealt with in all my 82 years~~~",wroughton~~~,2015-12-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I would be dishonest if I gave even one star rating for any aspect of the service. We have suffered 18 months of unreliable broadband. Over Christmas it has been impossible to watch a programme without it dropping out. Each of the many times we have contacted BT to get it fixed we have had extremely poor service  even to the point of BT lying to us.  As soon as our contract comes to an end we will happily switch.

Customer service is appalling. Customer services are farmed out to India who are generally unhelpful. After 2 months I gave up trying to get my e-mail set up and got an outlook address instead. They still send e-mails to me at a Google address which I don't use even after telling them that they were using the wrong address. As soon as my contract expires I will be moving to an alternative provider. All in All BT should be avoided~~~,Lancashire~~~,2015-12-26~~~,1,1,3,3
Normally by are on a par with most services  although being the leading communications provider one would hope they would be above the rest  however my recent experience has shown a significantly worse side to the company. I reported a fault in the phone line over 10 days ago. They have still not committed to when they will fix it and have left me without telephone or internet. This experience has left me in outrage over the terrible response times. Sadly there is no other company we can switch to that can offer better service as they all run off bt's lines. I'm very disappointed in this company.~~~,Somerset~~~,2015-12-23~~~,1,2,2,1
Having closed my account 3 years ago they went on and defaulted my account for 4 months later which affected my credit rating. Sent letter with details it was their fault  called 6 times and never heard back from them. 4 months waiting now and still nothing. Unacceptable and will never ever use again.~~~,BRISTOL~~~,2015-12-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Had no broadband since 07/12/2015 bt says they won't reinstate the service till 04/01/2016. Staff are doing anything to speed things up. No coordination within BT  keep being called by people who have no clue of what had been said before and keep repeating my self. Somebody should take the lead  but there is no ownersh of the case~~~,Poole~~~,2015-12-23~~~,1,1,1,1
customer of bt fibre optic i recieved a phonecall from bt to continue my contract for a further time so i dont lose bt sport i agreee and a few months later bam btsport is chargable i was lied to and mislead. when i called its s centre in india the guy kept talking over me and didnt listein. il be leaving btbroadband in 4 months be careful what they promise you utter liars.~~~,london~~~,2015-12-23~~~,1,1,1,1

Rubbish wifi   Would not recommend BT   can't wait till my contract is up~~~,Liverpool~~~,2015-12-21~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
having been promised a telephone line engineer would install my line when i transfered to B.T. on dec 20 2013 instead an incompetent contractor turned up in an un-marked van  quickly carrying out some sub- standard wiring and left without checking the line with the result that myself 82 y.o. and my severely disabled 79 y.o. wife was left without a phone for 19 days over the festive season and B.T. couldn't care less  it was two years ago today and i m still fighting for a settlement  i am now in my 83 year and I have never dealt with a worse firm  they rely on their call centre workers to make all the excuses while their managers are un-obtainable in their ivory mansion in Durham  definitely a no star company which prospective customers should stay well away from as they don't know the meaning of customer service and as for satisfaction you will get none with B.T.~~~,swindon~~~,2015-12-20~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
They do not ever help with anything my broadband always cuts out and i'm supposed to be on the best package they have got. not amused tonight my internet has lagged out 30+ times in the last hour this is a daily thing and i cannot wait until i can change provider. DO NOT GET BT!~~~,Stroud~~~,2015-12-19~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The worst broadband you could get. Have to reboot every 30 min or so . Absolute rubbish going back to Virgin asap.~~~,east kilbride~~~,2015-12-19~~~,1,~~~,3,1
I have changed provider from Virgin to BT. Want to go back to Virgin because phone does not receive incoming calls even after 19 days. BT want to charge me £283 for changing back. Had 2 appointments for an engineer to come out and repair  Neither time did anyone come. Customer care outsourced to India. The people are very hard to understand  and do not resolve the problem. Absolutely totally frustrated. I have never known of such poor service before. I wish I had not changed provider to BT.~~~,Derby~~~,2015-12-19~~~,~~~,~~~,4,4

Keeps dropping out making You tv unwatchable.
