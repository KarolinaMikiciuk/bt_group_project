Absolute rubbish service past from pillar to post eventually said I wanted to cancel and put through to another department put on hold for thirty minutes then line went dead rang back to yet another call center who said they finished at nine o'clock don't touch bt with a barge pole~~~,Southampton~~~,2017-01-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Can't wait to get out of this contract. The worst customer service ever experienced~~~,Chesterfield~~~,2017-01-23~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
As per other reviews  the customer service provided is terrible. Very unhelpful staff (BT raised prices last year to provide better customer service!). They will terminate the call if they don't understand your issue.Complaint handlers say they will resolve the issues but never do. The problem just goes on and on and no one will do anything. BT prices are constantly going up to fund the Premier League  I am moving on.~~~,Somerset~~~,2017-01-23~~~,1,1,1,1
23rd Jan 2017 and been without bt internet since NOVEMBER 2016.  I have rung them endless times  been re-assured endless times that they will fix it within 24hrs.  Been told they have emailed technical support many times to find out next time I ring that no record of emails !!!!  Advised to ask for a supervisor... dont do that they simply cut you off.  Had new hub... engineer out... still no luck !!!  Have spent hours waiting in for phone calls that never came.  Engineer supposed to come tomorrow  ( am having to take MORE time off work.)  If it is not fixed tomorrow then I am closing my account.  NEVER EVER use/trust BT.  Worst suppliers of any service anywhere.  Have only put 1 star as there isnt a 0 box.~~~,Masham N Yorkshire~~~,2017-01-23~~~,1,1,1,1
This is the worst internet provider I have ever had  and I come from what the UK would consider a 3rd world country. The reliability is horrific as internet goes down every 2 hours for no apparent reason. Sometimes it goes down for up 6 times in a row which makes it impossible to do anything really. Took 2 weeks to replace a router (which I suspected as the being the problem at first). Speed is mediocre as well.I do not recommend this internet provider to anyone unless you enjoy getting angry often.~~~,Birmingham~~~,2017-01-22~~~,1,1,2,1
Tried to upgrade from residential to business in July 2016 for  promised UK call centres and better service.  I tried to switch from BT residential to BT Business for my phone and broadband in July 2016  for promised U.K. Call centres and better service.  They have made so many mistakes in this process I have lost count.   My phone was transferred and a direct debit set up.  My broadband was not transferred in error.  In November I rang to sort it out.  As a result  my Broadband was transferred to BT Business  but I kept receiving overdue reminders for the account. I rang yesterday to sort out the direct debit for the Broadband account.  During the conversation I found out that back in November when my Broadband was moved  they closed my BT Business phone account  and transferred it back to Residential.   So as things stand right now  my phone line is currently back with Residential BUT my calls have not been billed to either account since November (glad I found out now  not in 5 years' time - I'm told they bill you retrospectively).   I have now received an email saying that they are closing my Business Broadband account.   All I want is my phone and my broadband to sit with BT Business  with active direct debits in place.  Is that too much to ask?~~~,Hereford~~~,2017-01-22~~~,1,1,3,3
Only given 1 star because there isn't a zero rating. Appalling service from the outset. I have been shocked that this level of service exits today. Please stay clear of BT.~~~,West Midlands~~~,2017-01-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling speed 0.4 - 0.6 at best. Their customer contact email will not recognise the account number given by BT on my account. Thus impossible to register a complaint! Tried telephoning. Get cut off by call centre staff every time after explaining the problem.~~~,Cupar~~~,2017-01-21~~~,1,2,1,1
So called superfast unlimited broadband is expensive  slow and recently keeps cutting out.  Talking to BT online is a nightmare because they never check previous records and you have to start again each time  also very slow.Hoping to change provider soon.~~~,Reading~~~,2017-01-21~~~,2,2,3,3
BT Fibre Broadband. I have been waiting since July 2016 for broadband to be fitted. So far totally appauling service. Engineer failed to turn up twice. Impossible to contact BT I have spend 6 hours on telephone being not answered  cut off  redirected. This has to be the worst company in Britain~~~,Chigwell~~~,2017-01-18~~~,1,1,1,1
AVOID. Dreadful service. Had to phone > 6 times to get direct debit sorted. Credit card details and security code given over 4 times. Each time verbal confirmation that all was well now. In spite of this   BT suspended internet without warning. Manager in UK office was offhand and said I should take a business contract  but denied that ordinary customers are treated worse than business - which doesn't augur well for businesses. Promises to call back and confirm arrangements in writing not kept. Conflicting information from customer services.~~~,Midlands~~~,2017-01-17~~~,1,1,1,1

6 months of low speed broadband and counting Moved to Camber from S. E. London  where we had Virgin broadband at 70 mbps. Had to switch to BT at Camber as no alternative. Opted for BT infinity hoping for reasonable speed. Best so far 16mbps and that was by a BT engineer with a hard wired meter Typically 8-12 mbps. So far 5 engineers visits and hours online with no improvement. Yesterday down to 5 mbps again  contacted BT  they tested line and agreed there is a problem. Will send engineer but warned may charge Â£129 if fault is in house  note they installed line in house and charged for it. Tested it today  2.5 mbps  received message from BT informing me that they have now found fault on line and will fix it  but not until 19/01/2017. I despair  especially as they have a monopoly  No point in switching as all suppliers have to use the same line.~~~,Camber~~~,2017-01-15~~~,1,1,1,1
17 Mb/s Im having  aways gives me about 1-2 Mb/s download speed. Customer Service never replies (phone/facebook/email). I you have a choice DO NOT go for BT. I have to stay with them since it's the only one provider in my area...~~~,SW London~~~,2017-01-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Been with bt since october 2016 (why did I change ) slight cock up with the switch over. Broadband switch off Thursday evening no notice no reason we sighned up for 12 months after spending two and half hours on the o yes  it's good to talk they admit they have made a mistake but no sorry and will turn it back on Monday so no service till then and no refund back to virgin in October~~~,Scunthorpe ~~~,2017-01-13~~~,1,1,1,1

I would rate customer service as appalling if it existed at all. The fact is you literally cannot get hold of anyone who seems to understand  or is able to sort your problem.Despite numerous calls to report an intermittent fault with broadband and landline  I am still no nearer having the issue resolved. I have had a call centre operative in India tell me that the problem is my router ( how she could check from the other side of the world is beyond me  and I work in telecomms).I was subsequently sent a replacement router which turned out to be older than the one I have and needless to say did absolutely nothing to solve the problem  this I immediately sent back. I have tried without success to obtain a UK phone number or email address and wish I had never signed up to BT  I know that the problem with my service is the old copper cable dangling from the pole outside my house  it has been ther since the house was built 55yrs ago. This cable  has been swinging in the wind  rain  snow and ice for all those years and has obviously degraded  but unfortunately BT operatives don't seem to understand what I'm talking about and refuse to do anything other than send me replacement routers ???. Awful service.~~~,west lancashire~~~,2017-01-11~~~,1,1,3,1

Can only review on customer service as an engineer never attended to install the phone lone/broadband. After receiving a bombardment of reminder messages emails and phone calls to ensure I did not forget my appointment  I booked the afternoon off work to wait for the engineer. Needless to say the engineer never turned up and there was no message/email/phone call to explain. I tried to call the engineer direct whos number I was sent prior who did not reply. I tried to get some answers on online chat that evening with no joy. I called the next day after not receiving a call from them to explain and when they finally found my order they could not give me answers as to what happened. All I was told was that I would have to wait longer for a different provider. Shouldn't be hard to provide a better servive.~~~,Wiltshire~~~,2017-01-10~~~,1,1,1,1
All I can say is this company is disgusting being a customer service manager myself I have never expirienced such a poor level of service  they accidentally cut me off for over a week when I work from home so I was at a loss of earnings I had the phone put down on me 8 times!! I had one person become abusive and two make false promises that weren't even noted on my account. I was then told I would have an amount credited to my account due to loosing my service and instead the debited the amount Aswell as also charging me Â£20 extra on my bill for services with no notification which they are required to do by law. Then I get the news they are charging me Â£32 on charges because my bill wasn't paid on time due to the fact I was waiting on a call been listened to that never actually got sent to be listened to them one lovely chap said we will send debt collectors. Now I'm taking them to court to recover the funds I lost in earnings Aswell as compensation we will see who has the last laugh.~~~,Leeds~~~,2017-01-10~~~,1,1,3,2
after being persuaded by BT adverts to purchase their latest smarthub (74.99)  I find it practically unusable due to my download speed of 0.24 mbs  which running BT's own speedtester I am informed is acceptable for my line  although my contract claims up to 17 mbs  going through BT's online help program took the best part of 2 hrs  as I kept getting cut off and was forced to join the waiting Queue again  and was informed at the end my broadband was working correctly  unfortunately there was not one jot of improvement  I feel badly let down by BT  with whom I have been a loyal customer and when my contract ends I will never renew it with them.~~~,1 macmillan place caol fort-william~~~,2017-01-08~~~,1,1,1,1
poor speed and when I try to upgrade to infinity it does not recognize my address or in fact me as a customer~~~,westbury~~~,2017-01-08~~~,1,1,1,1
The most frustrating company I've ever dealt with. Broadband problems (frequent intermittent drop-outs) for months. Regular phone calls to their 0800 111 4567 'help' centre. Each time I kid myself into thinking that this time I'll get someone on the line who can help. Each time they read their scripts and pretend to be sorry. Engineer visits to fix their faulty lines are a waste of time. One day they say it's my faulty home-wiring  the next day it's the BT exchange  and then a different excuse  but no solution. It's gone on now so long I think I've found the problem myself (following countless hours research) but getting BT to make a tiny configuration change at their end has so far proved beyond me (despite many calls/emails). If you can avoid BT then do so. At the very least avoid any long term contracts with them.~~~,Hampshire UK~~~,2017-01-07~~~,1,1,1,1
8 days after install and still no broadband  customer services unhelpful and feel like I haven't got what I have asked for with no date of expected completion to make it work and they will still start billing me if you have a line already choose another provider~~~,Surrey~~~,2017-01-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Poor customer service. Great internet speed but pretty pointless if the internet connection drops out at least 9 times a day. No one gets back to you in a reasonable time. Hopeless. Worse internet ever.~~~,Chichester ~~~,2017-01-06~~~,1,1,5,1
Their sales team are veritable pirates  as what I read on here confirms. Selling deals that are not the best for customer and yet locking you into a contract you can do nothing about and being told you are on this contract and that cancellation is a chargeable action.  They also RAISED the price in breach of our 12 month contract  and yet if I wanted a better deal as I had been recommended a bad deal there was essentially nothing I could do.  I raised a complaint issue  and was to be offered a callback  which I had to wait 18 days for! This callback did not come  and when I called to find out why  I was told that the system said that they had called and spoken to me! I asked  so  um  what does it say was resolved in this non existent call?! Needless to say  there was no answer. They seriously need to sort out their sales team  they are chirpy rogues. I cannot speak for other departments  but they soured an entire lifetimes brand loyalty for me in chasing extra pounds. Well done /s I will not recommend this company to anyone. I certainly will not go to SKy as have no desire to line Murdochs pockets either. BT Sales and their contract are an utter shame and an abuse of my prior loyalty and trust.~~~,London~~~,2017-01-06~~~,1,1,2,4
Called BT and spoke with 3 different agents as well as speaking to someone online chat  I have been with another provider and contacted BT a couple of days ago  as I was keen to switch  well  what can I say  I thought I would be offered great service whilst in the process. I could not complete online  hence calling in  it appears the offers do not apply over the phone  even though it would not let me proceed online  that could not tell me when I could get phone line and only after phone line contract  at some point they would inform me of what kind of broadband price I could have ???? BT you are a disgrace to even imply your one of the best  I thought you guys would have been keen to encourage new custom  if that's the service you offered me and then wasn't sure what or when I could have a package  goodness knows what kind of poor after service I would have received  lucky escape I think~~~,Crawley~~~,2017-01-06~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The customer service is appalling  particularly offshore. They do not appear to keep notes on issues or discounts  the billing is haywire. Don't expect them to move you on the day  it took 7 weeks to get my service transferred. BT? - DON'T DO IT TO YOURSELF~~~,Guildford~~~,2017-01-06~~~,1,~~~,2,2
Just for starters I have had to put 1 star as could t leave 0. BT are by far the worst company we have ever had to deal with. We were originally miss sold a package. Told we would be getting a certain speed for broadband with BT sport thrown in as well. But when the confirmation email came through the next day it stated something completely different. We called BT and were told it needed to be investigated and the original phone call listed to. If we were right they would honor what was originally said for the same price. They then said the process would take until the 4th Jan. We know we were right so agreed to wait with the knowing it would be resolved. I stayed home all day yesterday (the 4th) waiting for my phone call from Sam who claimed to be a complaints manager. I even called myself a couple of times to chase the situation. Everyone that I spoke to said that they could t deal with it and I had to wait for Sam  but not one person knew where she was or if she was even in? One guy even told me off the record that we were right but had to speak to Sam to get it sorted. All day her direct number went to answerphone and my mother in law sent emails as well. We had waited 2 weeks and wanted an answer!Anyway we heard NOTHING yesterday from Sam the complaints manager. And at 8.10am this morning the phone rings  low and behold it's her... Sam then goes on to ask me AGAIN to tell her the situation as she still needs to listen to the call!!?? Hang on a minute why have we waited 2 weeks then?? We then had to wait a further 45 mins for her to call back and tell us that we were right... However the best they can do is reduce it by Â£6 which is NOT what we were promised! Sam Willis was rude and ignorant and clearly didn't care about keeping or losing our custom. So after all that waiting they couldn't honor what we were told. If we had known that we would of cancelled 2 weeks ago instead of living with pretty much 0 connection.We have now signed up with Sky who straight away have given far better customer service! Let's hope the connection speed is better too! MY ADVICE IS DO NOT GO WITH BT! AVOID AT ALL COSTS!~~~,Braintree~~~,2017-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Breathtakingly awful service.  The sorry tale is too long and tedious to recount.  Suffice to say I just can't imagine what is going on at BT.  It is an utter shambles although the actual individuals I've spoken to on the phone are reasonable and doing their best.  There is clearly some massive fault in the basic running of the company.~~~,Bristol~~~,2017-01-05~~~,1,1,1,1
My BT broadband is not working since the end of November. We have called their staff several times; however the service they give is poor and they do not give a solution. Moreover  some staff hang up as we are talking. We request to move to another service provider but they lock us with the contract we have with them. They ask Â£150 to cancel the contract. I advise that if you want go to BT then don't sign the contract. Most customers like me also gave BT a bad review. BT are now thinking of money instead of their customers' service. I have made a lot of complaints but they did not take action. They don't have professional workers and service as they say that the contract said there will be no guaranteed Wi-fi. Also they make me angry and my blood pressure has gone high. Unfortunately  I don't want to give any stars above but you have to give stars to submit the review. I recommend you to go to a provider who gives Wi-fi that is guaranteed.~~~,Ilford~~~,2017-01-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Been with B.T. for about 10 years  iv'e moaned  complained  iv'e waited and waited  i even paid Microsoft thinking it was my P.C. that was the problem and that was a waste of Â£70  Back to B.T.Ive upgraded iv'e had 3 new routers in the last year  and over the years the speed has remained the same with no improvement to the line and i only live 2 miles from the switchboard  whenever you phone to moan you get shoved from pillar to post and at the end of the line it's the same thing unplug this unplug that switch this and that off  as if i have'nt already done that ?  Get a grip B.T. WE ARE PAYING good money for a poor service~~~,Fraserburgh~~~,2017-01-02~~~,2,2,1,1
If you move to this company be prepared to not get the service you paid for. Then be prepared for them not to care or do anything about it. I've got the highest broadband  complete with a multi room set up... or shall I say that is what I PAY for. I've been with BT for 8 months and just waiting until I can move in April. The TV has never worked and we just use the broadband to stream from the internet and even the internet just mysteriously drops out fairly regularly. I've spent hours and hours  waiting and on hold over the months. Passed from person to person  told someone will call me in a 2 hour window on 3 seoerate icassilns and just wasted my time as no one called. We've completely given up and resigned ourselves to the fact that BT was a complete waste of time and a massive inconvenience. We've. been in contact with the Ombudsman but their investigation said that we should be given a Â£75 goodwill gesture  whilst in the mean time we still pay more than hat per month whilst we count down the time until we can leave our contract. The bodies that look over companies such as BT need to wake up and read he 1000's upon 1000's of reviews in line and give BT an ultimatum to sort themselves out. If you do decide to go with BT after reading all of these reviews then you deserve the next 12 months of anger  frustration and wasted money~~~,Plymouth ~~~,2017-01-01~~~,1,1,1,1
Customer service team very unhelpful.  everytime i call them to complain about the net not working or the hub not working they just send new hubs so since the past 3 months ive had 5 hubs all faulty!! Big mistake joining bt~~~,London~~~,2016-12-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Joining BT is one of the worst decisions I have ever made!!  In the three months since joining I have had two faulty hubs and have been waiting for my third for over a month now. I've been fed a pack of lies about when this will arrive. I have spent hours (literally) on the phone or  more accurately  on hold to their call centres. I have now had to explain the situation an impressive 10 times to various people  who clearly can't help me. I have logged complaints and heard nothing back from them despite requesting someone contacts me. If I was charging an hourly rate for my time I'd have been on a nice little earner! Oh and another joy was having to verify my identity EVERY time I spoke to a different person as I had been entered as Mr. That was enjoyable and not at all irritating. However  one thing BT do very well and should pride themselves on is taking my money. Every month without fail - on the dot! No reflection in the charges of the fact that I've been without the internet for roughly a third of the time I've been a customer mind you.  So as I would warn off someone from dating a deadbeat ex  I feel I must do the same with BT. I'm in it up to my neck  for the next 9months at least. But you still have a chance to avoid it.~~~,Berkshire~~~,2016-12-29~~~,1,1,1,1
When broadband works it's OK but when it goes wrong  good luck. Horrific sums it up.can't believe this is able to go on in this day and age. Real shame football fans have to sign up to this to watch the game....~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2016-12-29~~~,1,~~~,1,1
After trying to convince Plusnet for a year that there was a broadband problem I switched to Vodafone. The problem persisted but then Vodafone agreed to send out a technician who found and fixed the problem in one afternoon. The technician (Martin Allison) was outstanding both in attitude and skills. Well done BT and well done Martin.~~~,Dunoon~~~,2016-12-29~~~,5,5,5,5
"I have rated them 1 stat as I couldn't put 0. This was my the worst ever customer service experience. I was moving my house and need to change my phone and broadband provider. BT had promised me to connect the service on the 12th December. Then I was called that there's a delay and phone line will be connected on the 20th December and on the 21 I will be called when Internet will be provided. There was no signal on the 20th and on the 21 I called the ""lairs"" from customer service and I was told that there was an error and I need to cancel my order and tomorrow they will placed a new order. I called BT on the next day (22nd) and I was told the same. They need to cancel my order and tomorrow they replace a new order. On the next day (23rd)I called BT to ask for a day of connection and I was told that due to an error they need to cancel my order... Then Christmas came. After Christmas 27th I called them to ask when... and I was told that due to an error they need to cancel my order... so guess what is going to happen tomorrow. Nothing was true what I was told. If you have an option to choose a different broadband provider please do it as BT will lay to you and never keep the promise.~~~",Newark~~~,2016-12-28~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
