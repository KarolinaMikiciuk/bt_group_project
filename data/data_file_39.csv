Still waiting for connection to phone  internet and tv. Promise after promise since 6th December. There is already a line to this property. There is only one of me and I swear I could do a better job at talking to my customers...~~~,Herefordshire~~~,2016-12-25~~~,1,1,1,1
2 year contract - didn't work for 12 months - spent literally days on the phone - 7 no show call outs which meant 7 days off work. Gave me £50 compensation. In all my time I have never known a company to be so bad. Even closing my account they forgot to take my last payment so 2 months down the line they threatened court action but decided never to tell me I hadn't paid.Will never return~~~,Pembrokeshire~~~,2016-12-24~~~,1,1,1,1

Being rural  we are supplied by phone and  broadband via copper wire from the exchange. 2.2 Mbs. I applied for BT infinity 5 years ago and checked progress with the upgrade  online. Two years ago I was advised that we would have Infinity within a year but when it didn't happen I contacted Openreach and they confirmed that we had slipped off the priority list and now we are not even on the schedule. Talk about not knowing what they are talking about.~~~,Sevenoaks~~~,2016-12-22~~~,2,1,1,2
BT have been shocking from the minute we signed with them.Took an age to get the internet and Wi-Fi set up in the first place main reason I went with them was to get BT Sport as well which is a nightmare to try and get on so never use it called two days ago to complain that the Wi-Fi speeds are really slow even though we pay for Fibre Optic Broadband  sent an engineer out who has blamed it on our wiring but now it is not working it all!!I have lost wi-fi and landline now and bearing in mind I run my business from home I am losing income all the time it is and they want to charge me £130 if the engineer comes out and says it's our fault even though it was working before the engineer came just slowly!~~~,Goole~~~,2016-12-21~~~,1,~~~,2,1
Disgusting service  the communication when you phone up BT is a joke  the agents are ignorant and the moment you want to complain  you will be cut off deliberately or sent on a run around  the complaints team will not address this part of your complaint  they will just ignore it and not respond to it formally  I have proof and ignorance is not an excuse. BT are scandalous and their complaints team is not impartial  they cover up and will try to spin doctor everything in any verbal communication and will simply not address anything formally in writing that is harmful to BT. The complaint handler will make a conclusion on a situation that occurred which is far from accurate and when you counteract it and expose the ignorance in the conclusion the handler will not respond to it specifically in the next email. Ignorance is not an excuse BT  sorry  do not act like your complaint handlers do not know what they are doing  it is all carefully contrived.   Takes approx an hour to get the complaints procedure with the name of the ombudsman they are signed up to when on the phone due to spin doctoring and shocking tactics.  Internet will cut out when it pleases and comes back when it pleases  been offered the same resolution twice that does not work and when offered it the third time you can only refuse.  Complaining does no help as mentioned  the complaint handler will ignore anything formally written that requires a response that could jeopardize T position in the complaint.  Stated explicitly not to be contacted verbally after taking legal advice  this was also stated in writing in my formal complaint to BT through the right channels but yes  you guessed it.. 2-3 calls to my mobile and landline  voice messages left on the mobile and landline  even started receiving text messages  almost laughable that they think this type of tactic/harassment is acceptable even after stating in black and white that you require BT to respond formally in writing only and not to call. But they call to figure you out  what you know and what you do not know to exploit to their advantage.  They claim to have the best wifi signal in the UK  from my experience  no way in hell is it even close.  As you can see from 90% of the reviews on this website in regards to BT  even the most recent ones... Avoid like the plague! Remember  if the broadband company does not provide you with the service contracted for  ask them for the ombudsman they are signed to and follow the correct channels for the formal complaint procedure  know your rights  you can have the contract cancelled without a fee under many circumstances and be entitled to compensation. Just make sure you log every problem you have because the BT team will deny them even though they can check the history on their end.  I speak from experience with proof  this is not opinion. I have it in black and white.~~~,London~~~,2016-12-21~~~,1,1,1,1
The broad band is terrible it is also very overpriced I was paying over 50 a month for bt infinity yet it had some really slow speeds~~~,Birmingham ~~~,2016-12-21~~~,~~~,3,~~~,~~~
I have just had to deal with the worst customer service i have ever encountered. The BT broadband in my home has slowed to the point of unusability and I was just told repeatedly by BT customer service that i am a liar  that the service is working fine and that BT are liable for WIFI anyway. I was told that all my internet enabled devices (6 in total) must all be broken and finally that BT feel the matter resolved and they are not sending out an engineer. Avoid BT!~~~,Gosport~~~,2016-12-20~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Don't do it  just don't. No other provider can be as poor as BT in terms of service provision. Coupled with the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Order placed on 22/11/16  after 3 unsuccessful attempts for BT to complete the order internally  I cancelled on 08/12/16. By which point I had been disconnected from my previous provider. A full refund was supposed to be paid within 5 working days - supposedly confirmed as actioned that day by a BT manager. Roll forward to 20/12/16 the refund has still not be processed. No accountability  no-one cares. Never using BT again.~~~,N Ireland ~~~,2016-12-20~~~,1,1,1,1
For an age we have had ongoing unresolved problems with noisy landline  poor broadband and poor picture quality on our television. BT are so difficult almost impossible to contact and discuss these issues. The latest contact we had a few weeks back we were advised that an Engineer would check our line at the exchange. We did receive a call a day or so after the Engineer was supposed to check our line yet when I asked what was found the BT person calling could not provide any report. The issues have continued and when I check fault tracking the latest landline fault remains unresolved since the 02/12/16  - 17 days ago. Seems they have given up. We live in an isolated property and wonder now about the condition of our underground line which I understand is copper cable. We subscribed to BT Infinity around 6 months ago and also bought new phones from BT thinking our service would improve - not so - it got worse. At a loss now what to do or where to go for help with this~~~,Tayport ~~~,2016-12-19~~~,1,1,1,1
The broadband is okay  not exceptional but okay. It drops from time to time at night but I experienced the same thing with Sky broadband  albeit  less frequently. The things that I really dislike are the fact that when you initially contact them  they tried to upsell me BT infinity  despite the fact that I clearly didn't need it; in addition to this  call and late payment charges are quite steep. I will definitely be migrating once this horrible contract is up.~~~,Battersea~~~,2016-12-19~~~,1,1,3,3
Paying an overpriced contract for whats nowadays considered an absolutely  pathetic upload and download rate thats stability can be considered that of the Titanic. It drops regularly to less than 500KB/s download and 200KB/s upload. Disgrace.~~~,Leeds~~~,2016-12-19~~~,1,2,1,1
Pathetic service from BT epecially if in a hurry to get an active line. They will promise you an installation date in approx 1-2weeks time and then tell you repeatedly on the day that it doesn't activate till midnight   then the next morning you will call as not activated and the will give you another date 2 weeks down the line. when questioned on why? they will blame BT Openreach so then you will contact them and they will blame BT. Its all a big joke and they will offer you absolutely nothing  leaving you with no internet to complete any business over the christmas period. Beyond Bad service   dont deserve 1 star at the moment.~~~,Ammanford~~~,2016-12-17~~~,1,1,1,1

BT have given me a poor service throughout my 30 months of use from them. Unfortunately in my area BT was the only fiber service I could get  the speeds they sold me on were never reached. I complained multiple times and asked them to improve the line but I was constantly told that the speeds I was shown on my computer  through the official BT Web page checker  were either wrong  in package limits or that they would send an engineer to the box who never arrived.  I never expected the speeds to be consistently at the level I was sold but being told that a 25 Mbps discrepancy is within my package limits  the highest one  is absurd. Plus every drop in the internet was categorised as a one off incident and therefore never needed investigating. In the end I gave up complaining as it was a waste of time. However when I left the property and got a £31 disconnect fee I was not happy. I disputed it as policy says you don't have to pay if you move to an address they can't provide to  but this does not count if you move abroad. I have been left feeling very bitter about BT and their service was consistently bad to the end. On my return to the UK I will never again be a BT customer.~~~,Lincolnshire~~~,2016-12-16~~~,1,1,2,2
I was a sky customer and had it for 2 years. Never had problems. I thought BT will be better than Sky but I was wrong. I switch to BT and got services after 10 days since the activation date. After 3 months I got problem again now since 8 December this month I haven't got broadband. First they said it will be sorted by 10 December then BT said it will be sorted by 14 December. Called on 14 December again new story  that somebody will call you on 15 December. Called BT today twice again new story somebody will call tomorrow. I HAVE NEVER EVER TO THIS SITUATION. Such a rubbish company. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE BT TILL I AM ALIVE. If you want to make your life miserable  stress or want to take revenge recommend them BT.~~~,Ilford~~~,2016-12-15~~~,1,2,1,1
"They stop my connection with my previous supplier while they were not in position to provide the service. And as solution they suggested that I should go and  buy a dongle somehwere and use it until they could resume the service.  This is what happen  I used to be a BT customer 2 and half years ago I moved my broadband service to EE as part of a deal on mobile phone. EE broadband was never as fast as BT. So when BT called me over a month ago mentioning that they had bought EE and if I wanted to come back to them I accepted. I asked three specific questions: 1) will i have to do anything  because I am extremely busy until Christmas and if i have to do anything it will have to wait until the new year. the response was I will just have to plug the new Hub in.the second question was if there will be any interruption with the supply as i run an IT business and need online communication with INDIA 24/7. the response was no  no interruption  not even one hour. I then ask what the speed will be answer: 70 MG/s minimum and up to 80. All sounded excellent so I agreed and give all the necessary details and received straight away email confirming the order and that the switch over will take effect on the 12th of December. few eek later a letter came from EE mentioning that they have been asked to stop the service from the 8th of December. Alarmed that i could potentially have no connection for 4 days I called BT  the only thing they could tell me was that the order will be completed on the 12th. (i never called EE until then  as BT was supposed to make all the necessary arrangement with EE). So i called EE and they confirm that the services will continue until the 12th. On he 12th of December I plg my new HUB and...NO connection. an engineer turns up (without me calling) to check if its all OK and find no fault other that the speed is 40mgs instead of 70mgs. I then call BT who told me that there is ""an open exception"" on the line and they can't provide the service. (they had already stopped the service I had with EE). After mucb discussion i was offered the option to go somewhere and buy a dongle for each of my computer  until the service resume supposedly 48 hours later?!?!?! 3 days later still no services  and now i am been told that I will have to wait another 4 days.... and as solution i should shop for dongles.~~~",lonond~~~,2016-12-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Would give them less than 1 star if possible - absolutely dreadful company  avoid them at all costs.  Engineers not showing up  clueless call centre workers who lie and fob you off  managers who never call you back and the audacity to charge you for line rental when it's been 7 weeks and you still have no phone line or internet connection.  This company are the worst and they do not deserve to receive any more support from paying customers.  Go with Sky or another company that seems to have a clue what they are doing.~~~,Northern Ireland~~~,2016-12-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Got a good reduced deal 18 months ago. A few dropouts recently that required an engineer to visit house. Service staff called several times to make sure everything had been fixed. Can't really fault the way I was treated. I did have a job understanding the regional accent of the caller -I would guess a strong Asian accent.My real bugbear is pricing  the moment the contract ended the price more than doubled to just under £40 pm and I never use the phone for calls. Searching around for a cheaper deal seems to throw you int the arms of the worst of the worst if the reviews are to be trusted. John Lewis  Origin  Tentel  all much cheaper but it seems all who are with them wish they weren't.So where do I go? Pay over and stay with BT or risk it!!! I think  I'll still have to search.~~~,Essex~~~,2016-12-15~~~,2,4,5,4
"If you like a massive language barrier  hearing outright lies from agents  going round in circles  waiting for up to 30 minutes listening to silence while they run ""tests""  speak to agents who know don't know how to use a BT Home Hub  and getting fobbed off with ""please wait 2 days while we monitor your connection"" then call BT broadband technical support now!  The Openreach guys are great but its so difficult to get an appointment booked with an engineer now (even if you offer to pay for it) that you are forced to endure the worst tech support service on the planet.  11 months and counting until I  switch to Zen.~~~",Berkshire~~~,2016-12-14~~~,1,1,3,1
THE WORSTThey might market themselves as the fastest broadband but signing BT was the worst mistake. We have had wifi cuts every single day and when we tried to file a complaint on BT website  it simply told us to check if the router was connected properly. After sending a very angry email we were finally contacted by their customer service. They asked us to test the connection with the cable which still did not help. Then they finally sent an engineer. After the engineer visited everything got even worse and we basically do not have any connection anymore.Hopefully this will solve eventually and I must say their customer service is very good  but it has been taking over a month now and we are all upset. I would really think twice before signing BT and in case you have problems  make them to send the engineer over right away  not waste time with some tests that do not help.~~~,Durham UK~~~,2016-12-14~~~,1,5,3,1
"Be AWARE !! After placing an order and have to wait for over 8 weeks before I got my parcel "" because apparently got lost in the post.."" Same problem happen to my neighbour.. Once we received it I had to wait over 2 weeks because of a problem on ""the area""  each time the engineer visited the flat I were told that the services would work soon.. nothing happen  next day called again and were told that a senior engineer would have to come to check the issue again  this happen 5 times  customer services have not a clue and miscommunication between wether the callcentre is located and the UK are none !!Stay Away !!~~~",London W2~~~,2016-12-14~~~,1,1,1,1
I was thinking of switching from BT  but only on cost grounds as I have only ever had good reliable service with a very helpful customer service backup. The speed here (rural  no fibre) varies from 5mbs to 8mbs  which is adequate for most things like viewing movies etc. Having seen some of the reviews here  I must be connected to a different BT!  The Post Office was my chosen replacement provider but they appear to be even worst  so I'm going to stick with the devil I know.~~~,Stroud~~~,2016-12-14~~~,4,4,3,4
Without doubt the worst company I have dealt with  the customer service telephone system is designed to make it difficult or impossible to get to speak to anyone and when you do get through to someone in some far flung country who you can hardly understand because of the lack of English  they are rude and have no customer service skills at all  clearly bt want to pay a minimum wage and ship out the call centres to foreign countries  trying to get a refund for the credit on my account was nightmare  seemed to me that they have been advised to tell you anything or lie in order to hold onto your money. Never never again will I deal with this company and can't wait for my contract to end. Advise anyone to stay well clear of British telecom. Disgusting.~~~,Farnborough~~~,2016-12-14~~~,1,1,1,2

It was good at first year. 24/7 good fluent and 2m/sec download speed. I guess it was because I was the first BT user in this building(I paid the line installation fee). Then at second year  the nightmare began. Instability all the time at random periods of day. Download speed was down to 1mb/sec. I guess BT just add another client so we have to share this line. Yet the staff just cannot do anything.~~~,sheffield uk~~~,2016-12-13~~~,2,1,1,1

Switched to BT phone connected 30 Nov. Still no sign of broadband 12 days later. Only spent 6 hours on the phone to their customer services over at least 12 calls  only problem they're still not providing me with a customer service. Still no sign of when or even if they can install broadband. Efficient.... Don't think they even deserve 1 star rating as I don't have a service to rate.

"Having gone to BT because of their Infinity deal a year ago (approx.) I have had numerous problems  an unhelpful  round in circles  conversations.Currently  I have spent over a month with a background ""crackle"" on the phone making conversation next to impossible  and my ""wonderful"" Hub cutting out and recycling (on 1 particular day from 11a.m. to 4.30p.m.).My suspicion is as follows;- On this estate  the cabling comes in underground (and the Fibre only comes to the distribution box  apparently}. Whenever we see an Openreach Technician doing something to the wiring in the compartment on the FOOTPATH outside our property (we assume adding another customer to INFINITY)when he/they leave we invariably have the problems. At this moment in time my Internet SEEMS okay  but the phone is still not right  and I wait with baited breath for another Openreach occurrence.~~~","Chedburgh, Bury St.Edmunds~~~",2016-12-12~~~,3,2,5,4

After chasing them up in was given a new date of 19th December  then 20th December and finally 23rd December.

So glad we're at the end of our 12 month contract. Been on BT infinity and it's the worst connection I've ever expierenced. It constantly drops and a lot of the time barely gets broadband speeds.

I waited out the 12 months and now I'm moving everything away from BT.~~~,Scotland~~~,2016-12-09~~~,1,1,1,1
After discussing about a better deal than the one that was offered online  I agreed to having fibre broadband on the deal that was discussed. The fibre was activated and I expected my bill to be what was discussed. However this was not the case and my bill was now £10 extra than expected. When I contacted BT over this issue  they denied all knowledge of me having any discussion over a better deal even though I have proof of this. They told me I could cancel my contract but it would cost me over £300 pounds.I can't help but feel mugged and ripped off!I should have stayed with SKY as they were faultless before!~~~,Worcestershire~~~,2016-12-09~~~,1,1,5,4
Okay  8 years with BT no problem. Really no problem. Decided to move and spoke to an operator who stated.....just plug in at your new address and we'll call you....no call. Called BT and spoke to a call centre.After getting through the menu I spoke to a male who stated i'll put you on hold a minute....another male came on the line and asked me the same questions the first guy did.What happened to the first guy I asked 'Sorry sir...I don't understand you' Then I was put on hold and disconnected.next call...disconnected after security q's.next call I spoke to a female who must have though I was quite stupid...is it plugged in??Okay sorted....after 30 mins on line.Then angrily called Customer Services.....cut off again. Next call to CS....'we don't have the facility to cut you off' ....yes you do! you keep doing it.Not sure if BT want my business or even care...disgusting behaviour and pure incompetence.~~~,Leicester~~~,2016-12-08~~~,1,1,1,1
where do i start  well i just moved to a new flat on the 7th nov 2016  i then thought i go with BT broadband which they gave a a date for the 28th nov 2016 that then got changed to the 29th nov  i still had no internet  so got in touch with BT they booked out a engineer for the 1st dec  great start this was as a new customer  engineer turned up he gone his checks sid it was a fault from the outside whick in my books was good because i won't get charged the £129. he come back and said that the engineer that done it done it from the wrong CAB address then he said the good news is  is that i've sorted the phone line which i 'm not bothered about but he said the bad news is you still haven't got inter net until the sort out the fibre in the right CAB  so went back on the phone to BT they said they get it sorted the next day which then got changed to the 6th of dec  guess what didn't have internet on that day so i got back in touch again with BT they said they changed the date to the 7th because they wanted to do a big fix in my area as more people was having the same problem and i will without fail have the internet by 8pm no later on that day guess what still no internet  the funny thing is was when i moved to this address the people b4 had talktalk i know this because by chance i pluged my router in and guess what  i had internet it was only 17mb down and less then 1mb up but i had internet  as someone thats wants to start streaming to twitch tv and youtube i need more upload speed BT at the time was a good offer  which so far is the only good thing i have seen in BT the offer would be twice as good if the internet was working.
