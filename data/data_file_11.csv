Useless.i got lied to when i set up my contract... the operator told me verbally 12 months they sent paperwork for 18th months( i didn't check my Fault) .... convenient they didn't record the call.constant drops in service with no explanation. changed my direct debit date from the 10th so i got 2 months worth of bank charges and damage to my credit file.called 4 times to set up paperless so i wasn't charged took them 6 months to get it done correct.there India complaints dept calls and there accent is that thick you cant understand AVOID BT.~~~,Coventry~~~,2019-04-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Internet kepts cutting around 30-40 times in a day  as a gamer you can’t rely on it to play a single game without worrying about it being cut mid-session. Tried calling them about it and they said they cut it and also slowed my internet down because of “excessive usage” (downloading files  in my case it was a single ps4 game mandatory UPDATE from the legal market where every player has to update their game) on a contract that says “unlimited internet”. All i have done is watch YouTube video and amazon prime.~~~,Kingston upon thames~~~,2019-04-09~~~,1,1,1,1
Why is my broadband speed 0.9 mbps!!! what a rip-off  no wonder the Netflix drops out after 10 minutes!! and has done for over a year!! you should be ashamed of yourselves  forcing people to upgrade  to watch a programme.~~~,BT403TR~~~,2019-04-08~~~,1,1,1,1
worst providers I have come across EVER !!!! we have the same trouble every month and every time we think it's sorted that crop back up. The internet is shocking and we end up having to use 4g on mobiles most of the month. The bill is an absolute nightmare ! we phone to pay every month and ask them to change the date of the direct debit  they have always said it's done and we have the same problem the month after and then we have to pay late charges. this month is the first time we have been told that the direct debit can not be changed and they have no recorded of us being told we can change it. staff can be rude and the last conversation I had I told the lady I was thinking of leaving and she hung up on me.~~~,Shirley ~~~,2019-04-08~~~,1,1,1,1
The service from bt is terrible I have boasters in every room in the house. I am sat less than a metre from a boaster and every few seconds it disconnects. This has to be the worst internet provider. Funnily enough this has only just been happening since they put the offer of paying so much a month to guarantee connection in every room. This looks like a money making scam to me~~~,kingshurst~~~,2019-04-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Don't know why I bothered to change my contract to them after the horrendous situation with the Internet. The Internet installation got delayed by 3 weeks  2 missed appointments and a general lack of knowledge throughout the call centre. Decided to get a BT sim only through temptation of free BT Sports and a cheaper plan. You have to call to activate BT Sport  why someone can't do it via chat I have no idea so  a 15 minute hold later  asked for DPA  gave my details  asked to hold for a minute while my account gets pulled up and the phone gets put down  no call back. Get back on to chat to be told the adviser will call me and connect me with that team to receive a call and be told they've closed. Absolutely outstanding customer service.~~~,Manchester~~~,2019-04-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely atrocious - sent hub to the wrong place 5 times  cancelled engineer visits automatically  different teams had a diffferent view of the same problem  4 people on the same day confirmed an engineering visit until the 5th saw the service provider (open reach engineer) had rejected the fault problem and the engineer never showed. POS (and that doesn’t stand for point of sale). Terrible  the worst.~~~,London~~~,2019-04-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Completely unacceptable company. They said they will send engineers and they said that 10 times and never came!  They made no effort to fix the service and they do not care about their customers at all. Do not choose BT.~~~,London~~~,2019-03-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Amazing reliability  even better customer service then Sky Virgin and Talk Talk. Totally recommend BT especially Their new BT smart hub 2!!!!~~~,Watkinson~~~,2019-03-26~~~,5,5,5,5
BT have been useless from start to finish. Firstly  their records were incorrect so we waited 2 weeks for fibre to be activated  only to be told its not available (it is  I can see the exchange from my house!). After a 2 week investigation they realised it was available  and said I could upgrade over the phone and receive their offers of £120 gift card  and an amazon echo - not too bad I thought. After waiting two weeks  was told that I need to wait a couple more days until I'm outside the cooling off period. Lo and behold  then I'm told i'm not eligible because I didn't upgrade through their website (which was impossible  because their records were wrong). Despite confirming with 4 different members of staff (and counting) at BT that I would receive this  the rewards team still tell me I'm not eligible. The customer service at BT is shocking - the teams cannot speak to each other  and the live chat function is 95% automated  and 5% requires a translator so equally useless. Don't bother with them! Talktalk  Vodafone  and Virgin offer the same for much less - lesson learned.~~~,Herefordshire~~~,2019-03-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Had Fibre Broadband since 2011. BT Infinity was my first taste of superfast broadband back then. In the last 8 years have tried Sky  TalkTalk and PlusNet but back with BT since 2017 and will stick with them as had numerous troubles with all the others. For me BT has proved very reliable with 99.999% up time and great speeds. The one time my router failed they replaced within 48hrs  and when the line from my house to telephone pole had an issue they had OpenReach out to fix within 12hrs  on a bank holiday weekend! My internet connection is essential to my life  BT not the cheapest but so far have easily proved the most reliable. Came on here as my BT contract was up and wanted to check out ratings for some alternative providers who were offering some amazing deals. However weighing everything up I think I'll pay the extra and stick with BT as (in my area at least) they're delivering a pretty solid service. NB - I have SuperFast Fibre 1 and get 67MB/Down and 18MB/Up which is well above the advertised speeds so very happy with that and more than enough for my needs  even with 5 smart TV's in the house!~~~,London~~~,2019-03-16~~~,5,4,5,5
The worst company I have ever used to provide me with any service  EVER.Avoid BT. Wish I stayed with Sky.~~~,Bridgend~~~,2019-03-16~~~,1,1,2,1
"Wishing is read some reviews before changing my broadband provider.  My change was supposed to happen yesterday.  I had an email the day before from BT saying this could take upto 11.50pm and they would contact me once the service was available.  Still not working when I went to bed last night.  This morning my old talk talk broadband is no longer working quite rightly  no message from BT   still no BT internet my computer gave me a number to call BT which I did   told the phone system what the problem was and my phone number..... waited......'we're sorry or offices are now closed"" so thru didn't think to have that message at the start of the call then~~~",Leicestershire ~~~,2019-03-16~~~,1,1,1,1

Do not go near this company unless you want frustration after frustration. spent 1 hour 30mins on phone last week making an appointment. Guess what they never turned up or sent the router out. Now i'm another hour into chat trying to make another appointment. Do not use this company. I have never in my whole life experienced such incompetence. Do not go there. Do not consider giving them any of your money.~~~,Keighley~~~,2019-03-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I live in a two bedroom flat in central London and BT's internet service was so poor that I could not use services like Netflix  Amazon Prime or Youtube. The wifi signal was too weak and even using basic internet services  like online banking  was unbelievably slow. In my experience  BT's internet/wifi service is useless. I spent 3 months talking to BT customer service representatives trying to resolve the issue. Nothing BT suggested improved the situation so after 3 months  I joined another internet provider. BT then informed me that I would be charged £225 for breaking their contract early. In my opinion  BT should have refunded me for the months I paid them but didn't receive a useable service. BT: Terrible internet service. Outrageous customer service. Avoid BT. There are better service providers out there. I will never use BT again.~~~,London~~~,2019-03-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Advertised as minimum 65Mbps download speed.  Lucky if I get 55; mostly 40-50 in the evenings when most people including myself wish to use it.  Not good enough really.  20% incidence of signal lost during viewing films etc.  Very inconvenient.  I have tried everything I know (BT speed booster  router next to computer and TV; no additional user in house)make no difference. BT Customer services claim that there is no broadband fault and that my speed is maximal.  Not so. Will be looking elsewhere!~~~,Frimley~~~,2019-03-11~~~,3,3,3,4

Moved back to BT in December 2018  as they had just installed a new five cabinet at the end of my road.Bought the ‘super fast fibre BB’ package on the assumption I’d be fed from the new cabinet!!Oh no...... they’ve left me on an old cabinet routing that in 4.1km of twisted copper pair  so I fluctuate between 1.6 and 3.7mb.They won’t re-route me as it is an engineering expense to them  and I fall into he ‘superfast fibre’ category between 2-5mb.....crap!Not happy does not cover my experience!!!~~~,"Spencer Place Farm, Sandy Lane, Waltham Chase~~~",2019-03-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Just been on the phone 50 minutes to make an appointment for a follow up appointment due to broadband not working. Ridiculous still not any nearer. Now 15 minutes into BT online chat - it's a joke. Stay clear of BT - do not use them unless you want to be put on hold where you can hear all the staff laughing in background and nothing getting done~~~,Keighley~~~,2019-03-05~~~,1,1,1,1
"Ripping off the country. Am I the only person that can see this?..  In 1996 CableTel dug up 90% of the streets in the UK to install fibre optic cables. CableTel was soon to become NTL in 1998. 2002 I moved into my new property. NTL we're offering fibre optic broadband where you had to have a BT line to subscribe. I took up the offer which was giving 16mps download speeds runnining 2 PC's which is faster than I have on BT's ADSL standard in my recent new property. BT phoned me to upgrade but declined. After declining  my broadband sped has dropped. We could use 2 gaming consoles  a laptop and phones the same time no problem. I rang them up to complain about this and told me that I'm on the old copper cable.. I pissed myself laughing asking ""What copper cable?"" Virgin and Telewest took over NTL contracts  you can't get Virgin without a BT line  so BT have owned the cables since NTL went bankrupt. I told him on the phone that if he could prove to me that they can supply the whole country with broadband through a copper line at speeds of 10 to 18mbs then I will take up the offer  as I know that broadband has always been FibreOptic  otherwise we'd be on dial up. It's a massive con and we are letting them get away with it.~~~",Neath~~~,2019-03-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Unexpected  amazing service. I spoke with Michael  form the case management in Liverpool (that wat it says on the text send to me within an hour of my conversation which was at 8.20 pm!)  who was amazing and went above and beyond of my expectations. Usually  I am not happy with BT  but on this occasion  Michael sorted out everting within an hour (I was expecting to wait about two weeks and to make a few more calls  as usual). If BT had more agents like Michael  I would definitely consider moving my mobile service and my cable TV to them. Thank you Michael ~~~,Banbury~~~,2019-03-03~~~,5,5,4,5
Our WiFi hasn’t been working for 3 weeks because they wired it wrong and they keep saying they’ll send someone to fix it and just keep delaying over and over. Absolute joke really~~~,England ~~~,2019-03-01~~~,1,1,1,1
The cost of the service is too much. You don’t get any offers. If you are struggling for your contract payment and need to downgrade  this isn’t possible. I am cancelling as soon as my contract runs out. If I could do now I would. So Do think twice before choosing them.~~~,Swindon ~~~,2019-03-01~~~,1,3,5,5
Honest review - broadband is really good (5/5)  customer service is ok - bur pretty slow sometimes on online chats (4/5). BT rewards - good idea to introduce these but 2 months passed and still waiting for my  card to be sent - have contacted them several times already  lets see if I will ever receive it (2/5). Also i didn’t really like that I have been charged for 2 weeks from ordering to installation (1/5) - either installation time should be reduced or they should charge for the broadband from the day that it is actually installed. Overall  pretty impressed with broadband but they should manage other things better.~~~,London~~~,2019-02-27~~~,2,4,5,5
Never had a problem with my package. Fast connection  reasonable price and they have given me amazing customer service every single time.~~~,South Lanarkshire.~~~,2019-02-27~~~,5,5,5,5
Terrible. 3 weeks into contract we haven't been connected to the internet yet. They promised an engineer will come 3 times but no one came. Customer service lies as what happened today. Avoid BT. Worse service ever.Lost a lot of time and days waiting for an engineer which never came. Failed promises over and over again.~~~,Eastbourne~~~,2019-02-26~~~,1,1,~~~,1
Very unreliable company.Very incompetent customer service and LIARS! After numerous phone calls and their failed promises 3 weeks later they have not fixed our broadband yet. They will twist things and make it your fault.  Not worth it. Avoid BT. From very unsatisfied customers.~~~,Eastbourne~~~,2019-02-26~~~,1,1,1,1
"Having spent a great deal of time ""chatting"" to BT persons on a few occasions  I am still not receiving the super fast 2 broadband speed which I am paying for.  I am not sure which way to turn now as when I moved house 10 years ago  I was torn between BT and another company I was with to getting a working landline and broadband in the new home...it cost me time  more money and considerable stress.

Would have given 0 stars.Had an order placed by them and they put me on infinity 2 despite only being able to get a maximum speed of 21mbps at an extortionate price which subsequently put me in a new contract. On a good day the best speed achieved is 11mbps and that was at silly o'clock in the morning. Constant buffering  umpteen faults on the line resulting in being unable to make calls or go online. Having extra services added that were not wanted or requested and then having a battle to get them removed. Passed from pilla to post with no one taking responsibility or ownership. Will no doubt need to take the issues to ADR and ombudsman.The TV package isn't worth the cost  now tv and Netflix combined are better value for money.My advice is to get service from a more reliable company that has great customer service~~~,Lancaster~~~,2019-02-18~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Dreadful from start to finish  countless problems trying to setup in multiple housesThe Call centres they provide are next to useless  their english language skills are awful and their technical skills and knowledge even worse. Had BT broadband in 4 different properties and its been intermittent and dropped out all the time and never been the speed quoted. Overprived and you can find much better deals out there now.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2019-02-14~~~,1,1,2,1
Absolutely **** internet and rip off price. Waited until end of contact just paid 48 pounds plus some made up early exit fee 5.13 even though the contract ended in Feb 2019 and they cut me offline after 4 days. So why the hell I just paid 48£ for 4 days????. First and last time I'm with those *****~~~,London~~~,2019-02-11~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

In my (long) experience of BT I can say that BT provides an appalling broadband service. Although the exchange is across the road from my house the download speed is now only 0.23 Mbps which makes broadband almost unusable. (There seems to be some continual problem at the exchange). Yet I am told that this is an acceptable speed! I am paying £55 a month for this service plus phone calls.~~~,Fort William~~~,2019-02-04~~~,1,1,1,3
no stars for BT. Mind bendingly awful in every way. We have been battling to get our phone line to work for 5 years and the internet also which operates spasmodically so you can't get a refund. Each time we are fobbed off with the 'it isn't us its Open Reach' excuse. If you are lucky enough to get an Open Reach engineer to actually come at the time stated they say 'not us mate problem is with  BT.' We are in a rural area with the new SUBSIDISED Rural Fibre option supplied to outside our gate but we are still being fobbed off and passed from department to department with no one taking ownership of the incompetence.~~~,IP18 6SJ~~~,2019-02-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Been without Internet for a week  Even though BT promised to have it sorted on 3 different occasions  today Open Reach tell me it will be out for upto a month. BT's response is to pass me from pillar to post  ending up with Paul from Cardiff. He read continually from his notes and kept going on mute to write more notes saying the same thing !!! To be honest an absolute disgrace  I've been with then for 20 odd years and they are happy for me to be without Internet for a month but won't let me cancel my contract - that's how to keep customers - what a service !! - appalling from top to bottom~~~,Abo~~~,2019-01-31~~~,1,1,1,1
