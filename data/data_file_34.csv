Absolutely atrocious and abysmal service. Please for the love of God go somewhere else. Reliability non existent. I'm paying for 70mb broadband and get 2mb speeds over the wifi at about 20 feet away. DISGUSTINGLY BAD~~~,Glasgow~~~,2017-04-23~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Everything bad previously said is true. The only way is to e-mail the Chief Exec Gavin Patterson and you will be contacted by an Executive complaints handler who will then be your dedicated contact and point of reference. He will(should) be able to move things apace. Except when he gets your broadband onto Fast Fibre but your speed falls from 1.5mbs to 0.5 mbs !!! To far from closest 'BOX' Ah well.~~~,ludlow shropshire~~~,2017-04-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Do you really want one?  Diabolical.  I am now on my 2nd infinity hub.  I player took 48 minutes to play 28 on BBC. Wish I had changed.  Nothing good to say.  Just want my money back and soon.~~~,Dartford~~~,2017-04-21~~~,1,2,1,1
BT ARE ABSOLUTE RUBBISH !!!!!  DONT SWITCH TO THEM !!!!  I was contacted by BT who convinced me to change back to they're services saying that my poor internet speeds etc was due to sky being a bad provider. Yet since I've been with these absolute fools I have had approximately 2 weeks of internet and phone line in the 5 months I've been with them.  They have provided me with ENGINEERS THAT DONT TURN UP !! And excuses that do t wash.   DONT DO IT PLEASE STAY WITH YOUR CURRENT PROVIDER !!!!~~~,Stoke Gifford / Bristol~~~,2017-04-21~~~,1,1,1,1
A lot of bad reviews on here!   BT are amazing I am in the best speeds I have ever had~~~,Scotland~~~,2017-04-19~~~,5,5,5,5
Very poor speeds regularly choked lucky to get 2mb overall.Customer service is very disapointing + unreliable.~~~,berwickshire~~~,2017-04-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Appalling speeds  rarely matches the guaranteed minimum. Wi-Fi struggles with 2 metres  often with Wi-Fi and Ethernet connections showing as 'unstable'. Hate it and the 'holier than thou' attitude of staff. Will be leaving this shambolic company and contract as soon as possible.~~~,Leeds~~~,2017-04-16~~~,1,3,1,1
Worst broadband provider I've ever had the misfortune to deal with - do not switch to BT at any cost.  BT couldn't set my line up correctly  took them two weeks.  Their customer service is abysmal  prepare to get bounced around multiple call centres being lied to  customer service agents continually contradict each other and you have to repeat your problem to a half dozen people before you find someone who can help.  Broadband speed is shocking  my BT Infinity is slower than my standard Sky speeds  the router frequently resets itself  usually during the middle of a film.  My TV box is also broken so I cannot receive paid-for channels  today I was promised a call back with a resolution.  After 6 hours of waiting I called them back myself only to be told an engineer would need to come out but I would need to wait a week for this and it would also cost me £130 if they could not find the fault (essentially blaming me  the customer).  Bunch of absolute cowboys  I expected so much more from BT.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2017-04-15~~~,1,1,1,2
I have been a BT customer for over 5 years  recently when I wanted to move to another network provider  there has been lots and lots of issues with BT mainly because they wanted to keep me as a customer. I have received a charge from BT of £550 as a result of me moving to another provider  when I have received this notice  I decided to phone BT and after a chat with an agent I decided that I no longer wanted to move to another provider as a result of the charges. Therefore the BT agent was meant to put what is called a slam on the line but that never happened  the new network provider had no evidence of this happening. Thankfully I have now managed to win this case and move to the other provider with no charges at all. That just shows that it is always worth to fight for your own   no matter how stressful it can become.~~~,Kirkcudbright~~~,2017-04-15~~~,1,1,3,3
Just been informed by BT's Mark that they don't guarantee BT wifi in your own home... really shocking. Every now and then BT wifi get disconnected.  No help available from BT.Another individual can't differentiate between account number and land line number. What kind of service can u imagine ?~~~,Wembley~~~,2017-04-15~~~,1,1,1,1
No issues it has rarely if ever gone down and speeds of up to 40 meg~~~,Grange Park Swindon~~~,2017-04-15~~~,4,5,3,5
Like many rural users BT doesn't really want to know about our problems.  Faults take far too long to get fixed  if they ever do and there seems to be no urgency to address the problem of abysmally slow speeds.~~~,Orkney~~~,2017-04-14~~~,3,2,1,2
I am very happy with my broadband from BT. I have never had any trouble at all and I have been with them for 7 and a half years now!~~~,Scotland ~~~,2017-04-14~~~,5,5,5,5
Min speed of 64meg and I live in a village not a town.  Very impressed with customer contact centre help (UK  India and I think Phillipnes). One Openreach engineer visit who resolved all my internal wiring problems.  Line speed went up from 29megs and is rock solid at 64megs two months later.~~~,Herefordshire ~~~,2017-04-14~~~,5,5,5,5
I pay for fibre optic broadband and receive speeds too low to download films from Netflix. Supposedly I get up to 44Mbps which should be plenty. Have had numerous calls to BT who either don't believe me or just don't care. Speed goes up and down like the proverbial yoyo.~~~,West yorkshire~~~,2017-04-14~~~,1,1,1,1
How does bt even exist!!Signed up about four weeks ago..Broadband and telephone working ok even though they sent me two routers....Waited an extra few days for tbe tv box but did not appear...I then made call after call to bt to find out where the item was only to find that tbey had cancelled it without even telling me...USELESS!!Then again after several calls bouncing from one advisor in the uk to several overseas advisors who had may aswell spoken in german....told me they would cancel down the subscribtion and start over...After afew more days the unit came...i have spent over fours ours this morning speaking to technical teams that speak some other language to me and have now told me that i have to wait another four days before they can fix it...You can guess what i did after that...Yep....cancelled everything!!Please pleass do NOT sign up to bt....Their customer service is exactly as bad as everybody says...Virgin Media and BT are most definatly the worst ever providers..sky following close behind....~~~,Hampshire~~~,2017-04-14~~~,1,1,3,3
I've been repeatedly lied to by BT staff over the past ten days. Internet keeps dropping and is extremely slow. Had four so called engineers out in the last few months to try to fix the problem  but still not working reliably. Took a day off work to stay in for engineer  and told he would be there between 08.00-13.00. called them at 12.00 as had not received the usual text of call to say they were en route to be told the appointment had been cancelled and made for Thursday  although I had told them that was not suitable. Promised return calls were never received. Got home on Thursday to find a card put through the door saying he had called round anyway!!! Many calls to them and many Livechats later  speaking to at least twenty people and having to explain the issue many times  I was finally told they would come out on Saturday the 18th to fix the issue. Checked my diary after ending the call to see that the 18th is Tuesday. Another call to be told he could not find the promised  appointment. Another live chat today to be told they are booked to come out on Sunday the 16th. I'm not confident the promised appointment will be kept  and if not  I'm going to have to cancel the service and do without an internet service altogether  as no service is better than an extremely poor service. Too stressful to deal with  and staff with a very poor grasp of English  and would NEVER recommend BT.~~~,Leven~~~,2017-04-14~~~,1,1,1,1
I entered into an agreement with BT many many years ago and the last time I looked (a couple of years ago) I was paying around 15-ish pounds plus line rental  so it was probably costing around £25 pm. My loyalty has been rewarded by BT by unilaterally racking up my monthly charges up to £47.  For that I get 0.5mb (I did you not) download speeds  mediocre service  regular breakdowns and a number of 'services' I never use.  for £47 I can get broadband  a decent TV package  line rental  free SIM card and cash back so goodbye BT. Congratulations- your subterfuge  greed and disingenuity has led me to cancel my agreement with BT and move to a competitor.  I do not expect the customer service will be any better  but at least I can either halve the charges or benefit from some major benefits such as  for example  a TV box and/or movie package.~~~,Bristol~~~,2017-04-14~~~,1,2,1,3
Bt isamsung my worst nightmare. I am so sad to be dealing with them. Everyone be careful and read the reviews. I wish I had read them before I took out this contract~~~,Tiverton~~~,2017-04-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Bt tv new set up. Who thought this new way of using bt tv was better. It's rubbish. You can't see information as it's put up over last program watched. It's defiantly !!!! Not easy to use. Having done survey regarding all aspects of bt tv I think it's taken a backwards step.~~~,Cardiff~~~,2017-04-13~~~,3,2,3,3
What an awful experience  moved to a new build with BT as the only provider. I had no choice to switch from Virgin super fast broadband and great customer service to over 6 weeks wait for a phone line and cancelled broadband orders. I have such low expectations I am waiting another 3 weeks before complaining again. Never go for BT~~~,Birmingham ~~~,2017-04-12~~~,1,1,1,1
I've been with BT since December 2012. It took them 7 whole months to finally spot and fix the problem with a brand new line. Crackling noises in the voice line  intermittent disconnection in the internet line. Since 2013 I had to move house twice and obviously had to transfer the service. The whole transition was just a nightmare with the customer service being the worst by far in the planet! Lately  I requested the existing line to be transferred from my wife's name to mine. They treated that as a new account  had to cancel the existing services  reactivate them under my name. How stupid that is? And on top of that  they gave me a new phone number; they never have told me that is was part of the procedure (although it was supposed to be just an account holder change) and had to request renumbering after the new phone line activation. That task is supposed to have been completed within 24 hours. 9 days later and 4 live chats with CS  renumbering has not been completed yet. Conclusively  the service from the technical side of view  once set up correctly by their side  it works fine. But that could take ages with a customer support like this!!!~~~,Essex~~~,2017-04-12~~~,2,1,5,4
"I can't believe this company exists  totally incompetent of communication both between departments and with the customer.

I wish I'd read these reviews before switching. We've had the contract 8 months now and the internet has never worked properly. It cuts out at least 10 times a day  it just drops out for no reason. It's meant I can't rely on working at home  we can't watch netflix in the evening  or anything internet related. I've called repeatedly and been told unhelpful tips (like that the only way they can guarantee a good connection is if we plug into an ethernet cable. In 2017 you're telling me you can't provide WIFI???????? )  or have said they've fixed it when they haven't.  We will definitely be switching as soon as our contract is up. Never go with these guys.~~~,South East London~~~,2017-04-11~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is the worst internet provider by far. The speed is very poor  price is astronomical  customer service is non-existent. I repeatedly asked for unlimited broadband which was not put into place resulting in huge bills. Do not use BT. It is a complete rip off & they over-charge unsuspecting customers. They had agreed to compensate me for over-charging me but I did not receive the refund and then they said they would not honour the agreement. Good old British Telecom!~~~,Buckinghamshire~~~,2017-04-10~~~,1,1,1,1
"Just had to renew contract with BT.  My old bt 3 hub is giving trouble . BT agree it is faulty  it works for a while then just goes dead.  Reboot and its ok for a while. Bt won't change it saying it is out of warranty although they still accept full payment each month. So I must enter a new contract. Where I live the only other gang are those that can""t speak decent English  not even their sales team.  So I'm stuck with BT !After much time spent on the Phone a new package was agreed  confirmed twice verbally  even confirmed it was being recorded  then confirmed by email and low and behold Bt had changed the deal.  Back on the phone. No I can't have that deal  it was wrong what the salesman told me  It now costs £8.99 more. BT claim they can back out of their agreement in the first 14 days.  Like I said I'm stuck with them. Won't send another Hub lest I go through all those hours of convincing them it faulty after my new contract starts tomorrow. At least they speak English even if it is with ""forked tongue""~~~",South Wales~~~,2017-04-10~~~,2,2,1,1
I Cannot believe how bad this company is. I came to this country not knwoing much about the competition but speaking to BT  they gave me all the possible good vibes about using them and i signed up with them. in my first year  I was horrified and terrified by the bills and their AWFUL AND DIABOLICAL customer service. every single call that I have made to this company was over an hour  wasting my time and at the end of the call  you feel brain dead because the customer service people twist their words and statements so much. I would recommend NOT TO USE THEM WHAT SO EVER. i can go ON AND ON about them but I can't be bothered to waste any more of my time and Google's space for reviews.~~~,South London~~~,2017-04-10~~~,1,1,2,3

Below I have listed all the points and issues that have arisen since the 29/11/2016.•Phone call made to BT on the 29/11/17 to explain we needed to move our business•I was passed to 3 different departments in which I had to explain in full each time•I was told someone would be in touch regarding the order (BTAARP061-1)...this didn’t happen•I made various call again having to explain what I needed  I was told the wrong service and equipment had been ordered but a project manager would contact me to handle the full move•Mr X from the business movers service team phoned and told me he had been assigned to look after the move and also comply with the “best practice steps 1-5” (if you need it I have an email listing the steps •The first thing he did was cancel the previous order as it was all wrong  I had an email on the 08/12/16 confirming this had been cancelled  the new provisionally appointed work to be carried out date was 19/12/16.•I was told someone from BT cloud phone would be in touch to progress with the order•MR Y emailed me and I quote “I have now been informed that the order that sales had placed for BT cloud phone was incorrect and should have been for another BT product  cloud voice” as you can imagine alarm bells had started. “ I do apologise on behalf of the company for these problems  but trust that this will now be resolved by sales in conjunction with the BT movers team and the Cloud voice team”•I never heard from MR Y again•I received an email on the 09/12/16 from MR X stating order BTAARP06 was now complete and hoped I was happy with the service? This order had been cancelled and was never completed.•A new project manager had now taken over MR Z  he contacted me over the phone and said he had arranged for MISS D to meet Myself and the other director onsite to start the full order process again as it was proving impossible to arrange over the phone•On the 12/12/16 MISS D attended our new property at 13.30pm•We explained the shambles that had happened previous and stressed the point over and over again that we needed someone to take full charge of the order and arrange everything without us having to make constant calls and do all the chasing  our business depended on it•MISS D told myself and my partner that we didn’t have anything to worry about  she would arrange everything and the process would be very smooth  our full system could take up to a max of 60-90 days however she would arrange a temporary solution that would enable us to move into the new premises early January 2017. She also expressed her apologies for the way the move had been dealt with to date.•In MISS D proposal email I quote the following paragraph “I would like to highlight the strengths BT has to offer you. We have involved in the installation and commissioning of similar projects for many years and have an unmatched record of professionalism. Our local engineering team will endeavour to complete your installation with minimum inconvenience  as we understand the need for continuity in business•If this paragraph had been adhered to I would not be writing this complaint•Engineer booked for 19th of Dec  ORDER NUMBER xxxxxxxx•Email on the 18th Dec stating work to order number above had been completed-work had not even started•Engineer cancelled on the 19th rebooked for the 23rd of Dec•Our works Christmas function was due to take place on the 22nd of Dec 60 miles away from my office•I didn’t attend Christmas function so I was able to meet the engineer the following morning•Engineer arrived on the 23rd and said he wasn’t sure what the job was he was supposed to be doing  I tried contacting MISS D but to no avail  he contacted his department who then confirmed the job couldn’t be done as the line was coming from the wrong exchange  engineer left and said job would be rebooked.•I was then sent a fine of £130 plus VAT because apparently I didn’t meet the engineer on the 23rd of Dec•Work was then booked for the 9th of Jan  when I called to confirm this I was told the case was unassigned and no engineer was booked in  I was also told I was waiting on a call from another project manager •The new project manager was MISS L who I explained everything to and also sent the conversations that had taken place with MISS D  Again I was assured everything would be taken care of and I had nothing to worry about•At this point various text messages had been sent to MISS D with no reply  I have attached the messages as proof•Engineer arrived on Tuesday the 10th of Jan  exactly the same thing happened. Wrong exchange and no one could explain what was going on. Again the job had to be rebooked with open reach  open reach blamed BT and vice versa.•I have emails from MISS L assuring me open reach had sorted the issue with the exchange and 100% the engineer will be able to install the temp line on the next visit•Engineer booked for the 13th  this was then cancelled by either BT or open reach and re scheduled for Monday the 16th •GUESS WHAT?.....wrong exchange again! We have a voice recording of exactly what the engineer said and admitted the job was a complete mess! Please let me know if you wish me to send this to you.•At this point MISS D had not been in touch•Engineer booked in again for the 19th of Jan  finally after 4 attempts the temp line was installed•Another project manager then called me stating she was taking over to assure things ran smoothly from this point on her name was MISS P....I explained everything again in full and reduced myself to tears on the phone pleading with her to make sure it happens  she stating she was going to look into everything for me and call me in 2 days time to update me on the full project  she couldn’t have been more sincere. Is this something BT do as part of their training? A course in how to become a pathological liar?•I never heard from MISS P again.............•I asked MISS L to contact MISS P for me and ask her to get in touch  nothing ever came of this•Engineer booked for the 20th of Jan to install the broad band I have an email from MISS L stating the engineer will visit between 13.00-18.00pm  I cleared my diary and waited at the office from 13.00 – 1600pm  I contacted MISS L as I would have usually had a call or email from open reach confirming the job. MISS L told me the work had been already completed offsite at 10.30am that morning. When I said I have been waiting all day her response was “it’s not uncommon for customers not to be informed” so this was yet another business day wasted waiting around for BT•24 January the case was moved across to MR M  I had a phone call with him and MISS D was in the background so she could hear the conversation  he again apologised for the issues we had faced so far. He listed points of the project for the next stages.•PSTN installation for the 25/01 was booked in as we had received email confirmation = MR M said he could not find that on the system but would look into it. The installation didn’t happen on the 25th but 2 weeks after this date.•Project Manager to the lease line order was MR J = the only person other than MR M who has kept to his promises•MR J sent the equipment for the system i.e phones and switch•Engineer booked to come and install the equipment 16th of Feb  engineers words “sorry love I’m snookered I can’t do this job” it turns out vital equipment was missing of original order the firewall and sisco router. Engineer spoke to MISS D on the phone and explained the problem  MISS D said she would look into it•MR J contacted me and said we could install the phones ourselves if we wanted to take the risk without the firewall  because we were running out of time we agreed and spent the rest of the day doing the job the engineer didn’t•I spoke to MR M ref to the equipment that had been missed and yet again delayed the job by a further week  he arranged for MISS D and his IT man to come to my office and install the firewall and we wouldn’t be charged•The sisco router was sent by post to us and an engineer was arranged to come and fit it on the 10th of Feb •The company who came to do the CAT 5 cables arrived on the 9th of Feb  the man who came stated he couldn’t do the job as BT had only put the job down as 1 man when actually it should have been a 2 man job  I literally had to beg and thankfully he did the job and completed it on the 10th of Feb•Engineer arrived on the 10th to fit the sisco router and stated the cabinet that was ordered was to small and it wouldn’t fit inside so it is currently on the floor. Please see attached photo evidence of the system and the way it has been installed and left•I have requested the correct cabinet but I am still waiting on the outcome•Our phone system is still not running correctly and one of the cloud phones doesn’t work at all  we are waiting on a replacement to be sent•We are now 101 days in since I first contacted BT to move my business and we are still not 100% up and runningThere is more that could be added to this complaint but because I am unsure of dates I haven’t included them  however I can assure you hours of valuable time have been spent on the phone achieving absolutely nothing and going round in circles. I have been running a sales business for 8 years and I have never come across anything like this  the incompetence of the sales staff is astounding and frankly if they worked for me and treated my valuable customers in the same way they wouldn’t last 5 minutes.As you can see  your company has let Mobility Connect LTD down in every way imaginable. It has caused unbelievable stress on the business at a time when we should be enjoying the growth of the company and moving to new premises  instead we are stressing over BT’S incompetence. 1 STAR IS VERY GENEROUS!!!!!!~~~,Morecambe~~~,2017-04-04~~~,1,1,1,1
I've been with BT for years but have only recently taken over paying the bill.  I got a fairly decent deal last year and the service was reliable to after some too-ing and fro-ing between them and Virgin  I decided to stay put as I rely heavily in the internet to work from home and I didn't want my internet to be restricted. So they offered my an ok deal for Infinity 1 - more than I had but as I couldn't previously watch films on normal broadband  thought it might be worth the upgrade.  So.... the internet is Worse  Cuts out or just drops off at least once a week.  Wifi sometimes default to the free public BT-Fon internet as that signal is actually Stronger.  Complained once and the guy said he would reset/clear something or other and it got a little better  but now I do a speed check once every few weeks and its nothing like I was promised.   To top it all off I have noticed on my bill that they are taking £60 a month from my account instead of the £30 on my contract.  And to reduce that £30 even more I paid £205 line rental upfront.  So not only did they take the upfront line rental - which meant I should only be paying about £13.50 a month now they are taking £60 a month. That's a monthly overcharge of £45. They are taking more money than I have authorised and are also double charging me. I feel robbed and definitely wont trust BT again.  BEWARE!~~~,Norwich~~~,2017-04-03~~~,~~~,2,2,2
The broadband is so slow it can take hours to download anything as at times it looses its connection.It looses connection on speed tests. Im living on a new housing development and yet most of it cannot even get a decent broadband speed  it seems that BT do not care about their customers  they seem more interested in how much profit they can make.~~~,Bridgwater~~~,2017-04-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Only company I know of that believes it is accepfable to tell you that you won't be charged a call out fee on 3 separate occasions  and then charge it to your bill anway and take it fom your account without your authority. Staff who lie and are apparently trained not to listen to reason and who have not an ounce of client centricity in their bones. A shambolic organisation that it's Chairman and CEO should be ashamed of (but who I suspect are more interested in their over inflated financial incentives than any of their customer experiences). Avoid at all costs unless you want a coronary trying to get back your hard earned cash that they have taken from your account without authority.~~~,East Midlands~~~,2017-04-02~~~,1,1,1,1
