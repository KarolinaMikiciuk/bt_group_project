I cannot put into words how bad BT are. I can safely say that they are the WORSE company i have ever had the misfortune of dealing with.There staff are poorly informed poorly trained and they even cut me off when they couldn't sort the issues. I swapped to a business line as they told me i would get a better broadband connection.. only thing thing they are good at is billing you. They swapped my line to business and kept billing me for residential too. 10 months being charged double.. This company needs a serious overall. If i could put a minus score i would. If anyone out there could avoid using BT i would higly recommend it. Complete utter wasters. Service rubbish customer service rubbish.~~~,Church fenton~~~,2018-10-02~~~,1,1,1,1
If I could put no stars I would. Ive just never been through something like this in 2018 I cant get the speed higher than 2mbs and I've called them 5 times to try and sort it and apparently the fault has never gone through. They're totally unreliable. Im paying 45 gbp a month for practically no internet and no one has managed to successfully put my fault through to open reach. An absolute incompetent provider. I wish I could move!~~~,London~~~,2018-10-02~~~,1,1,1,1
As soon as the contract is over with BT I will never ever use them again for anything at all.  Can not say enough about how f****** awful they are.  Broadband speed is okay but reliability is beyond a joke!!! I had better connections when you used to have to dial your phone line to get connected to Internet.  I cannot stress enough to everyone around reading this too not go near BT!  Every time I try and I mean try to get a reason or figure out why our internet doesn’t work most of the time every time the response I get is try plugging it in and out.  Absolutely ridiculous!  Final straw was I tried to use the online chat service and after them asking for my details several times through three different folk they ended up cutting us off! I am appalled that people still use these shower of cons~~~,Morayshire~~~,2018-09-30~~~,1,1,1,1
Every 5 minutes the internet would fail and kick everyone from the internet it sometimes would go off for more than 10 minutes before it finally came back on we have had problems since October 2017 and it's not October 2018 don't waste money on this boardband it's the worst we have ever had~~~,~~~,2018-09-30~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
There is a lack of communication between BT and me. My broadband package expired this September  but BT doesn't contact me to inform this and charged £20 extra this month. It was ridiculous to pay £63.49 to pay for the broadband package?!I complained about this issue over the phone  one staff advised me to continue working with BT and was able to offer me £36.99 for the broadband and line. I ended the call as I wanted to have a conversation with my partners but was not told the price would be different next time! I called in twice afterward and was offered £37.99 and £39.99. Everytime I called in and ended up with disppointment and the problem couldn't be solved at all. I am so disppointent with the service and price offered. It is defiitely a wrong choice to work with BT and it lets me down all the time!!! Never come back again!~~~,Burgess Hill~~~,2018-09-29~~~,1,2,2,3
Just terrible. Have been with BT for over twenty years  the broadband has been really bad over the last five years or so.Stuttering movies  drop outs and terrible customer service.~~~,Dorset~~~,2018-09-29~~~,1,1,1,1
I cancelled because of the many price rises and when your tied into a contract there's little you can do. The service was relatively good but did go off on many occasions. Absloutley discusted with them. We cancelled well with the 30 notice and they decide that they are going to charge us for the next month and once the final bill is generated then they will refund us...after 7-10 days. Be different if we owed them. Waffle on about the terms and conditions but where's the consideration. Just out to Rob your money so glad I cancelled. Been passed about departments for an hour minutes absloute rubbish!!!!~~~,Pontefract ~~~,2018-09-29~~~,~~~,~~~,3,2
OK where to start. Spoke to sale person on Wednesday 19th September at 11.30 am. We ordered Business broadband with 4g assure we went with the 4g assure package because we run a ecommerce business and needed internet access before our line was installed. The sales person promised me the router would be delivered first thing Thursday morning. i was initially impressed. Thursday came and went no router Friday came and went no router i thought it must be delivered Saturday you guessed it no router Saturday.  Monday morning 24th September great router delivered Plugged it all in no 4g assure working (we have a strong 4g signal in our unit)50 phone calls later  now Wednesday 26th was promised by a person high up in BT another router would be delivered the next working day. Thursday 27th no router Friday 28th Royal mail have been and no router.Final straw i phoned and cancelled  synopsis over 50 telephone calls hours of my time wasted very frustrated  if i could give zero star i would Trying to get hold of someone in BT now to claim compensation guess that will be another 50 calls~~~,Strensham~~~,2018-09-28~~~,1,1,1,1
I am a company  we contacted BT to connect a new line and broadband.the engineer arrived on the monday as planned  but did not install a new line  I was told a survey for an extra cable was needed  this I was told would be within 48 hours and my new line would be fitted by the end of that week.after no response and calls I finally get told the survey would not happen until nearly two weeks later and the line installation a date could not be given.So we are moving in to an office with nice new computers  desks and chairs    even a nice coffee machine  but no telephones or broadband! We are a service company  with no telephones!!! BT you are without a doubt the most pathetic organisation I have had the misfortune to deal with. The Legal case stars now!!~~~,Somerset~~~,2018-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
I wish there was an option of 0 star. Worst customer services. Charges are 2 X more than Voda and speed is also half. Can wait to get rid of them....~~~,Ilford~~~,2018-09-27~~~,1,1,1,1
We moved and needing reconnecting. The date we will given didn’t go ahead and had to wait another week. This is the worst customer service I have ever experienced. The staff really don’t care and don’t want to deal with you. I wish we didn’t sign up again and will be looking at leaving them in the future. Be aware people they take your money and don’t do what they say they will.~~~,Gloucestershire ~~~,2018-09-27~~~,1,1,3,3
i joined bt 2016 and i was very happy with them and the services that was provided until i moved in 2018  they dropped my package to the lowest speed without telling me and let me carried on paying for fibre prices and i spent 3 months down the phone arguing with them and waiting for engineers not turning up  and my contract was gonna end in october 2018 when it came close to the time they told me im in contract till february 2020 so i took on the fibre package and im only getting speeds of 0.15mbps i now want to cancel and they wont let me cause they said i have to pay the old services fees  load of rubbish they are and cant wait to get rid of them.~~~,kent~~~,2018-09-25~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have gone to the BT web site. Entered my postcode and ordered the fastest broadband+TV package available. The technician has visited in 4 days to install (This is unbelievable right? 4 days only. What an improvement!) He told me that the line can't support such high speeds so I need to cancel the order and get another package. I have called BT Support  it took 2-3 days to cancel the existing package and they told me that they will order internally for the new one. They ordered the same old package with activation date 15 days ahead. Guys are this a joke?!! Compared to international standards (I can get a broadband in 1 day in any country other than Europe) this is not only silly  it is a rotten service standard. Why the hell everyone has to wait for lazy Open Reach bustards for 15 days to get a connection? Get lost.~~~,London~~~,2018-09-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I moved into a brand new development mid July and received confirmation that I could place an order for broadband on the 31st July. I called as soon as I had the confirmation to place the order the same day. I was assured that once the hub had arrived  I needed to follow the instructions and that I should have a full working service by 3rd August. The 3rd August comes around and the hub had a steady amber light which indicates an Internet problem. I followed the troubleshooting instructions which sent a signal to BT telling them there was an issue. I received a text message the next day 4th August telling me they needed to book an engineer to attend the property and the earliest time they could do this was the 15th August. Due to the nature of my job  I am unable to take time off for scenarios like these and therefore my mother attended the property for me. The gentlemen told my mother that he couldn’t fix the problem and gave us a code which I had to relay to the BT complaints team. It turns out that Openreach had wired up the lines externally incorrectly and another engineer needed to attend to fix the lines. The earliest they could do it was exactly a week later. Wednesday comes around  the day the engineer is coming to repair the lines and the day I was promised for the 3rd time that I’d have a working connection . I receive a telephone call to say unfortunately they were unable to carry out the works and they can’t give me an indication of when it will be fixed. During this period  I’d racked up a large mobile phone bill due to data upgrades that I really needed as I was exchanging emails from the site team of the development regarding to snagging lists and meetings as well as trying to set up the other utility bills in the house. I expressed to BT that I’d had to add on this extra data due to the circumstances I have noted above. A gentlemen told me not to worry and that I would be refunded and all I needed to do was send them a copy of my mobile phone invoice. I called the day before the engineer was supposed to arrive the first time just to double check the times and also to reconfirm what was said to me regarding the data refund. The women had no idea what I was talking about and said that BT do not under any circumstances offer this kind of compensation. She opened a complaint and told me that they would look back through the pre-recorded telephone conversation and would get someone from the complaints team to call me back with a resolution to this problem. This did not happen. I was not actually offered any kind of compensation until the phone call I received from the young lad who had to tell me the engineers couldn’t fix the telephone lines. Even then  all I was offered was £50.00 credit on our account which didn’t even cover the cost of the data upgrades anyway. Any how  I get home the night of the telephone line scenario and the broadband was working. I sat there confused as to why they phoned me to tell me that the service wasn’t fixed and wouldn’t be for some time.. I tried to call to let them know the service was fixed but I never managed to get through to anybody. I had a holiday booked for the 27th August which they was aware of. Whilst I was away  I was inundated with emails telling me I still had no broadband and they didn’t know when it would be fixed. I decided to ignore these numerous messages as I was on my holiday. When I returned the broadband was working so I made another 2 phone calls and an email to tell them the service is working. A week later at 7:30am I received a phone call from an engineer who was outside my property telling me he was here to install my broadband. I had absolutely no knowledge that any visit was booked to install any broadband? I’d called them a week earlier and told them it was working.. I had to turn the engineer away and filed another complaint for the lack of communication. I come home today and the broadband hub is a steady amber light meaning there’s a problem with the connection. Just when I finally thought that the situation had been put to bed  the monster comes out the closet and here we are again waiting for an engineer to come to my property and tell me they can’t fix it again and they don’t know when it will be fixed. Here’s to another racked up phone bill which I will have to pay and a sky cinema package which is totally useless. Here’s to more emails between myself and BT and more broken promises. If I had the choice to take my service elsewhere  I would but unfortunately due to the type of internet that I can have in my property due to an arrangement between BT and the building company  I have no choice but to hand money over to company that cannot even provide a service. Nothing but stress and aggravation since the day I placed the order. Gutting.~~~,Witham~~~,2018-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible costumer service with poor broadband network provided i have 4g network on phone faster then their cable connection dint get any help from-the operators are just passing my call from one to other put on hold and then close the call.They charged 30£+ extra a month at the end of contract refusing to give any money back or offer you a deal.What BT are doing is lure good deal  with new costumers and as soon are hooking you on contract they just ignore you but are very good on charge extras.For the peace of mind stay away from them unless like me you had no other options as they run all lines One star ratings is too much for them.~~~,Purfleet ~~~,2018-09-20~~~,1,1,1,1
not sure why there are so many negative reviews; we have had BT broadband/phone for 11 months now; never had any problems  fast speed (usually around 50 MBps - as 'promised') reliable landline - only reason we're (probably) going to change is that the initial 12 months discount expires... and now things get really expensive :(~~~,Manchester~~~,2018-09-19~~~,4,4,5,5
My first experience with BT Broadband  which was a quick fix for my VOIP requirement  is that the engineer didn't even turn up and I have to wait three more days for an update.  Rubbish!~~~,Histon~~~,2018-09-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Strongly not recommending BT!!!BT Breached all codes of practices and they simply don’t care! Charging for the speed of 67 MB  delivering a speed below 11MB  insisting to get me paying full contract of 18 months even though their emails says I had to pay only for the service I have received!!! Ignoring my calls and emails even on social media so the 14 days would pass so you would have to pay the termination fees!!! No matter how many years you have been a loyal customer  Just Wait till you have a problem and this is when they all get very rude to you starting from advisers up till managers!!!~~~,Manchester~~~,2018-09-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Diabolical customer service.  They frequently fail to call back even when escalated to personal case manager. Engineers that come out are clueless and don't report back the problems  end result is order Jan and cancelled in September with no line even being fitted.~~~,Suffolk~~~,2018-09-18~~~,1,1,1,1
It’s really horrible and poor service . I move from London as well I call one customer assistant just change and not inform enginier for change Bt connect again I called them what happen I don’t have internet connect .

They told me it will be connect inside 24 but not next day I call them every body just only talk with me just 1 minute then cut call   I am really tired   when I told I wanna leave then they stay with me long time without cut my call . Never join with Bt   expensive even poor service .~~~,Hampshire~~~,2018-09-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Utterly useless company. 6hours on the phone  always the same response with all of their staff... I'm sorry to hear that  let me sort it out... then they dont.  I ran up Virgin and within 20 mins got my wifi at £10 cheaper and it was up and running within 3 days.  AVOID THIS COMPANY~~~,Cambridge~~~,2018-09-17~~~,1,1,1,1
miserable services  totally disappointed.paid £7.99 for a one-day voucher and never got the code. tried contacting customer support and all 4 operators I have asked for help have shut the chat window.most rude  unhelpful and useless people i have ever seen in customer service!basically  i have paid for some services i still cannot use and their operators refuse to help.this calls for a complaint to financial ombudsman  i would have never thought that bt is stealing customers' money! shame on you!~~~,Leicester~~~,2018-09-16~~~,1,1,1,1
Switched from another company to BT and had a horrible experience. Their TV service is different from their competitors (Virgin and SKY) meaning I had to rewire all the aerial/antenna system. Also  you need the tv box to be connected to the router  which is not so obvious. I have my router net to my computer for work reasons  and I cannot have my computer next to my phone line and TV at the same time. SO I had to turn my house upside down just to get the cable connected in the right place. The installation engineer came and did not even open the router  he said I could do it myself. Total madness~~~,London~~~,2018-09-16~~~,2,2,2,2
excellent customer service - glasgow call centre of all places! i've never had any problems with the internet. wanted to switch to cheaper broadband provider but was put off by the bad reviews of other isps.  call and haggle for better price at the end of your contract - if need be call more than once. they do reward loyal customers.~~~,london~~~,2018-09-15~~~,5,5,5,5
Would give zero if possible. I was with EE and BT 'slammed' my line  cutting me off. EE tried to contact BT to get the line back but BT refused  I contacted them myself and got no where. I had nothing to do with this company yet they managed to cut my internet off due to their own error and then refused to fix it. No internet for 3 weeks  eventually had to leave EE and go with Virgin as they have their own phone lines.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2018-09-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Utter rubbish since getting bt I have nothing but trouble always getting cut off with internet signal saying authentication problem. I reset hub more than once still didn't resolve it I restarted. Y phone making sure that wasn't the problem still didn't solve it. I can't connect to my hub and neither can my kids customer service only open till 22:45am from 7:30am no one on live chat after 22:45 I checked my service in my area it said that the was no faults which must be a load of BS I can't log in with my husbands details (as he is the account holder) kept saying I put the password in wrong to many times even though it works when I use bt openzone when I am out and about.~~~,Leigh~~~,2018-09-15~~~,1,1,1,1
2 Years and we have had a fault every week. We have spent days off work waiting for engineers to come round  we have had our business disrupted constantly (self-employed) and lots thousands of pounds through downtime being unable to operate  we have spent the equivalent of what must now be days on the phone trying to raise fault notifications and complaints and we get nowhere. We get charged full price for a service which is operational 50% of the time. We get no compensation and ultimately  the issue never gets fixed. We are leaving.~~~,"Perth, Scotland~~~",2018-09-14~~~,1,1,1,1
I had the ‘20’mb connection. Equating to roughly 1-2mb at peak times and about 4mb at its very best. Can’t even watch a film at peak times with good quality picture.rendering it near enough useless in the evening.Was told that unless I dip below 0.5mb download then that’s still acceptable. That’s 2.5% of what’s advertised. 2.5%!!!Avoid at all costs. Had to pay £100 to leave my contract early.~~~,SE London~~~,2018-09-14~~~,1,1,1,3
Shocking customer service  read all these negative reviews before joining but thought I knew better and try it out  regretting this decision now  will see my options as I am without a phoneline and broadband since BT cancelled my Sky subscription without properly processing my order  so now left without anything for minimum 2 and a half weeks  the customer service when I rang up was the worst I've ever known  no one could help me  and the lies and deception from them to get rid of me and transfer me to department tondeoaetment was bad.~~~,London~~~,2018-09-14~~~,1,1,1,1

Most shocking customer service Ihave probably ever experienced ! Systems and ways of ordering are utterly shambolic ! I moved house and could not get my new service sorted despite many phone calls and hours of my time . Told something different every single time I called . Got given a 2 month post move date for activation then when tried to order new order online got given a date for a week ! It’s a complete joke of a service . I have been with lots of internet providers none of which have been great but BT tops it by a million miles as most shambolic chaotic service with systems in place that are inadequate staff that are either useless or are completely crippled in what they can do by their computer systems . Would not recommend to anyone and as soon as my contract is up I will be leaving no matter how good their tv packages are ..... it’s just not worth the hassle when things go wrong   If my dealing of problems inMy job we’re the same I would have been sacked a long time ago !~~~,Coates~~~,2018-09-12~~~,1,1,3,3
Shocking customer service - I wish I could leave and go back to Virgin but I would have to pay over £200 on the cancellation fee.~~~,Cardiff~~~,2018-09-12~~~,1,1,4,2
I got disconnected every hour for a whole year. I called their technical department every week to report it. Each call took at least 45 minutes  after being on hold  security questions and the tests they had to run. Every time  they told me there were no faults on the line  and therefore wouldn't send an engineer.  After complaining  an engineer was sent. He said there were loads of faults on the line and couldn't believe it had been left in such a state. When I complained  the customer service completely ignored my complaint. I escalated the complaint to Cameron Skupski  who was completely useless. I'm still awaiting a response. Horrendous experience.~~~,London~~~,2018-09-11~~~,1,1,1,1
I'm so ******* done with BT it's absolutely slowest internet I ever had!!!! Paying monthly is more than 50£ FOR WHAT???? Always disconnect's   very slow  and  Then you try to contact services and after you trying to explain the issue they hang up the phone!  You know you can find it better network for 50£ in month so I'm so done.!~~~,Ashton~~~,2018-09-10~~~,1,1,2,2
I cant pick up my router from the conservatory and we're in a normal 3 bed semi. It also loses connectivity quite often. tried to get this resolved but they just run the same tests and threaten to charge me £150 to send an engineer out.~~~,Stockport~~~,2018-09-09~~~,2,1,4,2
Constantly broke down and ran at speeds far below what we paid for. Customer service is awkward and clunky. At one point we had an engineer in to fix the box which he said there'd be no charge for. Then  three full months later  he apparently has decided there is a charge  resulting in our final bill being inexplicably almost to £200 instead of the £60 it should have been. Avoid if you're a student or  for any other reason  have a fragile bank account. The amount of times we've been hit by seemingly random and unexpected charges under these guys is frankly an absolute joke.~~~,~~~,2018-09-07~~~,1,1,3,2

We can't even rate Broadband speed and reliability sections because we didn't even get a connection sorted! Simply put  we had the worst customer service experience in our life... We were recommended BT Smart Hub by EE staff and we cancelled our precious EE broadband contract and bought BT Smart Hub. It was supposed to be available from 3 weeks ago but then it never happened because of some issues BT had. We made total of 12 phonecalls to check the progress  and each call took 30-1hr. Worst thing is that none of the staff members had clear answer  nor kept a promise to call us back. So after 1 months of no internet period   we decided to cencel the contract.  It seems that their rapid growth in their business is not in parallel with the improvement of training programme for staffs... we were very disappointed and with we didn't stop using our previous router.~~~,London~~~,2018-09-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Thieves. The internet in my flat has not been working for  a week now. Called them several times and they always say and do the same useless things. The usual switch off and on. They said that if I want to have an engineer coming to fix it I may get charged £120! It's your internet that is not working and I have to pay for it? It's a shame that there are no good broadband companies in the UK. Avoid~~~,London~~~,2018-09-04~~~,1,1,1,1
