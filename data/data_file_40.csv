This is now the 5th time. Yes  the 5th TIME that we're trying to get internet home with BT and ONCE AGAIN IT FAILED.  I have spent a total of upward of 10 hours on the phone with BT. This is scandalous. The incompetence is beyond anything I've EVER seen and I've lived in many countries. I'm going to start a class action. BT is making money from these customer service phone calls and I believe there is a real slyness behind this incompetence. Reading comments online  I am not the only one to be so disappointed and I believe there is a real chance for a class action to stick. They've lot more than 10 hours of my time and at 20p/min  they're making tons of money from our phone calls.Using the median. At a cost of 20p/min  that's GBP 120 + time I've spent if we use the median income hourly rate (GBP 12.5/hour)  that an additional GBP 125. TOTAL = GBP 245 I really hope we can start a class action. And BT better understand the consequences. They will be serious: in terms of brand image as well as financially once a class action starts.  Do not proceed with them whatever you're thinking. They will waste your time - unless you're very lucky which has not been my experience (I'm not the only one apparently). Christopher~~~,Reading~~~,2016-12-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Rubbish company Paid for 12 months never fix my fault  only worked for the 1st day  !!!!!! Terrible~~~,Manchester~~~,2016-12-06~~~,1,1,1,1
this is the worst service I have ever had. I swapped over to bt at the beginning of October. firstly the phone line nor the internet worked even though they did before I changed.after waiting 2hrs on the phone managed to get hold of someone they said there is nothing wrong but would book an engineer to come out.1week later an engineer came out said nothing wrong outside and they wanted to charge us £129.I rang again 1.5hrs later spoke to someone who said they will send another engineer out. yet again no problem apparently .. still no phone line or broadband.rang again their exact words were nothing they could do. after complaining they admitted that the line hadn't been switched over !!! this was done 48hrs later and all seemed well.but 24hrs later broadband went down and guess what still not working 2months later and the official line from bt is nothing they can do.but they still are charging me for the service. I am trying to switch again but this is a struggle as the new company are saying that bt are blocking it even though I am paid up to date etc..if you want to keep your sanity do not use bt !!!!~~~,kettering northamptonshire~~~,2016-12-05~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
Guys  if you think you have got a nice life  don't have enough problems to suffer  then BT is for you!  In the last 6 days I met so many people who is not interested in helping you with a problem. My broadband is not working for 2 weeks  today engineer visited me and nothing happened! The doggiest and the worst provider all over UK! THEY DO NOT PROVIDE ANY SERVICE BUT THEY HAVE THE HIGHEST RATES! NEVER EVER WILL SUGGEST IT TO ANYONE!~~~,London~~~,2016-12-05~~~,1,1,1,1
They advertise as the most reliable WiFi signal. This is not the case. I switched from Virgin Media due to rising cost. Never had any issues with the WiFi signal with Virgin. When I switched to BT I gave it a week or so to let equipment settle down. However broadband kept dying several times a day. After a few weeks and phones calls and eventually an email to their complaints department I finally got some testing on line that determined Hub was faulty. New hub installed. However  WiFi signal is terrible. I use BT app on phone to check service regularly as devices will disconnect and my phone often says switching to mobile data (as I have it set on poor WiFi to use mobile data)  This is even when sat in same room as BT hub. Once year is up will be finding different provider.~~~,Grantham~~~,2016-12-05~~~,3,2,4,2
Just discovered BtT have been money from my bank without my permission for over two years despite me cancelling my account my subscription with them. Apparently I didn't cancel the free bet sport so they've been charging me for this. Be warned. Also the reason I left them was due to a poor unreliable service.~~~,Glenrothes~~~,2016-12-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Pathetic customer serviceInsanely long waiting times on phoneEngineer does not turn up as promisedOrder not placed as requested. (Choose the address they wish  date they wish  cancel the order without informing) Nobody takes responsibility on customer service and keeps on transferring call saying other team is responsible. Each call transfer comes with overhead of atleast 20 min holding time.  Would have given NEGATIVE stars if there was an option.~~~,Greenwich~~~,2016-12-03~~~,1,1,1,1
I have the highest level of broadband Infinity and the latest Hub 6. The service is very expensive  with prices rising at least twice a year. The broadband drops out whenever ther is the slightest storm  wind or rain. TV advertisements are usually dishonest and deceitful  making outrageous claims as to coverage and reliability. 'Deals' are offered to new customers only with no regard to loyal customers. Would advise anyone to look elsewhere as BT offer a poor  expensive service with little respect of customer loyalty.~~~,Bognor Regis~~~,2016-12-02~~~,3,2,4,3
To say I am upset is an understatement. Customer service appalling. Promised a call back to discuss/finalise and complete my claim that an adviser set up on my behalf  still waiting for the call...3 months later to the day! They have managed to lose my original landline which I have had for years and use for work. This has affected my business hugely to the point where I have had to get new leaflets/flyers printed to my expense with the alternative number they have provided me with. Waited in for 3 hours for technician - no show! Told would have 2 call backs -still waiting. Told they would waive a couple of initial charges due to the inconvenience I have been caused  bill actually came out at £80 more than it should have!! Do you think I can get sense out of anyone at their end of the phone?? The hours I have wasted waiting on hold is beyond belief - a HUGE waste of my day. At the start of this fiasco they sent me a 'You View' box and extender kit FOC. 'You View' didn't work  only one plug instead of 2 in the extender kit. They said they would charge me £129.99 to send an engineer out to sort this - talk about rubbing salt into the wound!! If I could turn back time I would never  ever have used this company. Out of pocket  time and patience with BT!!!~~~,Lancing~~~,2016-12-01~~~,1,1,1,1
"Just a quick summary of the inadequate service I have received from BT throughout the complaint:   1.    On 21st October I received a letter from BT stating that another customer wants to take over the phone line (Ref WLTUTC). The letter stated that if I did not call BT by 2nd November at 2pm the service will cease.  2.    I called BT on 25th October to  to advise that I did not authorize another customer to take over the line and to reject the take over request. 3.    I was advised by BT that they will reject the takeover and I don't need to take any further action. 4.    On 2nd November I had a complaint from my tenant that the broadband had stopped working at the property. I instantly knew what the issue was and contacted BT to inform them of the situation. I explained about the letter which I received stating that the broadband would cease on 2nd November and this is what had happened. 5.    Although I explained exactly what the fault was to the faults team the BT advisor carried out some tests and concluded that my broadband was still showing as live on their BT system and the fault had nothing to do with the takeover request  but was in fact a router issue. Advisor said she would post out a new router within 3-5 wokring days. 6.    Although I could not believe this was just a massive coincidence that the broadband stopped working on the date the letter said it would I gave the advisor the benefit of the doubt and she arranged to send a new router out in the post.  7.    On 5th November I called BT for an update with the router. The faults team now changed their mind and informed me that the fault was not down tot he router  but it was now due to a network error which would ""100% be fixed by 9th November"". Again  I informed the engineer that the problem was down to the takeover request and again my advise was disregarded. 8.    The broadband was still now working on the 9th as promised and when i called up i was shocked that the faults team now state its the router and sent yet another router out.  9.    So far we have had 2 routers and both of them did not work. BT were still insisting it was a router fault so we decided to go out and buy our own router costing me £128. Again this did not resolve the issue so again BT sent a third router out which did not work. By this point I was angry  frustrated and disappointed in BT staff failure to identify a problem even though I kept insisting that the fault was down to the take over. I was still being ignored by the faults team. 10.  BT decided it was best to send an engineer out who was booked in to visit the property on 17th November. The tenant and his son both took the day off work to wait in for the engineers visit but the engineer cancelled the appointment on the day. This meant that the tenant lost wages taking unpaid leave to sit around for the engineer who did not even turn up. This was now causing myself and my tenants unbelievable stress and disappointment.  11.  We were advised that the engineer did not need to visit as they found the fault and promised the broadband would now be working on 19th November.  12.  The 19th of November came and again more disappointment as the broadband was still not working. It was only when I was put through to the cancellations team in the UK to cancel the service with BT that I actually spoke with a woman who actually listened to me and done some further investigation and discovered that what I had been saying throughout this ordeal was actually correct. She discovered that the takeover was rejected by BT but the broadband had somehow slipped through the network and was cancelled.  13.  Finally  someone in BT listened after 2 weeks of messing me and my tenant about. At least now we knew what the issue was. 14.  The broadband was finally back working on 24th November (3 weeks after the fault was reported). 15.  Throughout this time I have spent over 10 hours + in communication with BT. I have spend over £80 on phone calls from Thailand (not once would BT staff call me back as they stated they cannot call outside the UK). I have been given 4 different guaranteed dates when the issue should have been fixed. We have had to take unpaid leave to wait for the BT engineer who did not turn up  the tenant has had to use excessive mobile date due to no broadband  We have spent £128 on new router  I have had to pay the tennant £400 in compensation  I have been put through hell by incompetent BT staff who refused to listen to me. All of this could have been avoided if BT just listened to customers and stopped being ""robots"" just doing what they are told to by a computer. 16.  This has been the absolute worst experience I have ever had with a service provider in my life. It has caused me so much stress and anger. 17.  So I would expect the following to be compensation: £80 calls from Thailand public phones10 hours of my time talking to incompetent BT staff @ £10 per hour = £100£128 for the new router we had to buy as you advised the 3 BT sent out were all faulty.£100 for the stress and inconvenience this has caused me when I am supposed to be on holiday.£100 towards the compensation I had to pay the tenants for taking unpaid leave to wait in for the engineers plus the excessive data usage when wifi was not working. Total claim £508~~~",Liverpool~~~,2016-12-01~~~,1,1,3,1
Living in an area where we have a BT only exchange we have limited choice of supplier.Whilst the broadband has-been largely reliable and reasonable in speed when there have been problems it has taken hours and hours talking to customer services being kept waiting and passed from one department to another. I cancelled my mobile and they continued to charge me! Then I recently cancelled my home phone and broadband  despite emailing me to confirm this they again continued to charge me for a service I was no longer receiving!! Taking money from my bank.If an individual did this it would be deemed theft.In both cases it involved hours of calls to resolve  something I will not miss. Until they have decent customer services I could not recommend them.~~~,Wales~~~,2016-12-01~~~,2,1,2,4

The worst customer experience ever!! Been with sky for 12yrs but they can not supply fiver broadband in our area. Order fibre on the 9/11/16 to be installed in the 23/11/16  had a call on the 11th no engineer available was then moved to the 01/12/16 had a call on the 14th no engineer available was moved to 02/12/16  received a call 29th guess what yes no engineer available so we are now looking at the 5th December. Call many time to complain but never any manage available..if only another provide was in my area. AS A NEW BT CUSTOMER I WILL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO MOVING AWAY ASAP..

"DO NOT SIGN UP TO BT....EVER!!!!!!I have been with BT for a number of years with minimal problems until recently when  i experienced repeated dropouts & snail speed. For the last 8 weeks  I have been trying to speak to somebody & getting them to understand this problem  this has nearly turned me insane. I am no further forward today as I was 8 weeks ago. When I requested to speak to a manager I was told I couldn't & they would only reiterate what the first person said. Every promise I was given was then contradicted by the next person  telling me ""my colleague wouldn't have said that  you are wrong"". I repeatedly requested the recordings of my conversation with BT only to be refused or no one ever called me back. I have so many reference numbers been given to me and constantly been told there is nothing wrong with my line or broadband & I haven't experienced any drop outs!!! The latest instruction from BT was that Wi-Fi is not guaranteed & I should be running ether cables to all my equipment. Even though I have a blue light on my hub that clearly says WIFI. To add insult I have been charged £7.50 for 'late payment' & the £20 gesture of good will that was promised hasn't materialised either. The worst customer care service I have ever experienced in my life. Like I said... steer clear!!~~~",essex~~~,2016-11-30~~~,1,1,1,1

Unless you are desperate for BT sport steer well clear!  I have had 7 weeks of hell dealing with these people and 16 phone calls. Initially ordered on 6/10  online via top cash back  that order was cancelled  re-ordered on 10/10 that order also cancelled. Apparently my line still belonged to my previous supplier. The 3rd time I ordered over the phone which meant I have lost out on £105 top cashback. They assured me I would be connected on the 7th Nov. My phone was connected on 14 Nov  Broadband on 21st Nov so over 6 weeks after initial order placed. I lodged a formal complaint which BT have failed to give me any resolution on and asked to be compensated but have been told there's no chance of that and I cannot cancel as I am now in a contract with them! This is by far the worst company I have had to deal with. Please steer well clear like I say unless you want the sport! 16 calls to them in 6 weeks  dreadful!~~~,Redruth~~~,2016-11-29~~~,1,1,3,3

Kerry from South Shields helped me to sort out a difficult problem when switching my 2 BT mobile accounts  saving me from losing my old phone number whilst still getting an excellent deal. I just want to say a huge thank you for her quick thinking to find a solution and her understanding when dealing with the issue. I hope she gets some sort of recognition for her outstanding customer service! :)~~~,York~~~,2016-11-26~~~,5,5,5,5
Like the majority of people on here - my experience has been dire. Customer service is  ridiculous  trying to communicate a relatively straightforward problem to several different people who still manage to get it wrong - BT Communication  (jjoke) happy to say I'm leaving their backward services as is the rest of my family.  Don't put up with their Bad Treatment (BT) you have choices. Only positive note - any other provider now has got to be an improvement. Communicate your dissatisfaction to as many people  as possible too - maybe one day BT will wake up and listen to their customers.~~~,London~~~,2016-11-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The worst customer service I have ever had.The service was so poor it's beyond belief one hour and ten minutes to get through on the phone on 4 occasions no one calling you back took 3 weeks longer than the agreed date to connect phone and broadband.Booked engineer to fix broadband fault determined routers faulty want me to sign up to new contract to get a working router do not join them they can not cope the service is worse than awful.I never post reviews stay away from them~~~,Bournemouth ~~~,2016-11-25~~~,1,1,1,1

Recently moved from Virgin to BT  what a mistake. Broadband keeps going off  Unable to get most of the Internet TV channels.

No one you speak to can or will make a decision~~~,Kent~~~,2016-11-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Please don't risk it. BT are fine if everything works  but appalling if anything goes wrong (which it has nearly every year we've been with them).  Their customer service is the worst I have ever encountered. They will pass you in circles to avoid answering your question. They will phone you up just so they can put you on hold.~~~,Barnet~~~,2016-11-24~~~,1,1,3,1

I suffered with broadband speeds of less than 0.5mg for 2 months before moving to super fast broadband. During this time I spent so long on the phone trying to resolve and was always told there was a problem on the line we are sending engineer to fix. This happened more than 3 times and problem was closed but nothing ever changed. Felt I had no option but to upgrade after which I got approx 2 mg. I complained again and I was fobbed off with anther engineer but again no fix. Finally after using complaints procedure got an engineer who went up pole outside and fixed the line problem. For all my hours on the phone and months of them not delivering to contract was offered first £9 and then £11 in compensation. This is a big company who has lost control and as soon as my contract is up I will be off.~~~,warwick~~~,2016-11-18~~~,1,1,3,2
After suffering repeated outages and slow internet speeds etc I decided to give Demon Vodaphone the boot and swap over to BT Business Infinity and BT Business Telephone line - two separate lines. The orders were placed  the hub was ordered  Demon were given notice of the take over and every thing was set for the grand swap over on the 31st of October. On the 25th of October no router had arrived so i rang BT Business - hello said I - where is my new router? Oh dear said they - your order has been cancelled - why said I - we don't know - turns out their office in India cancelled the order because they could. The manager from BT Business re-instated the order for the 31st - India cancelled it again - and so it went on - round and round and round - BT UK would order the service - then India would cancel it. I now have a temporary service on the voice line - so we have a choice of dodgy voice or intermittent sloth like broadband that is even slower than Demon and also more unreliable - plus the Hub-5 that screeches like a fish wife and glows like a nuclear reactor! All along BT tried to blame Demon - today I got an email from Demon proving that BT had been fibbing - they were waiting to vacate the line and had been since the 14th of October. BT even had the temerity to say that my BT phone was the cause of the problems - it was never a problem when the Demon was there! Customer Service is a joke - even when escalated up to the Chairman's Office gavin.e.patterson@bt.com in case any one wants the address or sme.service.scotland@bt.com - 0800 085 3662 - not that it got any where - 17th of November and I am still waiting.

I chained from Virginia media to BT fibre in which my change over was meant to be active with BT from 17.10.16 and to this day I'm still not active. My Virginia contract ceased on 31.10.16 which was nearly 2 weeks after my BT services should have been up and running and still not BT service and to top it all off I have a business line in my property for my employment and the incompetence of BT being who they are they disconnected my business line as this was the only live line in the property at the time which has caused me to now have to place a new order to get the business line transferred to who it should have been in the first instance. I have lost money from this major mess up. They claim that they have had a problem with re systems as to why it's taking so long to get my services up and running meaning that they cannot send jobs to the engineers they are British telecom can they not use a phone to communicate like everyone else it would this be too simple. I had an update today regarding the activation of my BT service and was horrified to discover that an engineer had finally been to the cabinet on the street and now says there is not a spare fibre port to connect my broad band they can install new ports to the cabinet but it's a big job apparently in which they have to dismantle the cabinet to do so and this takes up to 3 months apparently to complete so the service I was promised I am no longer getting in which I could have been advised on this over 6 weeks ago prior to me cancelling my virgin media broadband as now I'm left with nothing not to mention having to pay all the BT activation charges and also have a new to Ariel fitted which cost me £130 at the start in which I now won't need as won't have BT tv as all they can offer me now is 4mb per second instead of the 50 I was promised and they say the 4mb will not be enough to get the BT to and the BT sport service that I signed up for. I have had multiple problems from the start of this process and been robbed off time and time again every advisor I speak to tells me something different each time. I would not ever recommend this well known company as they have caused me nothing but problems and issues throughout along with the major inconvenience with the issue with my business line and now I'm thinking of reporting them to watchdog due to the false selling and the bad service they have provided or should I say no service has been provided.

"Went back to BT in March 2016  we live beside a BT exchange  were paying the higher price to get a ""quicker"" broadband service. I had complained every other month to them. The speed of the broadband never changed  even with one person in the house  simple things like going on facebook was near impossible! They had verbally told me on the phone when I returned to them that I would not be tied into any contract with them.  This again was revoked when I left them this month due to disgustingly poor internet service and came up with all sorts of ""get out clauses"". Even though mine was I was not paying for a service that I was not getting! So  now have to pay £148 to get out their contract plus return their equipment  which I thought would be included in the monthly charges?  But I would NEVER  EVER again touch BT with a barge pole  and have already told loads of people in the large company I work for about my experience  which has definitely put a few people off BT!!~~~",Craigavon~~~,2016-11-15~~~,1,1,2,1

Hobson's choice here with service providers. In general though the 20Mbs speed is acceptable and the service is generally reliable. However  the biggest bug-bear ever is the VERY poor customer service. They simply don't care. If it can't be answered in 5mins and from a script then forget it! I've been 2 weeks and counting with an issue and passed from pillar to post and all just want to get you / me cleared off their books just to satisfy their KPIs.

"Horrendous wi-fi and terrible customer serviceOptionson ‎12-11-2016 14h08 50 minutes on the phone to try to ask when I can get out of my contract.... The reasons are: Having recently migrated to BT from another provider (fibre to standard broadband) i was left for over a week without any services  somehow my socket had become faulty..... Once this was working I started to notice that I had no wi-fi in my other rooms in the house. I tried resets  everything  but still no wi-fi. Deciding to call bt for assistance I was informed I could ""Purchase"" a super router 6 which would give me a better signal... (I didn't care about the quality of signal  just as long as I had a signal  which I didn't have). So here it is folks... Join BT  lose service for 7 daysExperience Broadband like no other  ie no broadband or wi-fi in other parts of the houseCustomer service  terrible beyond belief.
