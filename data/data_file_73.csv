BT needs to be either investigated by PANORAMA or DISPATCHES on a monthly basis  I have forwarded all our complaint to watchdog (BBC)... promised a package and start date  which once we moved turned out to be a joke   spent an hour on the phone with a woman who found English hard who promised to ring back and who of course did not  further calls and the date got even later leaving school children who need the internet due to illness at home with no internet and our business at risk DUE NOT USE BT~~~,Woodbridge~~~,2014-09-05~~~,1,1,1,1
"If you are in the midst of deciding on your provider  DO NOT USE BT. BT for start is so unreliable  one minute the internet could be working and a reasonable speed then within the hour  it is taking ten minutes to load a youtube video; honestly 3G in my house is sometimes faster!! To try and find positives in BT's customer service is like trying to sugarcoat a turd. WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE?! BT will put you through to some random in India and keep you on hold for UP TO AN HOUR. If  by this time  you are not already annoyed  they will continue to aggravate you by ""not being able to send out an engineer for a week"" even though you were promised one two days ago  because ""your call wasn't logged"". Honestly BT is probably the most god awful server  they make their money through the calling charges you rack up when they place you on hold. So to conclude  DO NOT USE BT.~~~",Sevenoaks~~~,2014-09-04~~~,1,1,3,2
Our bt wifi has never been very good  however recently it has got worse. I often need to reset the router to get my devices to connect. And when the do it is sometimes slow. I recently sent them an email but got no response  and so I have had to write a bad review. I am sorry it had to come to this  but you left me no choice. Thanks for your time Callum~~~,"Sealyham, Pembrokeshire~~~",2014-08-29~~~,2,1,2,1
The most appalling service i have ever experienced from any company. they should be made to pay back money which they rob from there customers.i have had unusable BB and barely usable phone line on and for for 8 months. 20 or more calls to customer service and no further forward than day 1. they are criminals. will cancel as soon as contract ends and never ever use them again. DO NOT USE BT AT ANY COST~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2014-08-29~~~,1,1,1,1
"I have been with BT for over 10 years and have upgraded to their ""Fibre Optic"" Broadband which isn't really fibre optic. We had a problem with our broadband diconnecting constantly which led us to the fibre optic ""upgrade"" to 40mb speed which is better than our previous 25mb. But back to this  we had several drops in our connection including our Landline being unusable due to poor installation for starters. The customer services ""HELPline"" Help being the word we would believe to be legitimate rescue. Were far from a helpful service being on hold before they answer for going on 16 minutes finally get an answer from a gentleman with a questionable name being ""Lorraine"" for some strange reason. Lorraine then went onto explain that it was clearly my fault although the final conclusion was an installation flaw where the tech that came out failed to finalise our connection on BT's end. But Lorraine the gender confused man was insistent that it was all my fault cheers BT. I now work for virgin media and as soon as my contract is up will be switching over or maybe will just pay for the hub to get out sooner had enough...~~~",Swansea~~~,2014-08-28~~~,1,1,2,1
Had to comment about the awful customer service and incompetence of BT  both Phone and Fibre.First off I must say the product BT Fibre is not an issue  works fine only a few drop outs. But the Customer Service  wow how bad was that. At first we had to deal with India who couldn't understand me or half the billing issues  then when customer service came back to the UK  rather than get better it appears to have got worst. I am in the dying throws of changing from BT after year to PlusNet (who by the way have been great - take note BT). I tried to get BT to simply allow me to change to PlusNet  i.e. get a MAC code etc  oh no was told had to cease my service even after said I would need MAC code etc for PlusNet as would be going with them. No couldn't do that  later in week called again after talking to PlusNet who correctly advised that was wrong etc  was told this time whoever had done order before was wrong and that would sort it and gave me my MAC code (I trusted them -bad move)  again when spoke to PlusNet they advised still unable to put order through even with MAC code. Another call to BT different person  then later call back from their person as she was telling me my date for ceasing etc had turned from sometime in sept to 29 august  again told by new manager that they had sorted the cease and set everything correct for PlusNet to do. So next PlusNet tried and got half way - i.e. it let the order start but was not fully confirmed. So checked again why PlusNet having issues today  they couldn't see from their end  so spoke to BT  first guy said and confirmed that Cease was back on after it was supposed to have been stopped and that wouldn't have internet and phone after 29th Aug. Another call to PlusNet and this time  who said explained why no confirmation on their order  so they cancelled and said sorry but you would have to talk to BT to get rid of cease and make into migration  which should be not an issue. Another call to yet another BT person this time somebody who deals with cancellation  who apologised but said in fact that after tonight I would have no Internet and Phone  not after 29th and that because was so close could not stop cease and could not do migration. sorry but that was all he or anyone could do  took a note of the fact that I have paid for my full month of August by Direct Debit and said to reference this when get final bill to get back any money already paid from 27th till end of August. So through all this I get nothing from BT in terms tracking of my call (unlike PlusNet  where at least you get an email of your query and question)  I get told one story after another - I am half expecting that internet is about to die any moment as I a writing this  no real apologises  no really managers who want to know at this late stage of your annoyance - nobody today would let me talk to manager even after they had talked to their manager about issue. So stay well away from BT - they haven't a clue what is going on  they tell multiple stories and just don't care about their customers.BTW - never mentioned all the issues about my billing from the start because it would just take ages. I think at this rate the amount of time I have spent trying to sort things out with BT  they should employ me and pay me at least it would then be worthwhile.~~~,Bucks~~~,2014-08-26~~~,1,1,4,4
Even giving a one is to much.  The service I receive for 8month was 0.6 and this was from the very beginning I had to pay a engineer to inform me it was BT fault from exchange to house even then would not refund for bad service.  Csr and managers spend our money to learn to be rude so have left and had to pay Â£55 for a hub that did not work adviced to send this back and I would be refunded ( you guessed it never happened ) stay away from BT if you have a choice~~~,Livingston~~~,2014-08-26~~~,1,1,1,1
It is very slow and it only works in the room that the box is in and when it came to be installed they said it would work with 3 bats in every room and it only works in one room and also if you have 3 bars it's still slow but if you have 2 bars it dosent even work and that is very bad so please could you make an improvement kind regards and I don't mean to be rude if I am coming across rude I am very sorry~~~,Mires ~~~,2014-08-24~~~,1,4,1,1
The service BT provides is awful. They arrange appointments and do not turn up (although appointment has been confirmed multiple times  including the day before)  incompetent assistants with poor training  who put the incorrect order through multiple times; they inform you they will follow up on orders/ queries and get back to customer  but never call back; charge you for services you are not using; unaware of departments within their own company (which you have had contact with previously - when you call to follow up on an order they just inform you the department does not exist - although you have been told by customer service to call the department previously). My broadband and telephone line were scheduled to be installed  over 1.5 months ago and it still has not been due to their mistakes! Terrible! Go with virgin  sky  hyperoptic  any company but BT~~~,London~~~,2014-08-24~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT are the worst company I have dealt with for customer service. Many calls are dealt with off shore (and the line isn't very good - irony anyone?). It took over one month to connect my phone line and two months for broadband. The advisors are generally hopeless  lie and fail to get the problem solved. I curently have a broadband fault open. This should have been fixed by now but  having just phoned BT  they have failed to raise the fault correctly (what ever that means).BT used to be a monopoly and they deal with customers like they still are. I will never be a BT customer again.~~~,Nottingham~~~,2014-08-21~~~,1,1,2,4
Absolutely shocking I been getting up to 4mb download until  mid August.  Repeated texts from them saying they had tried to contact me to resolve the problem. Agreed that speeds were .25 mb and problem was between their exchange and my home. A total nonsense!Still unresolved as of now!~~~,Glasgow~~~,2014-08-20~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have experienced an ongoing intermittent connection with barely usable internet. Customer service is appalling - the constant hoop-jumping means that a solution is never achieved and the compartmentalisation of departments means that the company functions appallingly. It is shocking that such a manifest breach of contract is shrugged off by such a big player in the telephony market.~~~,Devon~~~,2014-08-20~~~,1,1,2,1
I can hardly find anything positive to say about this service provider as of now. Firstly let me mention the engineers  they're hardly competent at performing their installations job  we recently moved home and wanted the fastest package possible  sure we have that but at the expense of half-trained engineers. They proceeded to go forward with the installation without any regard for the previous installed line  absolutely no testing was done whatsoever. We called them on this regard several times  once in a friendly manner explaining the issue. I was informed that they would be running tests and would get back to us shortly  being a patient person I waited 2 days (no call came through)  after those 2 days we contacted them again  this time we got through and managed to get information regarding the issue. We got informed they would be sending an engineer out by Tuesday  sure Tuesday came  no engineer came. We contacted them  yet again  we were informed that no engineers were active that day. Surely common sense tells us that they should've checked the schedule in the first place. Evidently not. (An engineer will be sent out Thursday - So they say). The entirety of this issue could have been avoided if they tested the line in the first place. Just to add even more annoyance they send the bill. I'm adamant on refusing to pay this until I've actually had some service worth paying for. Had I known that the service provider was this poor in my area I would've avoided them entirely I will be more inclined on writing a far more friendly and accurate review once I've actually experienced some services. (Sorry to those of you reading this review - I know it is rather long and detailed)~~~,Corwen~~~,2014-08-20~~~,1,1,4,1
totally scamming company i paid all my bills on time and they said i owe them Â£50.27 and theyre charging me Â£12 for re-connection fees i had no satisfaction on the phone to customer services they wouldnt put me through to a manager even though i ave all my bills and my reciepts and i had too pay one of the bills twice as they apparently they never revieved it andwhen i told them i wanted my Â£54 they owed me the put the phone down on me needless to say they will be hearing from my lawyer~~~,glasgow~~~,2014-08-19~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I have had to go thro 3 x 45 minute plus telephone calls with customer service all to no effect - On speed test I normally get less than 1 Mbps often less than 0.5 - My plan i.to contact trading standards ii. issue claim in small claims court for refund for broadband charges since start of contract. Plus comp for my time on phone. I would NEVER recommend BT Broadband to anyone. In ratings I would suggest negative ratings because I so resent even giving them 1 x star~~~,Guildford~~~,2014-08-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Bloody disgusting we ring up a call centre worker hangs up so we report on facebook. Then next day ring in again and we are told we will be compensated !  then when it's eventually fixed you say you don't count weekends even though we are paying for those days and you don't count the day I reported on facebook  and the same day your call centre worker hung up. Then today I explained my mum has been with you decades and will leave the reply was if you decide to that's up to you !!! Great thanks !! So 5 days no phone no internet and no great customer service. Do you want to retain your long time customers ? Who haves been with you many decades? Clearly not then when we contact to explain on facebook they just delete posts.   Terrible customer care~~~,Stockport ~~~,2014-08-16~~~,1,1,3,1

I would echo most of what people have already said regarding BT.  The broadband worked for 2hours and then stopped. The customer service is also terrible.  The staff are content trying to defend the poor service and don't listen.  I switched to Virgin and I am glad I did.  I had to cancel on 3 occasions as the service was still running.~~~,Ilford~~~,2014-08-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Sick of BT They have given me a lousy Â£3  refund for doing without Broadband for over a week and nothing previous times when it  has gone off. They come up with lots of excuses but never refund properly. So much for customer care. I shall not be usuing them again and I say to everyone who reads this  that they are a rip off  over priced  and provide no service. END OF.~~~,~~~,2014-08-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Customer Service and ability to deal with problems  is a disgrace from their Indian Call Centre It a service given on the cheap and it certainly shows.. Getting anything right is just a bridge too far for them. Monkey's would do better~~~,Devon~~~,2014-08-12~~~,1,1,4,4

They have the worst speeds for broadband  the connection consistently drops  the BT Box equipment is faulty  constantly freezing  restarting  slow  unresponsive  and Im paying Â£5 a month for what is essentially freeview  and to get BT Sport for free  I have to renew my contract for another 12 months  NOT A CHANCE. They also overcharged me for months on end  refunded me and then tried to take more unauthorised payments to the extent my bank blocked them no matter what I said because of the amount of refunds to me. Then they tried overcharging me  charging me for a late payment when it was 3 days early  then they kept disconnecting me about once every 1/2 weeks even though I was paying monthly  charging me Â£25 to reconnect me then charging Â£2 to pay online even though my bank blocked their direct debits because they kept taking unauthorised transactions out the account and they act strongly on theft and fraud. Apart from the latest advisor Ive spoken to (must be about 80th!)who was appaled at how I'd been treated  each and every other one could barely grasp the english language and were rude and it was a horrible experience everytime. I have never felt so stressed with a company before  just dont risk it!~~~,Merseyside~~~,2014-08-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Speed is simply pathetic. Last month it jumped from Less than 5 mb to over 14mb; that was brilliant now it's back to the same old bt bad service at below 5mb.~~~,Stuminster Marshall~~~,2014-08-03~~~,1,1,1,5
BT have consistently  over many years  set their standards low and failed to achieve them. Their customer service is nothing short of a disgrace  and they make it as hard as possible to contact them. Having just (stupidly) given them one last chance and upgraded to Infinity  it shouldn't come as a surprise that my line speeds are slower than they were with my old package. Avoid them like the plague- they are simply shocking~~~,London~~~,2014-08-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Is BT slowing customers' broadband down on purpose to force us to upgrade? After being nagged by phone calls from BT prompting me to upgrade  I turned them down as I do not want to be tied to a 2 year further contract. Coincidentally  their broadband service has got worse in the last week.~~~,Bow~~~,2014-08-02~~~,1,1,1,1
I've had problems but worse is my son's experience. He ordered a BT package for his new house and was promised it a week ago. He stayed in each day but it has not arrived. Every day he rings them and is reassured it will arrive the next day. He now tried to cancel because they are not giving him a service but they say he can't  How come he has to keep his part of the contract while they don't keep theirs? Totally inadequate and when I move soon I will not sign up with BT again.~~~,Northampton~~~,2014-07-28~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been a BT customer since 1998. Not for much longer. Due to very poor customer service I have decided to take my business elsewhere. The package is overpriced  broadband often unreliable and the included email service is sub standard  unusable majority of the time and the spam filter is useless. They have barriers to their complaints process and refuse to let you speak to a senior manager. In the case of the complaint I raised about the broadband reliability and the poor email service I found that they did not follow their published complaints process. They do not engage in lasting customer relationships and loyalty counts for nothing.~~~,Staffs~~~,2014-07-25~~~,1,1,2,2
"For 7 weeks now Bt has striped me of i/c and O/g e-mails cut-off my B/b and have sent scatty with conversations which did'nt appear to be understood whilst all the time collecting each month  money from my a/c.They have lost all emails for the last month or so!Letters sent to the Chaiman  Ceo  but progress so far NIL.Yesterday he phone rang twice and on answering ther was no one there .Entry in log ""we phoned but nobody was there"" Sharp practice!!!~~~",aberdeen~~~,2014-07-25~~~,1,1,3,1
I am 82 years young and have just had the most awful experience with bt upgrade to infinity. They gave me connection dates which never were changed 3 times Then there technical support team asked all kinds of questions which were over my head my son has spoke to them about asking me to take screws out of sockets and plugging things in I have know idea about I could have been seriously injured if I had taken a 240 mains socket of the wall !!! I have now cancelled my set up and will move to a more competent provider.~~~,Derby~~~,2014-07-24~~~,1,1,1,1
When BTMail started  I lost all my email addresses on MacMail  I contacted BT on 3 occasions and spoke to BTIndia.on all 3 occasions it ended up after they had read thru their sheets with failure. I have paid my line rental for the year so would lose this if I try to move to another ISP.I was told it was a problem for Apple which is rubbish and that I should pay Â£35 and talk to them. Lately I got Sky TV and although I have Infinity it still takes up to 20 minutes to download a one hour programme if you try to do it at 5pmI am waiting to see what they do next. Maybe it will be someone in the UK!~~~,Ashford Kent~~~,2014-07-22~~~,1,1,3,2
The worst idea my mother has ever had !! Bt youview box and broadband dnt work half the time the hub turns of every hour or less the demand players dont work andwe have had a tech person out every month since we got it in ! Every time u phone to get it fixed u cant understand the person over the phone and they are ignorant to you ! Bt is a  useless ... that I have told everyone how much problems we have had and that I will never be working with again !!!!!!~~~,northern ireland~~~,2014-07-21~~~,1,1,1,1

The worst customer service of any provider I have ever used. They are flat out liars and will tell you one thing  and then change their minds. A word of advice for any poor soul stuck with this terrible company  get everything they tell you in writing.~~~,"Leeds, UK~~~",2014-07-19~~~,2,1,2,1
Huge disappointment. Had been convinced by them that not only would the broadband be consistent and speedy but that Infinity would be coming within 3-6 months. Neither has proven true along with no way of getting e-mails from my private domain (which every previous provider managed to do). I should have known better - it is BT after all. Tempted to say more (lots more I could say) but there's little point as no-one will listen  let alone do anything. So - see out the contract and leave BT (again) - this time never to return.~~~,Bristol~~~,2014-07-17~~~,2,2,2,2
just before moving house I was persuaded by BT to upgrade to INFINITY.Dreadful experience ending in 30 min call when I was passed from person to person including a rude line manager.Despite cancelling an engineer turned up next day for an apt they said they had cancelled. Would have been funny if not so stressful.Never ever sign up to this bunch of clowns!Unbelievable that they then continued to email text and ring me weeks later about my order for broadband.~~~,maryport cumbria~~~,2014-07-17~~~,1,1,1,1
They became frustrated when I asked a few questions about installing broadband. It was like they only cared about the sale and not giving information about the product. I hung up and called Virgin. BT is terrible. No one should use them as it seems they are only interested in taking money. Not happy  and will never use them!~~~,London~~~,2014-07-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Bt is slow expensive not reliable dont get it you will be ripped of I had to pay 365.59p for cancellation fee f that I normally pay about Â£45.00-Â£60.00~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2014-07-15~~~,1,1,1,1
wasn't too bad while I was with them but trying to cancel has been a nightmare and they even charge  Â£40 to stop your broadband.I cancelled in may and got a letter saying we are sorry you are leaving yet they recon im still with them and they are trying to charge me up to 26th july and ive been on virgin since 16th june~~~,notts~~~,2014-07-10~~~,3,1,4,4
After endless problems with slow or non existent broadband I considered changing  but due to no chance of having fibre optic in our area in my lifetime I had to sign up with BT again  the only plus side is that I am now only paying half of what it was last year.The problem is simple but BT will not admit to it  the infrastructure for telephone and broadband in the UK is really old and will cost a fortune to upgrade.Most homes in the UK had a telephone in the 60s and the same cables and junction boxes are still there.All emerging country's are on fibre optic as it was the obvious choice but most of this country will still be stuck with copper wiring for a long time.I am not defending the horrendous customer service of bt that makes every caller feel like a retard but when a previous government thought it was good to have competition they forgot that BT was still expected to maintain and upgrade the exchanges and lines.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2014-07-10~~~,1,1,1,1
