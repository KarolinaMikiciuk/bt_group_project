Dear BT - wake up we are in 2015 and you are supposed to be a communications company Just had 8 days of no broadband many phone calls and texts between myself and BT and the broadband is back on well done BT  however ...........BT accepted they made a catalogue of errors inculing mis communication between internal departments and me the paying customer   they accepted the fault was at the exchange and should have been identified immediately  they accepted they failed to call me back when they called from india and the call got cut off   they accepted the BT staff (except the engineer that fixed the fault) needed more training and had not done their jobs correctly   they accepted that if they were in my position they would be completely dissatisfied with the service and wait for it ...... In lite of all this i was due some compensation ........ Yes a whole £15 Wow i said lets go and party ! Or i sugested the BT staff came and worked for me for 8 days for £15 and this would enable them to unerstand a customers point of view - SO  BT you have a long way to go in customer service and communications dealing with you is like dealing with an automated tarot reading machine yes keep putting the money in and she will keep giving you cards containing lots of false promises ! Well done !~~~,Wakefield~~~,2015-03-31~~~,1,1,1,1
"I recently quit my job as a customer advisor for BT  the worst job ive ever had. Getting shouted at by customers for the failures of engineering company Openreach because they are utterly incompetent. Having to phone their indian call centre everyday for useless updates to pass on to understandably angry customers. Quite often they will not turn up for appointments because of ""lack of resource"" i.e not bothering to send engineers out and not letting anybody know . Try telling that to customers who are on their 3rd missed appointment. Also the fact that we are allowed no more than 900 seconds for each call and have near impossible targets . They just want advisor's to get them off the phones without too much hassle. Joke~~~",fife~~~,2015-03-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
READ THIS GUYS!!! I never write these but I've had enough now! I'm having to do this on my mobile because my internet has crashed again and India (who can't understand me at all or are aware of the details on my account at all) decided that it's the line which was tested on the Thursday by an engineer to be fully functional! Since I joined BT I've had nothing but problems. Lied to on the phone and once a month I pay for nothing!  I moved into my grandads house after losing my job and having to move back home it took me 4 months to finally give in and think why not I'm still paying for it I might as well get internet installed till the end of the year.  I asked the guy on the phone for BT if my grandad could keep his home number and I have a seperate one for my internet  the landline was provided by talk talk. They said that was fine oh was I mislead! When the engineer installed the hub he gave me a new number and everything was working fine then I got a call from BT to confirm my number transfer and once again I asked them if my grandad would keep his number they said yes. Long story short they cancelled my deal with talk talk stole my grandads number and used it for my broadband. So now my grandad has to be calmed down each morning before I go to work because he can't ring my mum to let her know he's ok. The phone line has been cut off by talk talk. He has Alzheimer's for God sake you sick people BT! Just because you can't listen!  4 weeks he hasn't had a landline! Now my internet has stopped working AGAIN!!! I want to take this to court and make them pay for this!  To fix the whole problem they tried to charge me 50 quid!! I'm stuck in limbo now with no internet and no landline thanks to BT's award winning customer service well fuck you BT! All you cause is upset and more money added onto the bill!!! Read this and know I will be taking action legally against you if I can afford it after you ripping me off for over a year!!!~~~,"Blackpool, UK~~~",2015-03-29~~~,1,1,3,1
"They aggressively up-sold my 76 year old father to fibre when he wanted DSL promising it would be cheaper  proceeded to charge him for services they said they would throw in free  provided him with a broken YouView and all this took a month a month and a half of wrangling with their ""customer services"" and literally two days on the phone so far. Still not sorted. Aggressive  misleading sales-people  entirely broken customer support. Expensive compared to the competition. Much more trouble than they are worth. Avoid at all cost.~~~",Cheshire~~~,2015-03-29~~~,1,1,1,1
BT  Bt when will you begin to become the leader in communications. I wish I could tell Sid how crap you have become since privatisation. A useless company that does not want customers. I am constantly surprised as to why customers do not move from BT. On a monthly basis complained about Broadband connection. Finally agreed that Router was at fault but wanted me to sign another contract before sending me another router!! Well I am in the process of moving elsewhere!~~~,Stratford on Avon~~~,2015-03-28~~~,1,1,1,1
the worst broadband everadvisers not trained to help just to hold you on the phone for over an hour to download crappy help tools and your issue is never resolved the way it should be. when my contract is finish i will be looking for another provider.For your sake never sign a contract with them~~~,Birmingham~~~,2015-03-28~~~,1,1,1,1
BT want to get there old Customers back from what I see  but there is no way I would ever recommend using this Company  regarding Customer Services or there Broadband which was a total nightmare trying to understand on numerous occasions by speaking to some Foreign hard to understand English Speaking Broadband Representative that never sorted the continuing wifi lost connection that we eventually sorted by having a trouble free Sky Setup. Ps with BT make shure you always find out who you have spoken to and get it in writing to save you frustrating hours on the phone.~~~,WEST BROMWICH~~~,2015-03-27~~~,1,1,2,1
I am spending between £60 - £80 per month for a t.v service which we cannot use; broadband that constantly drops and that I can only get in the room of the router;  and a phone line. I cannot get out of the contract and would face nearly £400 to cancel early. We tried to do this anyway (thinking it would be cheaper after about 6 months) but backed out within the 14 day period I was given as we could not afford this one off £400. We were still charged £12 as they apparently had a reconnection fee. I am despairing about this situation. I can't afford this and it is just HELL being contracted with this company.~~~,Aberdeen~~~,2015-03-25~~~,1,2,1,1
had 2 bt engineers round to try and fix the problem and the same issue keeps coming back~~~,coventry~~~,2015-03-24~~~,2,2,2,1
The speed advertised is never what you get  but you would expect a lot higher than the speed available here. also the BT online speed checker is not very accurate when compared to other unbiased versions.~~~,East midlands~~~,2015-03-24~~~,1,3,1,2
What a shambles  been with bt 3 months of witch 2 months on the phone  to them  if I do another reset I will break down  on my second remote as they thought that will keep me quiet  noooo!! They have no clue  they wanted me to have a cable running down the stairs to feed my computer upstairs  how dangerous..They haven't a clue and can't wait to get back to sky !~~~,bromsgrove~~~,2015-03-23~~~,1,1,1,1
The only thing more appalling then this ridiculously slow and unreliable broadband is lack of service. I have had this for one month and it hasn't worked properly. Each time I call I get old something completely different. This is no better than a scam.~~~,Islington~~~,2015-03-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Seems like a good package on the face of it and yes I knew it was going to be slightly cheaper for the first six months. However  I didn't expect that my bill would go up from £20 to £40'within a year and all that time I haven't been able to watch full programmes on many TV channels as my TV has pixelated since going with BT. Never had that problem before. Real shame because I really like the TV package but it would be as cheap to go with Sky or Virgin. Going to change asap. Wish I had never bothered with what I thought was a good and reliable company. How wrong I was!~~~,Dronfield~~~,2015-03-22~~~,1,1,1,2
For over a week now we have had the wifi dropping out every 30 seconds. I have been on the phone to an Indian call centre for over 6 hrs in total. I have done all the diagnostics they have asked me to  some more than once. I have spoken to managers who have not been helpful  i have been cut off twice and promised call backs which I have not recieved. I have had to unscrew boxes on the wall and expose wires! I am still without wifi after all this and no sign of an engineer.I  have been asked to buy new equipment and renew my contract before they will help me  even though my contract has another 9 months to run. I warn anyone thinking of taking an account with BT NOT TO!!! they have no concept of customer service and I am at my wits end. I think i will cancel my direct debit and let them take me to court!~~~,Bristol~~~,2015-03-19~~~,1,1,1,1
I was stuck with BT for over a year due to my location and am now switching to Virgin. Imagine my eye popping rage when I saw that virgin offered over 3x the speed of BT for the same price!!! I picked up the phone and did battle with some fairly depressed sounding BT customer service drones. They fed me plenty of contradictory information and sales-lies before they finally granted me exit from their overpriced laim-speeds. Farwell BT  you are an outdated face on the head of my time.~~~,Plympton~~~,2015-03-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Contacted customer service what a shambles. Ran tests blamed our equipment  supplied by bt as part of the package. When they get stressed they blame Internet connections in your area. Funny when you ask what area are having issues they say areas hundreds of miles away. Perhaps they should teach a little geography to the Indian call centres.Having said that still no broardband stability as it keeps dropping out an bt still blame our end.The worst bit is they do not know what the issue is and cannot be truthful about anything~~~,Norfolk~~~,2015-03-17~~~,1,1,1,2
Just moved from BT to Sky .. as my broadband kept dropping every couple of minutes had reported this issue many times but never got it sorted plus i got the same deal with Sky for half the price .. Been with BT many years so much for loyalty.~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2015-03-16~~~,1,1,2,1
Having recently declined an offer to upgrade  Lo and behold my bt internet connection has become extremely slow. Ha any reason bt? Your call centre in Dheli  Indiafailed to find a problem. An honest answer would be appreciated.~~~,Pembrokeshire~~~,2015-03-15~~~,2,5,1,1
DON'T GO WITH BT - THERE ARE MANY CHEAPER OPTIONs.  THEY ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND THE MOST ANNOYING PROVIDER.I've just been stitched up by BT.  I moved house and stupidly  to keep life simple decided to move with them.  This meant that I had to change my account  as I was persuaded as it'd be cheaper.   Now here in lies a snag.  You only get 14days from the request to get a BT account  even though you may have been an existing customer  to ditch it.  Not 14 days from when the account commences or the standard 28days you get from the majority of services/products you purchase.   BT said I would have service on the 2nd  then the 4th  then 6th  then 9th.  This meant a full 7days without BB  with the phone link kicking in on the evening of the 6th.  The phone line was noisy for 5days.  Every time I received or made a call the BB cut out.  It did restart but was frustrating.  So I need an engineer.  To add insult to injury  I get read out a standard if your equipment is at fault you will be fined £120!!  When I complained and requested compensation  well guess what folks  they will only offer compensation after the fault has been fixed. Dire customers service - and I mean the UK call centres.  Awful.   As soon as I'm can afford to I will be ditching BT.~~~,Bath~~~,2015-03-14~~~,1,1,2,2
we have recently moved house and i requested BT to continue providing service to our new place. I was absolutely shocked and disappointed how awful BT after care service is!!For the past 6 weeks i have made numerous phone calls with regards to connection drop outs wireless failure!! some how any technical complaints ends up in India. Those BT Indian staff members are bunch of lyers  they will make false promises yet fail to deliver. They are very good at apologising but fail to take any positive action. i was so saddened and disappointed the way BT have treat me. After six weeks i am still having problems with my broadband and BT refuses to terminate my contract without charging silly money. i would never recommend BT to any one after the latest experience. Please think carefully before you sign on a dotted line with BT. in my experience once they have got you signed in and got your money they dont want to know your problems!!~~~,Rotherham~~~,2015-03-13~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Worst experience I've ever had with broadband (and I've used many other ISPs).  BT are perhaps the most incompetent company that I've *ever* come in contact with  and I would not wish being exposed to their services upon my worst enemies. Main points from our experience:- After being given an 'activation date' that was pushed back twice  it was then pushed back another three times (each time adding an extra week). After 5 weeks we still had no service and tried to cancel it completely. - A BT engineer turned up at our property completely uninvited AFTER we had cancelled the account. I let him in anyway to see what he thought - he confirmed that everything we'd been told on the phone from the faults team was completely false (they told us it was an exchange problem - which he said if true would mean the whole village would be without broadband  which wasn't the case). - After 5 weeks of no internet or any service I tried to cancel the account and BT tried to impose a £270 cessation charge - despite themselves breaking the contract by not providing any service. - When I tried to cancel the account  instead of actually cancelling it  they just raised a complaint  gave me an incorrect reference number (meaning I had to go through the whole process again)  which delayed the whole process of cancelling the account.  Generally  it seems that no one on the end of a BT phone number has much authority to do anything - nor the ability to accurately diagnose or solve likely problems.  By contrast  after cancelling BT we went for EE - who had us up and running straight away with no hassle. What's amusing is that they obviously use BT engineers and the BT lines for their service... which shows just how incompetent and useless ordering through BT is. Having spoken to several other BT customers  it doesn't seem like our issue was isolated. Our neighbours use BT Infinity and they said they're just waiting for their contract to expire as the service is awful.  If you were considering using BT infinity  I'd strongly recommend going elsewhere - even if it means paying more  it'll save you from hours of phone calls with useless BT staff and spending weeks trying to configure a service that will probably never end up working.~~~,"Didcot, Oxfordshire~~~",2015-03-09~~~,1,1,1,1
BT Infinity - As I write this I'm getting ping response times in the many thousands of ms from google.com and download speed of less than 1 mb  I believe I'm paying for 36 mb ish~~~,HP6 5RT~~~,2015-03-08~~~,1,1,1,1
"This has to be the worst broadband I have ever had. I operate on a Mac based systems and have never had a problem with my broadband. I travel and lot and I have always been able to get a connection. However  ""up-grad"" to infinity and I have had nothing but problems. The system simply will not allow my mac laptops (yes plural - there are three in the house) - to hook up to the internet. I have complained to BT three times and they access the system remotely but deny there is an issue.  Sometimes I can get access to the WWW but this is quite rare. I spoke with BT today and they insisted it was  a problem with my Mac systems and not their equipment. I asked them to prove this was the case and they were unable to - instead insisting that their equipment was 100 secure and working. I'm left with no option other than  to sue to breach of contract. DO NOT UP GRADE TO INFINITY AND THE LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM BT IS SHOCKING.~~~",Kent~~~,2015-03-08~~~,1,1,1,1
I was having troulble connecting to the Internet  and my computer showed me a Phone number to contact. This was a recorded message that told me there were no issues in my area so i should log on to an e-mail address!! Then it hung up with me not being able to log on as i had no internet. I eventually contacted BT after a week  and was told there was a computer glitch and my order had been overlooked. I was promised on a number of occassions that i would be contacted (none of which happened)  so i had to keep ringing back to be told i would have to wait yet another week for my activation date! As i write this i am stillwaiting to be connected  so i hope when this happens it is a good service...~~~,Yorkshire~~~,2015-03-06~~~,2,3,1,1
bt ask us to change to infinity we agreed had always had evening and weekend calls for years and asked for it with the new package. we were sold the new package with just weekend calls and all our evening calls for 18 months were being charged because we are elderly and bt take the money from our bank we didn't notice for all that time we were overcharged by £300 over an 18 month period and bt are not interested in there mistake just waiting till may when I can end my contract after many years with bt avoid this company~~~,hampshire~~~,2015-03-04~~~,2,1,3,3
The security is useless. If all passwords including the online login are reset by the reset button then all parent controls are useless! The customer service is awful. I ahve called about the security issue. I was first told repeatedly that my account was not with BT and that I was wrong. I provided all my details  eventually they found my account from all the CORRECT information I had provided  no appology was given. The opperator was short and rude.  To resolve the security issuee I was told to put the router in a wooden box. You can buy routers that do not have this issue. Overall the service with BT is awful. I have had problems in the past and avoided BT for this reason. I had heard they were better... they are not.~~~,London~~~,2015-03-04~~~,1,1,1,3
Extremely disappointed in the service provided by BT.  The new e-mail system is a bit of a joke.  I feel that the customer service that is provided is just there to frustrate you and make you give up on the enquiry/complaint.~~~,Anglesey~~~,2015-03-04~~~,2,1,1,2

I had BT for both broadband  TV and telephone for a few years. In 2012 I switched my telephone service to Utilitywarehouse as I got a better deal from them as they also covered my gas and electric. After receiving a new broadband box and homehub I have received appalling signal  with many TV programs not recording due to a lack of service. My phone does not get full signal from under 2m. DO NOT USE BT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. THEIR SERVICE IS APPALLING~~~,Harpenden~~~,2015-03-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The most atrocious  frustrating  pointless 'customer service' I have ever had to deal with.  Hours of my life wasted trying to get them to answer simple questions  navigating through their labyrinthine website  or selecting options on the phone  only to end up with a nice Indian lady who has clearly no idea what I'm talking about  and fails to solve the problem every time.Avoid them at all costs.~~~,Southampton~~~,2015-03-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
We asked for a good speed internet as we have a few devices and what not that'll be on the net at the same time. They've given us crap that can just about have one device using it at a time. That'd be the ps3  noway could anyone else even think of using the net cos the lag is unbelievable. I constantly get the flashing orange light and can't do anything  its really slow!! considering we can only use one device at a time you'd think it'd be pretty quick but no. I've never had broadband this bad in my life.~~~,Waltham Abbey~~~,2015-03-02~~~,1,1,1,1
WiFi on Home Hub 3 stopped working and advice from Customer Services was to buy a new hub from another manufacturer since BT do not support WiFi and will not replace defective hub. Netgear Hub works perfectly  but after about a week speed dropped from 3MB to 2MB so suspect BT have reduced since I am no longer able to support FON users.Dreadful customer support and will probably change in Jan 16 when contract expires.~~~,"Brentor, Devon~~~",2015-03-01~~~,2,1,1,3

We live only 30 miles south of central London and we get only 1Mbps and we are unlikely to ever see high speed broadband. So much for the government's commitment to even nearby rural areas.

Terrible! thats all I can say. They have a fibre activated exchange some 0.2 miles from my property (and many other sin centre of town including many many buisnesses) and the NEW green fibre boxes evn closer (in all within 0.5miles ten boxes (i have counted them BT! and yet it is only a elite few in Lockerbie who can recieve infinity. My contract was taken on the assurity that infinity would be available at the start of this year (albeit a verbal promise  In scotland Verbal is as good as written) however it has failed yet again to supply any dates  information or truth. I for one have told them they have until May when my contract runs out and then they can collect their hub  phone and line from my car park where it will be after being ripped out!

Broadband in our Village is dreadful.  We are not far from Cities of Bristol & Gloucester  yet there are times when broadband fails.  Speed at very best can be 1 mb   but much more likel;y to be a lot less.  On occassions when I have tried to test the speed  it has been so slow it won't even drive the speed tester. We had hoped that fibre broadband would be coming to the village when BT brought it to our local exchange.  But 2 years on we are told they aren't.  This is unacceptable in 21st Century in England.  Time BT monopoly was stopped.  We pay a lot for a poor service.  Worst of all is that letters to BT never get answers and one can never identify who makes the decisions. Do something about it!!!~~~,"North Nibley,  Gloucestershire~~~",2015-02-27~~~,1,2,1,2
Be advised. Don't go with BT. They are dearer despite a poor service. Be warned there is a £30.00 Cancellation charge  if you ever leave BT broadband  not to mention the arrogant customer service agents.

Unimpressed and angry with BTUpgraded to Infinity 1 unlimited after our normal BT Broadband was getting worse  ie frequent times when no internet available .suspected they were doing it on purpose to nudge you into fibre super fast broadband.My New hub5 arrived on schedule and for a few days my speed was almost the 37 meg as advertised. Then tried to watch Eurosport Player bloody hopeless. Stops after a every couple of minutes useless trying to watch live sport.Started getting emails from Libby  in customer services asking for their Youview box to be returned. We had BT TV for over 12 months and paid £50 to BT for the Youview box and was told at the time that after 12 months we can keep the box .I declined their reduced price offer of £2 per month when I upgraded to Infinity 1 . They have a nerve to keep asking by text messages as well as email for the box back.To add insult to injury they have just charged me £5.60 for exceeding my monthly allowance of 40gig.Don't these stupid people know that I have unlimited broadband use with Infinity 1.after being persuaded by them to upgrade.Oh and checked my speed today 5 meg this morning and 10 meg this evening.I have threatened to report them to trading standards/offcomIf they don't refund my £5.60 immediately. Don't hold your breath.Bt need exposing on watchdog or you and yours.!!!~~~,South Devon~~~,2015-02-24~~~,1,~~~,1,1

The whole package has been a joke. Apparently the problem is not BTs fault it is ""my wait for It Microwave and mobile  phones "" RUBBISH. Do they think we are stupid. We had been with Orange for  10yrs and never had a problem. I have cancelled my Direct Debit as they just keep taking money out. It's only since cancelling the Direct Debit that they now want to try and solve the problem. I have told them they can take me to  court as they will not be helping themselves to my money  anymore.
