Having been a customer with bt for several years  I've finally lost all patience with their unreliable broadband and poor customer service. I wouldn't normally be leaving such a poor review but the last straw was when they cut my broadband off a day earlier than agreed  and after trying for over an hour to get the issue sorted with their customer service team I gave up. Throughout my broadband contract I noticed a definite drop in speeds at peak times  to the extent that basic online music and videos would be continuously interrupted despite me subscribing to their fastest  unlimited package. Numerous contacts with their customer service was unable to fix this so i gave up.When the time came to renew I was unable to avail of the online offers available so my package would cost nearly twice as much as a new customer. What a way to reward loyalty!I will not be returning to bt as a customer in the future and would advise others to stay well clear.~~~,Carrickfergus~~~,2018-05-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely TERRIBLE service. We set up a cloud phone with bt. We then discovered bt internet was not available in our area. We cancelled but they kept charging us for over a year  we spent hours on the phone. We originally ported our number to bt from talk talk. After trying to port our number to a new service that could run with fibre optic they would not allow us to have our phone number back which we have been using for 6 years. Again we spent hours on the phone along with our new supplier trying to get the number. I even had one of the team members laugh done the phone at me. They have been holding our number ransom ever since. This service has been disgraceful. Avoid BT like the plague. Cannot stress this enough.~~~,London ~~~,2018-05-14~~~,1,1,1,1

"BT have been absolutely awful for the past year  both in terms of wifi connection and actual customer service. We are a group of 4 students and more often than not we cannot have more than 2 of us using the wifi. Their customer service is absolutely appalling and it is very clear they do not care about their customers one bit. They were meant to return after they tried to install the broadband and realised they couldn't not install it properly as they could not access the required room but then never returned. Since then we have reported issues on numerous occasions  and on one of these occasions they said they would send an engineer out the next day  which never happened. When asked about it it turned out they hadn't communicated between themselves and the required engineer. In the past 24 hours we were promised a phone call back at 5pm which never happened  to which our account holder rang them and once again they didn't have a note of this. The man she spoke to said he would call her back in 5minutes which once again  never happened. It is absolutely ridiculous how little they care about their customers and how time and time again they attempt to charge us extra just for them to actually do their job correct. They frequently try to play the ""number of devices"" card against us but considering the wifi is awful even when there are only 2 of us in the house or if one individual using the internet at like 2am this is definitely not the case. We struggle to access our university website and use articles that are required for our assessments and this should not be the case. Do not go with BT. Last year I was with plusnet  paying far less  with the same number of people/devices in the house and getting far better connection.~~~",Reading ~~~,2018-05-13~~~,1,1,1,1
"BT diserve  ratings Overall satisfaction   00000 Customer service      00000 Broadband speed .    00000 Broadband reliability  00000 I am happy i saw that  because from now on will take more serious the reviews...  BT I had worst experiences from them. They just interested in closing open tickets  the funny part is - their website test always show your connection is stable  (just imagine when your connection is dropped you will not be able to perform test so you can’t test and when you are on  you will test and it always show stable connection!!!) i am having broadband connection dropping issues from last few months and they are not able to fix it after so many complaints (i have many complaints raised!!!)  official complaint also doesn’t make any difference to them  recently i have called them to cancel service and told them i am moving to another service provider  the person whom i was talking was only interested in telling me how other service provider is not good rather than listening me what problems i am having and how to resolve it  the reason i think they are not losing anything so they don’t care about customer. And if this is the attitude they have I rather take 2nd grade broadband services from other service provider that listens and care about customers rather than arrogant provider like BT  and I am sure there will be many-many customers who will think this way and one day BT will feel impact. couldn't provide us with a stable and good quality wireless connection even though I am sitting and working on a computer 5m away from the BT box and there are no obstacles between us. If they told me immediately that they can guarantee ONLY CABLE connection I would have made my decision but instead they kept on connecting me from one call centre to the other and I kept on spending hours talking to  sometimes very kind but powerless advisors but sometimes to very manipulative and limiting advisors. In 6 MONTHS on the phone with BT I spent hours trying to make BT broadband work decently but in the end  it DIDN""T. In the end they offered me 30 pounds to  practically shut up or find another provider but they wouldn't let me out of the contract. They wanted me to pay up until the end of the contract. INCOMPETENT CROOKS!~~~",london~~~,2018-05-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Paying for Infinity - actualy getting Infinity some of the time  have contacted BT  however speed always improves for a while when BT contacted.  then variable again.~~~,Cornwall~~~,2018-05-12~~~,4,4,3,2
I've had many connections before this one and out of all of them BT is defiantly the worst. When first looking at the connection it looked like a big upgrade from the other connections I’ve had in the past   but it was a complete lie. Although the connection is reasonably fast most of the time  it shuts down and has trouble connecting at the worst of times which is 10x worse considering I’m an avid gamer. Even fixing the connection is more trouble than its worth with it taking about half an hour to get it back up and working properly again. The amount of inconvenience this broadband has caused me is unbelievable and I recommend looking for literally any other service provider.~~~,G~~~,2018-05-12~~~,~~~,~~~,3,~~~
WiFi drops out every time it rains and is unreliable. It's been 5 months and it's still not fixed.~~~,Birmingham~~~,2018-05-11~~~,2,3,2,1
Tried to switch to paperless billing as BT charges £2.50 per month for paper bills. Went online  clicked the option to switch billing method yet the paper bills and charges keep on coming. Have to call every month to get them to credit the charge but they seem incapable or unwilling to fix this problem.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2018-05-11~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2
"First of all  read reviews on different sites before switching to BT! You will very likely decide not to! Their service is not great  streaming freezes  Wi-Fi signal is bad  but the most ridiculous thing is that when you move you get totally ripped off. They promote a smooth free move on their official site (https://www.productsandservices.bt.com/manage/moving-home/)  which reads ""No connection fee or new Direct Debits to arrange"" and when it comes to an actual move  it turns out that they will charge you 130 pounds of connection fee.And after they tricked you into 18 months contract  you have a choice of either paying a connection fee of 130 pounds or 6 months of your contract as an early cancellation fee (for me 36*6=216 pounds).~~~",London~~~,2018-05-09~~~,1,1,3,2
Why didn’t I read these reviews first. The broadband service is the worst I have ever experienced. Slow connection  poor wireless range  constantly drops the connection. I’ve been over 24 hours without a connection once but BT denied there was an issue. The Home Hub is probably the worst piece of kit I have ever used  not does it work with any decent router in modem only mode. Plus not compatible with Apple AirPort Extreme or Express. I tried to cancel my account just outside 14 days and they said it would cost me nearly £900 in fees  despite me having first reported the problems inside the 14 days. They are truely truely terrible and I can’t wait for the day I can leave them for good. Please don’t be tempted by any of their deals as it really isn’t worth the pain.~~~,Manchester~~~,2018-05-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Where ever I go in my day I have pretty reliable service on my phone be it 4G or work broadband. I come home and I have to wait for everything I need to do online. I’m on the fastest BT ranking but cannot change it due to its Connection to a business account. I always know I’m getting close to home or I’m on the home broadband because my phone slows down. Not only that I get the joy of casually of having to wait for my Rueter to reboot for five times in one evening.  Favourite thing when that happens. I sometimes switch my phone to 4G from my own Wi-Fi connection because it’s faster.~~~,"Aston, Henley-on-Thames ~~~",2018-05-04~~~,2,3,2,2
Horrendous company  all they care about is getting you to close off your complaint. The BT tv box and service is terrible  there broadband is slow there customer service is absolutely ridiculous .

I have been with BT now for 3 months on the 76 mbps fibre package and are more than happy with their service. I have constantly checked speeds and all are in excess of 72 mbps  no matter what time of day. I had one minor issue with the landline at the start  however this was resolved quickly and easily. I have previously had fibre contracts with Plusnet (quite good although streaming tended to stutter) and Vodafone (avoid!). BT are not the cheapest but I firmly believe that you get what you pay for. Overall I am very satisfied with BT fibre.~~~,Hinckley~~~,2018-05-03~~~,5,5,5,5
Bt told me  and sent me my speed would be no less than 42 mb download speed its only 13.4 whats going on phone customer service said you are on wireless my wife is the same she is on cable he is having a joke. BT sort it or i am off.~~~,Tipton~~~,2018-05-02~~~,1,1,1,1
VERY unhappy with BT  3 times arranged for an engineer to come out to my house to solve a problem and ALL 3 times I have received a text message the day before saying they and found and RESOLVED the problem. Which after ALL 3 times the internet still has been the same. UNFORTUNETLY BT is the only broadband I can get in my area or I would have changed by now. BT I hope you read this and good luck getting a payment from me untill my internet is sorted.~~~,Welshpool~~~,2018-05-02~~~,1,1,1,1

Rubbish services  it wasn’t like this before 4-5 months (at least broadband speed was good)  suddenly their broadband service is degraded; customer service of complaint & technical teams - I had worst experiences from them.

Just rubbish internet. Very low speed  stops working every 15 minutes (I have to constantly reconnect  restart my router etc) and the customer service is horrendous. They also randomly up the price on the contract without letting you know. DO NOT USE THEM.~~~,Manchester~~~,2018-04-28~~~,1,1,1,1

I have been with BT for over 8 years. My issues began when I tried to leave them. They threatened me with a £400 fine for breaking contract. In the end I had to write to the top officials in BT to get my contract cancelled without a fine. I am with Virgin now and a much happier customer.~~~,Bexley~~~,2018-04-26~~~,2,3,1,1

My experience is that BTs customer service is shocking in fact it is non existent. I have recently switched to them for fibre bb and they have not fulfilled their promises despite much time spent chasing. Judging by all the negative reviews on here  im not the only one that is disappointed with them but they seem to have a dont care attitude!~~~,Chester~~~,2018-04-23~~~,1,~~~,1,1
As broadband providers go  BT is really not that bad. The router they supply is pretty good and is dual band so currently using the 5ghz band and get an excellent wi-fi signal.~~~,Great Yarmouth~~~,2018-04-22~~~,4,5,4,4

BT Group (the holding company which also includes Plusnet and EE) is a virtual monopoly that has very poor customer service coupled with a company that couldn't care less. The website is a complicated mess that hides what you want to find out. It is deliberately designed to sell you more and pretend they're great. ??I've had price hikes that I could not get out of and problems with speed - a problem that I gave up on because all the solutions were duff.Cheating BT. Thankfully everyone knows how poor they are now.~~~,East Yorks~~~,2018-04-17~~~,1,1,1,1
I tried for the last 2 days to place a fibre broadband talking to the sales team over the phone as well as doing it online. On all my attempts I was told either that it isn't available in my area or BT has a system issue with checking. Today I see that they have put the prices up. When again I did online chat as well as talking on the phone after going being passed to 4 BT customer team members eventually I went to BT assist team and then told that I could have the fibre but need to pay the increased new price.Eventhough I have evidence to support (chat emails) that it was their system and online form issue stopped me from having it at lower price  the BT team wasn't interested listen and was more or less telling that it was my fault. My experience with BT on this occasion was terrible I won't recommend them for anyone.~~~,Herts~~~,2018-04-17~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Please do not sign up with BT. Was going to switch so signed to their service. BEFORE installation they took over £200 off me. When I decided to cancel before my service had started I have been unable to get this money back. They have had £208 from me which they won't repay me despite them saying several times they owe it me. Nightmare company. Avoid at all costs.~~~,Derby~~~,2018-04-17~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

Having recently upgraded to BTinfinity  the guest wifi service is terrible. Only when you set up the guest wifi will you see it is branded BT  NOT your company. But using it is awful  even if you want to only use email  users must open a web page of BT advertising before getting a connection. ALSO  I had a technical problem  but BT would not help because we did not have the account number. AND we could not get the account number until BT generated and sent the first bill. How stupid could they be?????~~~,Essex~~~,2018-04-16~~~,1,1,3,1

I'm currently with talktalk at 76mbs.  I decided to switch to BT but the online service would only offer me slow internet.  I was called by a customer representative who asked to perform a credit check before anything else.  I know that my credit is fine  but following the check all they could offer me was the slow service - apparently the 76mbs is not available in my area - even though this is what talktalk provide!  The CSR told me they may be able to upgrade me once i had switched.  So my credit has been pinged for no apparent reason.  BT just seem so backwards.~~~,Rhoose~~~,2018-04-16~~~,1,1,1,1

Without a doubt the worst service I have ever been provided.  Internet speed is so slow I actually leave the house if I need to do work  consistently drops.  When trying to contact them you get put through to people reading a script having no clue what to do and nothing gets resolved.  Appalling utterly appalling...leaving them and going back to Virgin.~~~,Surrey~~~,2018-04-13~~~,1,1,1,1
