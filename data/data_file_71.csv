I had infinity installed last week in my new house and it was completely unreliable.On Monday I called them expecting to be on hold for hours  passed from person to person  etc.I got straight through to a foreign call center. Here we go I thought.How wrong I was. The guy was very efficient and actually listened to what I said. After he had performed a few tests his end he agreed there was a fault and escalated my case. He told me an engineer would go and check the main box and I would get a call back on Wednesday evening.Again I was skeptical.Anyway  on the Monday evening my broadband was completely down for an hour or so. Where they really fixing it this fast?By Tuesday it was working much better and on the Wednesday evening  as promised  I got a call from the same call center guy asking how my service was now.I said it seems much better. He said he would keep the case open anyway to make sure and send me a text. If I have any further problems he said to just reply to the text and BT will call me back within two hours.I'm a little astounded. This was great service. Quick  efficient and simple.I'm the first to give out bad reviews to companies that deliver bad service so thought I should post about how good this service was. Well done BT.~~~,St Austell~~~,2014-11-20~~~,5,5,4,4
I changed from sky to BT broadband because of their claims for a better service...... Worst mistake ever. Constantly loosing connection and all BT do is say they need to do checks on the line.~~~,Stourton~~~,2014-11-19~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Joined bt about a year ago and I have had a problem with line speeds from day one.As I write this review my line speed is only 0.84Mbps. Dispite regular complaints all I get is someone from a call centre halfway round the world telling me there is no problem with my line. I have even sent them screen shots of the results from BT wholesale speed test  to no avail. The one star rating I have given is way higher than BT deserves and once my contract is finished I will have the line removed and switch to mobile  may only give 3-4Mpbs but it is consistant 24/7. Anyone who moves to BT is insane (self included)~~~,Spennymoor~~~,2014-11-19~~~,1,1,1,1
"The worst company I've ever dealt with:- incompetent staff - unreliable speeds - unreliable wifi connection (the signal continually drops) I've raised the issue of the unreliable wifi connection and been told the wfi signal is ""not guaranteed"". I've been with BT for as long as I can remember but all I can say is the company is now in free fall. Would not recommend.~~~",London~~~,2014-11-19~~~,1,1,1,1
I would love say something nice about BT  but i'm using a Mobile Dongle to write this as they STILL haven't got my internet set up after failing to show up TWO WEEKS AGO. We had to book our appointment for today but as expected  they didn't come. I don't know why  they can't tell me why. They even tell me I have to wait 2 more days for a person to come down  to do it now. Useless company  useless customer service. Do NOT buy from this company  or you will just end up regretting it.~~~,~~~,2014-11-18~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Having been a BT customer since 2010 I have now got so fed up with their new customer offers that I have contaced them to cancel with the aim of moving to Plusnet and then returning in a year. However because I have a £1.31 discount till June 2015 they want to charge me £130 to leave - thats 10 years of the discount which in itself only lasts a year. So I asked to discuss it with a manager the call centre operative flatly refused to put me in touch with one - basically these are the rules take it or leave it. so I'm stuck with BT till June 2015 what a total Rip off~~~,Leyland~~~,2014-11-18~~~,1,1,4,4
Literally the worst company I have ever had to deal with. Their customer service team's only role is to delay you as much as possible until they fix the issue. They don't call you back  they pass you from one member to another so you have to keep repeating yourself. They make you repeat tests you have already done 5 times in the past day. The company can't keep a stable connection for more than 2 days at a time. DO NOT USE.~~~,~~~,2014-11-18~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is the slowest broadband service out there. Anyone reading this please heed this advice (Or you'll regret it). AVOID at ALL costs. I used to be on TalkTalk a few years ago in my old home and my internet connection was 54Mbps. With this 54Mbps broadband I was getting seriously good browsing speeds. Not only was I getting good browsing speeds  but streaming live video content  like sports etc  was effortless. I was also able to download torrent files at a rate of 2Mb/s. I judge how good/fast my broadband is by Peer to Peer (P2P) speeds. Fast forward 3 years and I have moved home and changed ISP. Switching is the biggest mistake I EVER made. I am on the Unlimited broadband package; and am getting a 144Mbps connection (Over twice what I was getting on TalkTalk). Strangley; my internet browsing is super Sloooooow  watching a Youtube video takes about 2-3 minutes to load and keeps freezing  so I have to keep refreshing. My torrent download speeds are maxed out at 700kbs (Over 3 times slower than with TalkTalk).~~~,Doesn't Matter~~~,2014-11-17~~~,1,3,1,1
I thought BT was a premier supplier we what a disappointment. Suffered 4 months of poor service after numerous calls engineers working on i still have a problem. Basically the product is not fit for purpose and you have to pay extra to sort their faulty product. Stay well away from BT~~~,Blackburn~~~,2014-11-17~~~,1,1,4,1

how can bt say they have fibre optic when the cables they laid many moons ago was not fibre optic unlike virgin who have laid fibre optic hence how virgin are able to have fast broadband speed bt only have a little bit of fibre optic running from the big green box somewhere near your house then they fit another tiny bit of fibre optic into your house but the bit in the middle is not fibre optic so it can only be as good with what's there 2 good bits at the end won't make the bit in the middle any better because its not fibre optic because they have never dug up old cable to replace it with fibre optic so there for bt are fooling you all and should be taken to trading standards for false advertisement  think about it people don't get ripped off by these fat greedy cats~~~,England~~~,2014-11-17~~~,1,1,1,1
worst customer service ever had. I was set up twice by the bt engineers and installation date was changed without letting the client know.Had spend hours on phone with them but seems they didn't actually care.~~~,manchester~~~,2014-11-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
DON'T make the mistake of choosing BT fibre optic 2 (not like the advert!) - mine runs like a snail and I am told you can only get super fast if ethernet connected and no other devices??? That's certainly not what they advertise!!They don't want to know you once they've ''hooked'' you into the 18 month contract (at £28 per month)!!! Seriously look around  but avoid this mess I've got!~~~,derbyshire~~~,2014-11-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Completely useless avoid like plague.  We arrange to swap to infinity it doesn't work And I work at home so will be billing them for loss of earnings and a refund on time without it.  You have to wait a day to book a call to test it BEFORE an engineer gets involved.  t.......ers~~~,Birmingham~~~,2014-11-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful company  terrible communications  don't respond to email complaints  didn't send out equipment  never checked installation  have charged me for a free service  despite me telling them several times I don't even want that service  charged twice for equipment  just a mess. Never get to talk to the same person  broken promises of resolution. Their hub stopped connecting to my PC after 20 mins  not any better signal than Virgin. Seriously  if you like good customer service  best just to avoid.~~~,Wiltshire~~~,2014-11-13~~~,1,1,2,2
All I wanted to do was move house and take my telephone and broadband with me - Sounds simple  well it was until I had to change my moving in date.Phoned BT up and spoke to India  said I needed to change my moving date but Bless them  turned out they only changed the installation date and not the cut off date at my old property. Found out when first my broadband went and then the telephone. Had to then use my mobile to call them up but for some reason I couldnt have my broadband back  so for almost a month on dongles. Three  months later I think I've got my £130 charge for moving refunded but will have to watch this space.~~~,Hailsham~~~,2014-11-13~~~,1,1,4,2
My experience over a number of years has been in short a very very very bad one with BT. Lies  poor service and that's putting it nicely  slow speeds  faults that take months to fix while being fed lie after lie by people who are not qualified to be in a position to provide tech advice or support. BT senior management are a joke and in my opinion a waste of our money. This isn't a problem that affects few it is massive and has been going on for years. BT don't bother with them they are your worst nightmare  don't lets get going on BT India support  why not just take my money BT and kick me in the balls cos that's what your doing to 10000s.~~~,UK kent~~~,2014-11-13~~~,1,1,1,1
I ordered a BT infinity student deal for 9 months  at the time seemed perfect  short contract and quick speeds. However we had to wait 2 weeks for an engineer  this is normal  I would like to say that it is now 7 weeks after I orginally ordered their service yet I am STILL waiting for them to sort out our internet  and better still they have charged me £58 so far without providing anything! They have sent out 4 engineers who haven't been able to sort a supposedly simple process. Ive had 8 engineers booked  but 4 never showed up. I've spent countless hours on the phone to their terrible customer service who make false promises (I have actually heard unprompted promoises from them)  half of them don't even know what their talking about!  I'm now 7/11 weeks through my first semester at university where internet is very important  not only have BT had a detrimental effect on my study  they've caused my housemate and myself to run over our mobile phone data bills  I understand this isn't their direct fault  but there are somethings like checking university timetables and sending emails that are necessary  but where we are used to having our phones connected to WiFi  we're now running over our bills costing us more money. I thoroughly recommend you to not go for BT  yes every company has cases where things go wrong  but when things go wrong with BT  you're better off instantly switching provider. I am beyond angry with them.~~~,Bath~~~,2014-11-12~~~,1,1,1,1
"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE Phoned up BT to as I had a problem with my chromecast connecting to the hub  i knew what needed to be done to fix it  change the wireless band from 5ghz to 2.4ghz  was talking to the lady on the phone and she didnt seem to understand how the hub worked  i seemed to know more about it and she is a ""technician""  as I was asking her questions she couldnt answer she was beginning to not make sense  just saying anything that came into her technical head  she could not get off the phone quick enough and was very rude and not one bit helpful TERRIBLE!!!~~~",Ayr~~~,2014-11-09~~~,1,1,4,4

I have been a BT customer for 30 years. Recent problems started when they moved my email from Yahoo to BT. Weeks of problems accessing email and now lost access completely when trying to link email to my BT Id. Spent an hour on the phone with an engineer taking over my computer. Problem their end but he could not fix it. Complained by letter and tried the fix they suggested but still no joy. Now lost access to my BT account. Can log in using my BT id but it says because of technical problems they cannot show me my account details. Complained but no word yet when it will be fixed a week later. Of course the prices all go up in December. Now looking to leave BT. Have already moved to another email service provider. They seem to be spending all their money on TV sport rather than telecoms.~~~,"Colchester, Essex~~~",2014-11-08~~~,1,1,5,5
I have had numerous problems with BT over the last 20 years or so. Both phone and internet.I now have a situation where my phone is dead and my usual 2.4mbs download speed has reverted back to .75 mbs (yes point seven five!). BT have said there is a fault on the line and they say they plan to fix it within 3 days. They think this is acceptable. It isn't. They have also said they have tried to call me yet they know the landline is dead and my mobile hasn't rung or reported any missed calls. They lie basically. When the system is working it works pretty well but when it breaks they automatically assume you broke it.  Even when they grudgingly admit the fault is at their end they won't tell you what the problem is or how it got broken in the first place.Then they arrogantly tell me I'm booked in for a call on Friday (3 days from reporting the fault). Well if I tell them I'm going to book them in for a visit to their head office I doubt they would be dropping everything and cancelling their corporate days out in order to greet me. I won't be waiting for their call either. Especially as the phone isn't working! This is the most infuriating company I've ever had to deal with. It's automated systems are labyrinthine  it's customer care people lie to you  and it cares for nothing except it's profit margins. Appalling.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2014-11-06~~~,2,1,1,3

"BT have been offering a fantastic deal on broadband in our area  so we signed up and had our hub delivered.  No luck with installation so called the helpline who escalated the problem.  Another two calls later and an engineer was sent to the house. His first comment was ""there is no broadband in this area so I don't know why they keep sending me here"".  Don't you think BT would stop wasting people's time  its not rocket science.~~~",Newport~~~,2014-11-05~~~,1,1,1,1

Broadband speed is awful~~~,Reydon Southwold~~~,2014-11-02~~~,2,3,1,1
If it works  then it's fine but have had 15 weeks without service this year (so far). Most of that was due to a phone line that was broken between two posts. At the moment  the broadband comes and goes. When it's gone  BT start by asking what I've changed - or implying fault in my wiring. Miraculously  without my doing anything in the house  broadband comes back on. Failures usually coincide with work at the local phone exchange; where one genius cut the line to our property  because 'He thought it was unused. They need some technical help.~~~,N.

"2 months ago I've moved in  started with a normal DSL pack after a month I saw that it was very slow so I upgraded to BT Infinity 1  the speed tests continue with the same download speed and upload speed  4 days ago  there was an planned outage in my area to ""upgrade"" the speed of my connection  so I've called BT since I had no internet since the morning  they said there was a planned outage until the next morning  2 days passed and still no internet  called BT there is still a planned outage going on.... next day called again  for my surprise the planned outage was over and I had no internet so after 30min they opened a case to escalate to the 2nd line team  witch called in the morning so was fast  the guy called me (today) to check if there was still no internet  which I confirmed  after 5 minutes he calls me back saying that there is a problem and they need to send an engineer  next available date 10 November  so  after 4 days with no internet because of a 'planned outage' I still have to wait more 10 days for an engineer... to come and check my house.. which was good before the planned outages  me as a new customer I'm really disappointed with this type of service  expertise and customer service  as soon as possible I will definitely change to another provider.~~~",Exmouth~~~,2014-11-01~~~,1,1,1,1
What BT don't realise is the younger generation growing up with mobile technology.  In 20 years tops they will all be out of a job  hopefully  because they will not want landlines.  With mobile companies giving 10gb of data  they won't want bt crap or the crap they spurt out at you.I hope I'm still here so l can laugh at them like they laughed at me when l took my contract out.1 mile away they have 35mb yet l still paid the same price for 100kb if l was lucky. BT are just con men who should be reimbursing people who can't get what the bt site says. According to bt website today 1st November 2014 l should get between 1 and 3.5mb. Total bollocks. Lying 2 faced shots.  STROLL ON THE DEMISE OF BT.~~~,Wilton near Pickering~~~,2014-11-01~~~,1,1,1,1

"Keep clear of BT! I was with them years ago and their customer service was so poor I left for Sky. A couple of years ago I decided to give them another go. The speed and reliability was dodgy to say the least  so it wasn't really worth watching anything on TV so I decided to go back to Sky. I tried to cancel everything  but they only did one thing at a time so I have to phone separately to cancel TV  then Landline and Calls  then Broadband  then BT Sport. It was absolutely ridiculous and time consuming. Then after a month they tried billing me again  so I had to phone twice to get it sorted  which I was promised it now was. Then a month later I was billed again  so I phoned again and was promised it was again sorted. Then a month later  after cancelling my Direct Debit  they billed me again and tried to charge me a fee for not paying. Finally after 3 months and NINE phone calls  it appears that they have finally stopped stealing from me and attempting to charge me for a service that I don't have. I always give companies two chances and if they screw them both up I will never return and try my hardest to make all my friends and family never use them again. BT has now joined British Gas on the ""never use again"" list!~~~",Dundee~~~,2014-10-30~~~,1,1,1,1

I've been a BT customer for a while now  probably around two years  and I would definitely NOT recommend them to friends and family. Over the two years that I have been with BT I've had a number of problems with both internet speed  connectivity and rude staff. When I first got BT installed I had no problems at all. Then  after about a month  my internet speed plummeted and was barely usable. On one occasion it took 52 hours to download a 20GB file for a PS3 game that I was trying to play. On many other occasions I was left in a mess when my internet connection was so bad I could not even submit essays for University. When I first moved house  I was told that my BT services would be transferred and available to use by a particular date. On this date  I waited until 10pm for my phoneline to be connected but did not have a broadband connection. I waited until the following day  thinking maybe there was some kind of delay. Three days later  I still had no broadband connection so made a phonecall to see what was happening. At first I was told that I did not have a broadband deal associated with my account. I told the operator that there must have been some kind of mistake  explained the situation and was told it would be dealt with within 48 hours. After 48 hours I still had no broadband and was relying on mobile internet (in a VERY poor coverage area) to send/receive emails. I contacted BT again and was told that there was no record of my broadband service. I explained the situation and  again  was promised action within 48 hours. ANOTHER 48 hours passed and no broadband connection appeared. I rang to complain again and ask what was happening  this time to be told that when I changed address I had removed the broadband option from my account. This was NOT the case  why would I get rid of my broadband? At this point I was told that a BT operative would look into the matter and get back to me. When I received a phonecall the following day  I was told that my broadband service was still active at my old address and had not been moved to the new address with my phoneline. I was confused and angry at this point and demanded something be done. I was told that the only course of action was to place a new broadband order which could take up to 14 days to put into place. I had no choice but to accept and waited for my order. Due to an unknown problem  it took 21 days for my connection to be installed and  once it was installed  it did not work. I had no broadband connection at all. During one of these phonecalls  after being on hold for 18 minutes  I was talking to an adviser when she put the phone down for no reason and I was forced to ring back and wait in a queue for a further 25 minutes. I made over 20 phonecalls to BT to get this sorted and  after nearly another week  my broadband connection was working. For the next few months I had a slow internet connection  sometimes slower than dial-up  and was told by friends and family that they could not get through to my landline number at times. Eight months later  I moved house again. I was told that my broadband and phone service could be transferred to the new address without a problem. However  after going through the process  I was given an engineering appointment that was two weeks after I moved in. Realising there was nothing I could do about this  I waited for the appointment. I then received an e-mail stating that it was going to cost £130 on top of my normal bill to get my services transferred to the new address. This brought my bill for that month up to £210. Another obvious problem here was the cost of my bill before service charges. For the last year I have not received a BT bill for an amount less than £60 when it should only be £40. I've questioned this and was told it was because of my phone usage. I should get free evening and weekend calls but  as I can see clearly on my bill  I have been charged many times for evening calls. Sometimes up to £3 per call. Now  after nearly a month of living at my new address I have found that the slow broadband problem has followed me! Some days I get a solid 19MB connection  other days I'm lucky if I get a 1MB connection. For the past three days I have noticed my broadband connection has been particularly slow. So slow  in fact  that it takes roughly 20 seconds for a website to load and I have to let youtube videos buffer for 5-10 minutes before I can play them. Overall  BT have been a totally useless  terrible Internet Service Provider with bad customer service. The only reason I am still with them is because every time you move address your contract is automatically renewed for 12 months. As soon as my contract has ended I will be looking for a new ISP and warning everyone I know to avoid BT in the future.~~~,Measham~~~,2014-10-24~~~,2,2,1,1
Worse company to ever have any service from. had to check my bill monthly as I was being over charged. Customer service was awful. Would not recommend anyone to choose BT.~~~,United Kingdom~~~,2014-10-23~~~,1,1,1,1
broadband stopped working  took 2 months and lots of wasted time to get an engineer out  despite them admitting it was their fault. Having fixed it they then  without notifying  added £130 charge on to next bill for line improvements. They did remove it once I wasted more time going through their awful contact system. But whole process felt like corporate sharp practice and that they had put an awful lot of time into trying to design a system so they don't provide customer service if at all possible~~~,isle of mull~~~,2014-10-23~~~,1,1,1,1

I came from Tiscali which was bought out by talk talk the service went rapidly down hill 6 years. B.T have poached me away with a promise of excellent broadband and all the time it was they who refused to repair their systems. there is always the threat of pay for their repair personnel this wrong and ofcom should do something about this  the only systems outside of theirs is the router all else belongs to B.T we have been with B.T 39 years altogether  it is like others have already stated talk to your self when it comes to service. they were going to send me a new router 6 weeks ago still waiting! this company is so large they could not care less for their retail customers I doubt the trade customers fair much better as I Wrote  I was with talk talk I have come to learn it wasn't them. I have had 6 B.T engineers out fixing faults all outside of the house all within 12 months of their contract when the contract is up they will see the end of 41 years of a loyal consumer I will  throw all of their  equipment outside of the house. yes I know you can never get rid of them  but it will make me feel better Derek~~~,Berkshire~~~,2014-10-19~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I had been a customer of BT for a few years. Last year I suffered the slowest possible speed of any broadband ever. I contacted BT on numerous times and asked for a partial refund which they politely refused. Eventually they sent out an engineer to solve the problem so once my speed improved I decided to stay with them for another year and give them benefit of my doubt. Well from bad to absolutely awful ! Early September this year I decided to leave this so called organisation! I cancelled and got a MAC code to give to my new provider only to discover 1 month on BT are still charging me for something I do not receive. Despite numerous calls this continues so the ombudsman it is.BT have given me the worst customer service I have ever received and they blame this on my new provider apparently they never informed BT. Utter crap. BT I'd give you a zero if it were possible~~~,Surrey~~~,2014-10-18~~~,1,1,2,2
"Bad customer service - I have been tied into contracts with them for the last 4 years due to house moves and them renewing my contract every time I move. At one point they wrote to me asking if they minded if they cancelled my contract because someone else wanted to use the same number as me and when I called them and said I was happy for them to cancel the contract they then threatened to charge me a penalty of hundreds of pounds because cancellation of the contract would be 'my fault'!  I am now desperate to leave them and literally halve my bills for broadband and phone and they won't give me a MAC code to move my broadband.  Even requesting a MAC code from them takes ages as they are aggressive when you ask for it and you have to keep repeating ""please give me a MAC code"" for 20 minutes before they will even put in the request.  I am three days away from reporting them to OfCom.  I will never use BT again.~~~",Cambridge~~~,2014-10-18~~~,1,1,2,2
