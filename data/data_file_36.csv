"Useless support  MY Broadband along with telephoen has not been working for a week. An engineer wroked out thata cable was broken 210 metres from my property  but closed teh job as ""fixed""  When I chased  apparently Bt have been calling me on my landline - yes the one that is not working  to discuss the fault  and I am now told that they can not fix the problem because there is a problem in their data base with my address - even though an engineer has already made the diagnosis.. What a complete and utter waste of time~~~",Cardinham ~~~,2017-03-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Its a shame there is no option to give zero stars to BT.   What an utterly awful company to deal with! No internet for over 2 weeks now and every time I call its the same pointless process over and over again. They send engineers who never turn up  try to charge me for their failures and waste hours of my day every time I deal with them. Please do yourselves a favour and DO NOT USE BT for anything~~~,Dorking~~~,2017-03-08~~~,1,1,1,1
This is the worst Broadband / Tv package deal I  have ever owned. I have lived all over essex ( also in the wild wilderness) and received a must faster  reliable and pain free service. Please do not be fooled by the cheap price of a package deal. Save your money and use carrier pigeon  even an untraine done from leicester square as you will have more chance of that working than what BT are installing. Honestly the product / service / customer care / attitude towards a bad service is absolutely terrible.~~~,Brentwood~~~,2017-03-07~~~,1,1,1,1
I would NEVER recommend BT. They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. I have been dealing with a complaint from the moment I was mis-sold and misinformed at point of sale.   This complaint has been running for 4 month with having over 20 conversations with different people to then be told that I has been LIED to and to resolve the issue was give a poor £2 discount on my rate and a refund. I was then told that the discount no longer applied as the BT rates are going up (which proves that they have no customer loyalty) and that the refund that was MEANT to be credited to my future payments was also a lie. Every single word that has come from BT has been a lie and still now trying to resolve. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!~~~,London~~~,2017-03-07~~~,1,1,4,3
"Worst experience with a company on my 10 years in London! They are very disrespectful  untrustful  their staff are trained to be such a liars! We cancelled our service with BT because we were moving home and after they overcharged us charging another month and the cancel fee (which is fine). I called them at the same day that i was overcharged they did apologise saying the refund would be in my account in 10 working days  obviously didn't happen! My 9 months pregnant wife is trying to contact them  and after 25 minutes waiting on the line (which is normal) they answer her  the staff say a different history  put her on hold to check ""the case""  for another 30 min and turn off the phone! So  basically she needed to start everything again  explaining the "" case"" and the same thing happens over again! That's being happening for more than 3 weeks trying constantly. That's so disrespectful as every time you wait for almost an hour after listening a lie from their staff and finally turning the phone off through your face! This just make you feel sick! Basically we just gave up loosing sixty quid! Good luck with that BT ;-) Please do not ever trust them! Hopefully you will never need them help!  Kindest Regards   Daniel Franchini~~~",Hackney~~~,2017-03-07~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Worse experience with broadband ever!!!! 3month waiting for connection line. Promised conection date moved again. Very long wait for engineer visit.If had been given a choice would not had them as my provider  but its the only provider at my post code.~~~,Colindale~~~,2017-03-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely Abhorrent service  broadband cuts out repeatedly  customer service are rude and unhelpful and have no idea what they're doing. You get passed from pillar to post. Don't do it.~~~,Southampton~~~,2017-03-05~~~,1,1,1,1
No Problems with the broadband.Changed the terms 3 months in to contract upping the price.(annoying but they can do that) I invoked cancellation they cancelled it for the wrong date. apparently to cancel the cancellation it takes 24 hours. Sounds dumb and i have to call back to re -cancel. Sounds really dumb from a big firm like Bt.~~~,Manchester~~~,2017-03-05~~~,2,1,5,5
Having been a (overcharged against the market) customer of BT for 20 plus years  my 73 yr old mother has been told it is £30 to leave their broadband and phone service. And absolute disgrace  not in the terms and conditions when she joined  and pathetically explained as one part of BT has to charge another part of BT to disconnect at the exchange. This is effectively restrictive practice. An awful company that treats customers like numbers  not human beings. Avoid them at all costs. Not surprising that ofcom are forcing them to drop line rental prices  they will rip people off for as long as they can without legislation.~~~,Peterborough~~~,2017-03-05~~~,1,1,1,1
I am absolutely disgusted with the customer service at BT. 1 hour 4 minutes on the phone transferred to 5 different people to be told despite being within  my 30 day cancellation period due to price increase  that it doesn't stand as I have to give 30 days notice or transfer to another provider before the 30 days are up!! Which for me  according to the rather patronising customer service advisor  goes from the date of the email received on 8th Feb!! Apparantly I am tied in to a 24 month contract which still has another 11 months to run. I can honestly say I would have never agreed to this length contract as I am well aware deals change quickly along with better prices!! The customer service advisor within the cancellation team  (5th person I got transferred to!) came across as patronising and in the 18 years I've had a phone service I can honestly say I've never been more disgusted.  Roll on 11 months or the complaint being resolved so I can move to a provider that  offers good customer service and values its customers. I would never use BT or recommend them as a provider again.~~~,Mansfield~~~,2017-03-04~~~,1,1,2,2
Terrible service. terrible speeds. no plans to improve speeds in our area. 1/5*~~~,Glanvilles Wootton~~~,2017-03-03~~~,1,1,1,1
After leaving sky who have been very good for 7 years I decided to join bt for a change  15 days later from my turn on broadband date I still have no internet. When I call about 4 times daily they say we cannot get a engineer out for another 2 weeks. Never ever again please do not join bt it is the worst customer service I have ever experienced~~~,Liverpool ~~~,2017-03-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Bt is an absolute disgrace. They are dishonest and ripping people off. Our bills each month since June 2016 have been increasing. Last month they charged us £145 even though we had just moved into our new home and only had access to the internet for 2 weeks. Were a working couple with a toddler so not much time to be online when home. However  there have continually said we're going over. When I called them after they took the money they eventually said they made a mistake and would reimburse us £88 but we only got back £60 approx. This week we got a letter from them saying we can choose a new deal or had the option to leave. So we called them and they tried to tell us we can't  leave until we told them they sent us a letter. Our mistake was not looking at all the reviews online before agreeing to go ahead with bt. We won't make that mistake again.~~~,Derby ~~~,2017-03-02~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT for 7.5 years  3 years with fibre.  I am currently paying £36.63 for up to 38Mps  but actually get around 48Mps. Very occasionally there is a moment's break on the broadband  maybe just twice a month.  When I was having a recurrent problem loosing connection it was quickly remedied by the supply of a new router FOC. Overall I am very satisfied with the service.~~~,Norwich~~~,2017-03-02~~~,5,5,5,5
customer service is so rubbish  conecting from one department to another. phone cut and no 1 didnt called back. completelly unrespectible company 12m contract finish and never come back ! rubbish~~~,northampton~~~,2017-03-02~~~,1,1,4,1
Since people realised by now how bad BT' customers service & Broadband is  BT reinvented itself as Plusnet  which is as bad. The legal team is not able to show any existing clauses but will fight you on everything to scam you. In addition  when you choose to leave  Plusnet will not take your written notice but illegally charge you for an extra-month without any Services rendered. Plusnet will help themselves with your direct debit whilst providing the worst of broadband and landline services for the duration of the contract. If you complain  Plusnet ask for additional money to fix any issues (and not fixe them in any case...). Good luck!!~~~,London~~~,2017-03-02~~~,1,1,1,1
BT have dealt with me dishonestly. I contacted them for broadband fibre. They wrote a new 18 month contract and at the same time they changed my telephone package removing my original friends and weekend option. My account went from £64 to £227 in one month..now apparently it is my fault for not checking that they changed the calls without my knowledge. They are grossly dishonest and do not keep any records or record the reference numbers logged when you query them. They leave anything off that reflects badly on them. Disgustingly greedy without any concern for the customer...greedy money grabbers!!! Do not use them...never...ever!!!~~~,Dartford~~~,2017-03-01~~~,1,1,3,1
honestly. if you want internet slower than 56k moden then join Bt  they are seriously bad. i have no idea how they have lasted this long. painfully slow internet  nonstop disconnecting.~~~,london~~~,2017-03-01~~~,1,1,1,1
i'd rather jump off a bridge to my death then commend someone to use BT or Plus net. honestly the worst internet provider to have ever lived. just bad. Connection completely stops working and disconnects you every min after peak hours. you guys are an actual joke.~~~,london~~~,2017-02-28~~~,1,1,1,1
"I will say the broadband I have is as advertised  it's up to 52mbps and I get 50 and it's pretty reliable  might go down 2/3 times a week for a minute or so. It's always on so to speak  fast downloads and the router has been okay  but very poor wireless  it doesn't even go to the bedroom which is on the same floor as the router and roughly 5 meters away.   As a company they are awful  they put up their prices during your contract and you have to put up with it or cancel early and pay the rest off.I started with infinity 1 and lane line  it was about £35 a month  8 months later and it's now £50-£55 a month for no reason.  I asked them why it happened and they said all customers have to pay more in order for bt to spend more on the network maintenance and upgrades! They then tell me as I've contacted them  magically they can reduce my bill by £10 a month  what they didn't tell me is that buy agreeing to that I was entering a new contract so my 12 month contract is more like 18 months now and I'm still stuck with them for another 10 weeks!  I can get the same £50 a month service for a £25/£30 else where and will be doing so.  They all give you ""free"" stuff like BT Sport which later is not free  rather than cancel it for you they just add £5 a month to your bill. Here you go sir have this free tv package  it's £5 a month! It's like going to a pound shop and asking how much is this? Scammers.~~~",Kent~~~,2017-02-27~~~,2,3,5,4
I got stuck with BT as I was moving city (and house) so got caught in there ever renewing contract (to avoid cancellation charges). They messed up the connection on every move  in one instance trying to disconnect our new neighbours. The complaints department is beyond a joke  at one point demanding I close the complaint because it had reached their self appointed time to deal with it  which they hadn't done. Finally they've tried to charge us £80.00 for cancelling the contract after they put their prices up  in direct breach of the ofcom regulation stating otherwise.~~~,Derby~~~,2017-02-27~~~,1,1,1,1
Customer service is absolutely atrocious!  It has just taken me almost an hour to change from an extremely inflated monthly payment to a bill for each month. The guy in the call centre just didn't seem to understand what I wanted even though the previous call handler and I  explained clearly what had to be done. Going now for a lie down and a cuppa~~~,Belfast~~~,2017-02-27~~~,1,1,4,4
For the sake of your own sanity  DON'T JOIN them!!!!!! We joined 6th January only to receive a call one week later that they are cancelling our order and apparently we requested it. Called them back to find out we have to wait a week for another engineer who then said it will not work for additional 10 days!!!  10 days later nothing. Called them again telling them we want to cancel the contract. We've been told to wait another 3 days for a call from their complaint team to sort it out. Hours on the phone with India for nothing. Save yourself a lot of time and join someone else who actually cares about their customers..~~~,London~~~,2017-02-24~~~,1,1,1,1
We were promised a 3-7.5 mbps for our broadband i am preety sure we have never reached that since we moved here. You definetely can't rely on this broadband + i tried to reach them through phone a couple of times which they never answered(both times i stayed on the line for more than 10 minutes.~~~,London~~~,2017-02-24~~~,1,1,1,1
PLEASE AVOID BT!!!I recently moved house and planned on moving my broadband package too  BT cancelled and lost my order on several occasions.  They kept putting installation dates back.  I feel completely messed about.  Their customer service team is woeful  no harm to their Asian team but they haven't a clue and can't understand English  it took 30mins on one occasion just to confirm who I was!!  Seriously avoid BT  they have no respect for customers.~~~,Portadown~~~,2017-02-24~~~,1,1,1,1
DO NOT SIGN UP TO BT!! THEY ARE THE WORST COMPANY WITH HORRENDOUS CUSTOMERS SERVICE! Signed up everything in March 2016  they lost the order which all bank details were given so didn't start until June! Broadband was terrible! Constantly dropping out! Every call went to an Indian contact centre and lasted around 4 hours! Made a complaint which took 4 months to resolve and the resolution was they couldn't resolve the bad Internet but would continue to charge top price every month. Finally I heard from Sky that due to price rises in April I was allowed to leave early. I rang and cancelled in a shot and went back with Skype who I was with 15 years  had fantastic service but BT claimed to have faster Internet.~~~,Newcastle ~~~,2017-02-24~~~,1,1,1,1
Renewed my broadband TV and phone package after a 12 month discount package and overjoyed to be offered the same package for a further 18 months. Free phone calls 24/7 - full BT sports package and even sent the latest hub. Well informed about the small price increase-great service A1 all round*****.~~~,Hartlepool~~~,2017-02-23~~~,5,5,5,5
Broadband speed: rarely reaches speed exceeding 5mbps.Customer service: no answer. called 2 times and after 15 minutes I decided to hang up.Broadband reliability: Not only the speed does not reach the figures promised  it is not even stable.~~~,London~~~,2017-02-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Cheaters  liars  DONT EVER SIGN THE CONTRACT WITH THEM!!! Prices increases service going down! Complete rubbish~~~,Wattstown~~~,2017-02-22~~~,1,1,1,1
BT are absolute trash  toilet paper  clowns  rubbish and thieves! Constant price hikes  poor customer service  (no disrespect to the asians as it is not their fault english is not their first language). Connection speed is good cant complain between 50-65mb on an estimated upto 75 mb package. I was originally paying £45 per month for a 12 month contract  which went up to £55 within the 12 month period. After the 12 month contract period I as vex and wanted to go with someone else  yet BT convinced me to stay as they would reduce my bill to £33 if i took on another 12 month contract. This I did but guess what? Yep within just 2 short months price went up to £42  then £44 to now it £55. STAY WAY CLEAR OF BT you have been warned.~~~,Leicester~~~,2017-02-22~~~,1,1,5,1
Chose BT as my first internet provider when i moved into my first house  and the entire experience has been terrible. It took BT three weeks  with three separate engineers to set up the service. When I rang up customer service  I had to go through around 15 minutes of an automated phone call requesting every single possible detail before i was finally put through to a person (who was then only reading from a script  with no knowledge of the product anyway). Then when i moved house six months later  I was charged £130 to switch my broadband to my new address (which was a two week wait  for someone to come and plug a device into my wall  and then leave). Upon leaving BT  i receive an e-mail which states that i need to pay £20.38 for ending my contract early  even though it ended last month. I apparently also need to pay £31 for stopping my broadband. Obviously when i try to ring BT to sort this out  i am greeted with automated nonsense.  I am glad to see the end of my time with BT  and would advise everybody to stay away from a company which offers no customer service  and sends you extra charges for anything they can think of.~~~,Lancashire~~~,2017-02-22~~~,1,1,2,2
Usual story  shocking customer service. Recently rejoined BT after many years away and replaced Sky for phone  broadband and TV. Broadband usually ok but drops out for no reason making the TV unviewable. Have missed numerous shows that I like to record on Discovery and Nat Geographic channels. Seems to be every few days I have to go through rebooting everything to get it working  only to see the connections lost within minutes. Have had an engineer out to no avail and given a very long cable to hardwire the set top box to the router - an unacceptable solution as far as im concerned. Wish I had never binned Sky  particularly for BT who have demonstrated exactly why when I can finally extricate myself from their contract wont be seeing me as a customer again. Ever.~~~,Eastleigh ~~~,2017-02-21~~~,1,1,4,1
Never Use BT....Service is appalling and Internet/Broadband is terribly slow and constantly drops. Worst decision I made transferring to BT..cant wait for the contract to end so I can move back to a decent provider...never had any problems before I changed to BT~~~,Surrey~~~,2017-02-20~~~,1,1,1,1
I wanted to put minus one for overall satisfaction and customer service  but it isnt available.At present i m in the middle of a nightmare with BT  I decided to leave because of the price hikes  thats when the trauma began   letters   texts  and emails ensued  5 in a week  3 calls to disconnections and customer care   getting no further  cancelled direct debit so I can control what they are asking for I have tried to cancel sport 6 times over the last few months  3in the last 18 days  no one does it   wrote a letter to managing director customer care  block capital across the top I AM NOT PAYING £110 fee for early release of contract and CANCEL SPORT.This morning letter from the Libby Barr  manager  thanking me for my order of BT Sport!!!rang again  now. they tell me another account was opened. In my name I didnt open it   so who did? They dont know   theres only me so  its not at my end.They say i ll get a bill in the next 7-10 days saying what I owe them   then I LL have to ring billing to sort it out -customer care???Incompetence  rudeness  agression  confusion  and being pressured is what I ve had from BT  DONT  even think about joining them I might of thought about rejoining in the future   but I d rather be without services now BT ARE A JOKE !~~~,Barnsley~~~,2017-02-20~~~,1,1,2,2
First week of switching from sky to BT i regret that ive done it so much  service was on for 4 days and then it cut off  contacted technical of BT 4 days ill have to be without broadband and land line  even though switch over date was 4 days ago. Would not recommend them. Unfortunately virgin is not available in our area.~~~,London~~~,2017-02-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Just cancelled my broadband and found that I have to pay £31 disconnection fee  disgusting. BT never mentioned this fee when I moved to then. I am sure they never mention this as customers will be put away. It is a disgrace to charge something like this at the end of the contract.Shame on them.Will never use them again.~~~,London~~~,2017-02-18~~~,1,1,3,2
"It ought to be illegal to describe 2BMit as ""broadband"".~~~",Telford~~~,2017-02-18~~~,1,3,1,5
the worse service I ever received. I got charged for over 1 year for a contract that I cancelled. £44.99 a month for 13 months I kept paying even though I  was told that the contract is cancelled and that I don't need to do anything. I urge everyone to stay away from BT. the service was very slow and was charged over £600 for a service that I clearly cancelled.~~~,Dagenham~~~,2017-02-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely shocking. I'm on Infinity 56meg  rarely ever see those speeds. Furthermore  we live in a 2 bed terraced house and signal drops in and out if we're further away from the router. The customer service is useless  you'll be waiting for an hour just to speak to someone who doesn't have a clue what they're talking about. They also throttle speeds (whether they'll admit it or not). At 5.02pm every day  the speed will drop through the floor and remain shaky for the whole evening.  We're lucky that they've just tried to increase prices mid-contract (I don't know how that's an acceptable way to do business)  this means we're allowed to break contract and move to another supplier. If you're thinking of moving to BT  don't. We were on Sky before which was reasonable but that was just standard broadband. Everyone that we've spoken to on Virgin Fibre has said it's fantastic. Pay a little extra and avoid the issues we've had.~~~,Nottingham~~~,2017-02-17~~~,1,1,1,1
Joining the club of BT frustrated customer .!!!Nothing to add to the other reviews . I am so shocked how a British company like BT Trap the customers   being rude to the customers and hang up the phone for a mistake done by BT.I have forwarded the complaint along with these reviews to Ombudsman Communications .Libby Bar   be proud of your worst customer service team   I bet they are following their leader .~~~,"Ashford , Kent ~~~",2017-02-16~~~,1,1,1,1
