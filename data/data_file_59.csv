The worst company I have ever had the misfortune to have to deal with. From day one the asked us to take a day off work so they could set the new install up for us then the hub came in a box we had to set up ourself. Not had a day with a good internet speed most below.04 of a Meg we pay for up to 17 meg and was told we should get around 7. They arranged for an engineer to come out so we booked another day off work  and no engineer turned up  called them and they said it's ok it's fixed itself. Over the next hour the Internet has cut out 4 times I've been told it's my pic tv etc that must be at fault. When I was with virgin they set it up for us  then if there was a problem it was fixed really fast  but 6 months down the line I still have no internet have to leave the phone unplugged so the Internet works ( so the fee for the land line is a bit of a rip off also) and the outcome of every complaint is it my equipment is all broke ~~~,Nelson~~~,2015-10-26~~~,1,1,1,1
"Switched from Sky as fed up of being constantly surcharged for not having a Sky box .Quite happy at the start with BT but not totally reliable constant speed drop outs but arrogant customer service  with a how dare I even think about moving ! attitude.Lots of delay tactics contact engineer contact cancellations.I got totally miffed with them so coughed up £100 early cancellation charge with all the delay tactics & unfortunately Gwyneth who got shirty with me when her every question ie ""You need to speak to faults so we can improve our service to you"" was answered every time with ""I'm not interested"" Woe betide any body speaking to them after 1800 GMT as they speak in hyroglifics through a crackly phone line. Plus they charged me £150 for a faulty socket.So farewell BT & bog off as I am off to the fur coat & no knickers operation that is Virgin Media.~~~",Ipswich~~~,2015-10-25~~~,2,1,3,2
Ober the years Ive tried many different services and providers. I rank Talk Talk as the absolute worst. NTL put me off ever trying Virgin. The absolute vest customer service without a shadow of doubt is O2 which I have at a 2nd address. BT attracted me with the sales pitch and the free wifi but in truth its not as transparent as O2 and neither has it the support. I dont want to knock yje firm when they dont deserve it but I see little in the way of good news staying long term . I will however persevere a bit longer.~~~,South Wales~~~,2015-10-24~~~,2,2,3,3
First experience with BT - oh dear! After calling to find out why downloads were only running at .383Kb when the line tested at 7.9Mb I discovered that their 'BT Desktop Help' does not work with Windows 10. Love chat then took 20 minutes to connect after showing a wait time of 4 minutes and when I conversed with the agent their use of English was poor and their technical knowledge almost zero - I was even asked at one point to delete a Windows system file. A follow-up call established that they already knew about the Windows 10 issue but again the agent was difficult to understand. I was asked to reset the router with no regard to interruption to online services that were currently running - and all this on the same line that has worked without problems for 12 months with another provider using the BT infrastructure. Appalling.~~~,Devon~~~,2015-10-24~~~,3,1,1,3
Cant really comment on speed and reliability as I am trying to change from sky to bt   but they way I was treated by the customer service people I am now in two minds. The appear to thing everyone knows everything about computers  tv`s and the packages they offer  I only wanted a bit of advice  but it may be that bt are making too much money to worry about customer satisfaction   ah well sky will be happy~~~,North Manchester~~~,2015-10-23~~~,2,1,3,4
Absolute rip off.  Expensive for terrible internet speeds.  They charged me an extra £5 without contacting me and added BT Sports onto my account  which I had to go through an hour of talking to non english people to get a refund on it! Prices then went up without allowing me to leave my contract. Threatened with a fee of £130 to move my internet when I rented elsewhere OR sign into another 12 month contract at a higher price. So now I am stuck with this company for yet another year! Stay well clear .. No value for money whatsoever.~~~,Haywards Heath~~~,2015-10-21~~~,1,2,1,4
My boyfriend and I just moved in to a new flat and while waiting for our BT broadband to start  we are using a BT Wifi with Fon hotspot. I have to say it's really not a good start  and I really hope the wifi we get will be better. The hotspot connection cuts about every 10 minutes  and we have to constantly reconnect to it. I work from home and need internet for my job  and this has been an absolute nightmare. Really not worth paying the £20 for 5 days  as I end up having to go out to an internet café to be able to work anyways. Really not a good connection speed or reliability.~~~,Manchester~~~,2015-10-21~~~,1,2,1,1
Well where do i start  i upgraded from standard brandband to fibre and since day 1 i was only getting standard broadband speeds i contacted bt customer services and they said there was a fault in my area please wait 14 days  i phoned again after 14 days as i was still getting standard speeds of 6mb and they said the fault had been fixed and i have said it wasnt so you they said they then found another fault that will be fixed in 7 days  7 days past my broadband speed was still 6mb instead of fibre so i phoned them again and they said it was fixed so i have now told them i am refusing to pay until it sorted and 3 months later of being haggled for a £500 bill daily by there billing team the fault team contacted me and said they have found the fault unfortunately my landline does not support fibre broadband speeds it took them 5 months to find this out? And as i was paying £79 for there biggest fibre a month i will recieve a credit on my account as i was only getting £14 a month standard broadband and they will switch me to this tariff and after 6 months off all this hassle they finally gave me a credit of the 5 months fibre which was £32!!!! How did they work this out? Absalutely terrible company i will not be using bt again and would deffinately not recommend them.~~~,salisbury~~~,2015-10-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Where do I start? Firstly it would help if the staff you speak to at customer services could understand English. I spent a considerable time on the phone trying to explain to a gentleman that I was unable to access my BT mail account as it kept telling me that it didn't recognise the details. Neither could I access any BT hotspots for wifi as again it wasn't recognising my details. Lastly I explained how unhappy I was that BT had reduced my payments to such a low level that I was now in debt to them. The gentleman explained how to fix the problems with my email and BT hotspots and assured me that my direct debit would be set to the amount that I requested. Two months later.......still no access to BT hotspots  still unable to change the primary email details  still unable to get my BT mail details accepted and still paying far too little on my direct debit meaning BT are once again hicking  it up to a completely unacceptable level to recoup the money I owe them.......I am NOT amused!~~~,Gloucester~~~,2015-10-19~~~,2,1,1,4
Had BT Infinity 2 for the last year and haven't had any problems. My installation was a different matter and after moving house  took almost 2 months to get a working installation. I found the Mumbai call centre to be useless and they were the first to ever be shouted expletives at! I found that complaining on the BT Facebook page is your best bet. Fill in the page you are given a link to and the brilliant team in Northern Ireland will help to get you a decent service. They even phone you at convenient times and deal with you like a human being. In short my service has been amazing ever since. The BT bill is large but you get what you pay for I suppose!~~~,Staffs~~~,2015-10-19~~~,4,4,5,4
I have tried and ordered a BT package with line and internet.with a visit from an engeeneer betwin 8-1p.m.I was stressing if it was possible to get at early as possible as i had to somewhere else by 1.Guess what never bothered to turn up or contact me.Customer service (I believe in India)useless.I thought for a premium service that you pay you do get it.Unfortunately just expensive with no service.Done with BT.Get a cheaper one for same or better service.~~~,London~~~,2015-10-19~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
BT Broadband is totally useless !! It's a COMPLETE RIPOFF !! Useless Technical Support. I have had 3 BT HUBS & none of them have worked properly. I have had ENDLESS MISERY for the last 14 Months. My last BT Bill was £48.23 which is totally extortionate !!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND BT TO ANYONE !!! I am in the process of switching my ISP & telephone to one that is much cheaper and extremely more reliable !! BT IS ONE TO AVOID AT ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!

BT have been superb over the past 18 months. Customer service and product has been second to none. Getting 36mbps. On fibre and the connection hasn't dropped once. Better than Sky and EE broadband.~~~,pontefract~~~,2015-10-17~~~,5,5,5,5

Bt is a terrible internet provider. It's okay when it's working but when it's not it can take upwards of 3 weeks for someone to even consider fixing it. If you call them you get through to someone in India who often cannot tell you the problem or lies to you. It's the worst internet provider available~~~,Wales~~~,2015-10-16~~~,1,1,1,1
We have had nothing but trouble BT Broadband and Phone. We have it in our holiday home and every time we come there is a fault. In July when we came we had been disconnected for no other reason than to put a new line for the van next door. Over three weeks it took them to put the line back on  by which time we had to leave. We came back this week and there is still a fault  we are having to use the hotspot. Every time we phone it takes a week for them to respond. We had a bad response from customer complaints it took over a month on the phone before we could get any compensation for loss of use. Can't wait till Christmas for the contract to run out and try some other company. If we could score zero stars thats what they would get from us.Harry  Banks Southport~~~,Southport~~~,2015-10-16~~~,1,1,1,1
If things are going well it's OK..BUT when things go wrong you've got a problem! On the technical side the Indians can only sort things up to a certain level but they don't know that keep plugging away and get frustrated...and so do you! On plans and billing if there's a mistake the call centre staff can't get their head round the complexities of the plans. I signed up for a BT Sport plan avoiding the £5 charge by signing up for an additional 12 months. I was then sent a letter to say I would be charged. Phoned and told I was definitely on the 'no play' plan. Bill arrived I had been charged. Phoned again  was told it would be rectified- it wasn't. Phoned again-told it would be rectified -we'll see! Call centre staff are lovely but they can't understand and/or rectify the errors.~~~,West Wales~~~,2015-10-15~~~,2,2,2,3
Being charged for Engineer call from my line. Yes  really! Shockingly bad. No broadband available from my line and no refund for line rentals. Broadband fault booked 4 times. First engineer no show. second engineer was a line engineer altho a broadband fault  could do nothing. third engineer the same. Forth Engineer was a broadand engineer and confirmed that no broadband available as too far from exchange. Whole thing took over 2 months to resolve. BT are refusing to honor promise to refund line rental as they say the line was used to make a call. The paper bill requested arrived this morning and I've been charged for the engineers call to BT's automated line test center in Derby. 50 seconds  27p the number is 01332758773. And on that basis a refund has been refused. Have you been charged for an engineers call. Check your bill! Got broadband via a mobile device from a well known mobile company. THE SAME DAY! It works too.~~~,Minehead~~~,2015-10-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Still confused as to how these guys have any customers at all. I have the misfortune of dealing with BT professionally and personally. Both experiences equally tragic. They are 100% incompetent  they lie and the customer service provided is not only Pharisaical but quite stressful and a complete waste of time. The speed is rubbish  often dropping and very very slow. It took them 3 weeks to take the line over from EE when we switched in our home  An engineer failed to show twice and in total we were without internet for 6 weeks and the hours spent on the phone makes me feel so angry.the converstaion during which i finally told them to cancel the contract took 1 hour and 13 minutes. eventually when we cancelled altogether after weeks of lies and no shows sky had internet sorted within the week. Shocking  below sub standard joke of a company. Id advise anyone thinking of using them to steer clear and well clear!~~~,london~~~,2015-10-15~~~,1,1,1,~~~
THEY SHOULDN'T EVEN GET 1 STAR! BT are pathetic they have given us just problems since we bought their services. We have no wifi so my son cannot complete his GCSE'S. BT took down any wifi we had! Our 3G bill is through the roof! We have no way of receiving any information via the internet. The contact service was useless none of them knew what they were doing and we couldn't understand them! Very angry strongly recommend you don't go with this service.~~~,Knutsford~~~,2015-10-14~~~,1,1,1,1

I tried to get Broadband through BT  firstly infinity to premises and then ordinary broadband. Infinity was sold to me and promised to be as quick and easy as copper line bb. I waited 3 weeks for an engineer  he turned up and said the road was too dangerous to work on  and they would require traffic management. Was advised by BT to cancel original order and to get a copper line telephone and bb installed. Promised it would be done on the 24th September. No engineer turned up  when l called BT to ask what had happened they said the order has problems with the exchange.  After weeks of endless calls to and from BT and going round and round in circles with no answers from BT  l have now cancelled the order and am hoping another provider will be able to supply us with BB. BT is an unhelpful and useless company selling products they can not provide. l would NOT recommend this company to anyone.~~~,Surrey~~~,2015-10-13~~~,1,1,1,1
here goes 24 july moved to new address.No phone line till 20 August No broadband till 1st september.BT wanted a bill for £107 ! still trying to work out why.Broadband speed less than 1 meg (this is on infinity 1) to this day still not right.Over 30 phone calls to india i might as well phone saturn have more chance of getting anything done.Call centres a complete waste of time they do not talk to each other i have to relive the nightmare over and over everytime i ring.Groundhog day!.I have a solution to the problem  i think i will take a 3year telecoms course and at the end of it try and fix my own broadband.please please please do not get your broadband off BT you WILL live to regret it.Bring back dial -up its quicker than BT.~~~,chorley ~~~,2015-10-12~~~,1,1,1,~~~
Absolutely appalling service. Ordered a new phone line and broadband infinity for a house move and it all went wrong from there. Incorrect order placed on their end  15 hours + on the phone trying to resolve the issue. Inability to speak to the same person twice  each person giving me different versions of the truth  temporary broadband premium at the old address given for '4 weeks' until the move - had it for a week and now being charged £860 for 'cancelling the order early' even though we never ordered it and are being accused of agreeing to pay for a two year broadband contract in two houses  one of which we left two months ago. Being given false information about the cloud and expecting more 'cancellation charges' while trying to sort it. Over 2 hours on the phone again today with a woman from India who made me spell Sarah 3 times and refuses to allow the charges to be dropped  insisting that we were more than willing to pay 2 years of broadband for 4 (1) week(s) worth. And that's is cutting the story short. Absolutely appalled by the despicable service of everyone at bt. Not a single person I spoke to appears to know what their job is. My advice is to avoid Bt like the plague. They have the worst customer service skills and common sense that I have ever had the displeasure to deal with.~~~,Bordon~~~,2015-10-12~~~,1,1,3,2
Please don't waste your time with BT.  It has been 2 1/2 months since we ordered broadband.  I have had to chase them at every point. You repeat your story over and over  and no one has the authority to do anything  but pass you on to the next department.  They are full of empty promises.  CHECK YOUR BILLS! They most likely have billed you for everything that they so kindly said they would minus off.~~~,Hearne~~~,2015-10-10~~~,1,1,1,1
"my phone line and broadband were supposed to go live on 08/10.it did not happen. The phone is dead and the broadband keeps dropping. I called on 09/10 and was told there was a problem with the previous supplier not ""releasing"" my phone number but that it would be fixed by midnight that day. It still does not work. So  I called their helpline and after talking to an advisor for quite some time and being told to plug and unplug things  it was still the same. Then he said he could send an engineer but it might cost me £129 pounds if something was wrong with my equipment. This worked perfectly 3 days ago with the other provider  so  I don't think so. I said no thanks and put the phone down as he was not easy to understand. I then went on their chat line  and halfway  through the conversation  got disconnected. i tried again and was told that there was already an ""expert"" working on it and also an engineer booked to come to my house. I never agreed to that. any way was there an expert working on it or was it an engineer coming to me??I then said I wanted to leave BT  and he asked if he could call me. Of course he must have tried to call my landline because a few minutes later he asked  on the chat line  if I had another phone number!!He called and transferred me to someone else! This person went through the same rubbish all over again  so I said I wanted to leave BT  got transferred to another person who said I would have to pay £500+ cancellation fee although since being with them I have had no working phone and appalling broadband. But if I leave now  I'm in breach of contract! what about them being in breach of contract by not providing what I'm paying for!I then had to agree to an engineer coming to my house but not till the 14th. I told this advisor that I needed my phone as I am an OAP and expecting rather important calls from my solicitor. My mobile is not brilliant  and I told him so  so  he tried to sell me a £6 a month SIM card from BT!!! How would that make my mobile better? It also seems to be that only if I am without service for 10 days will I get any refund on my subscription. That's a bit rich considering I have had no service on the phone line from the start!~~~",Worksop~~~,2015-10-10~~~,1,1,1,1
After 2 years of Infinity where the speed has dropped from 15 to 8mb  just got some brilliant news! 4G has arrived  55mb down  25 up. Shiny new 4g router works a treat. Soon all those dodgy cables will be melted down and those 'engineers' can get jobs in B&Q. Welcome to the future. Kiss goodbye to those jokers. I won't use EE or plus net either as owned by BT.~~~,Surrey~~~,2015-10-09~~~,1,1,1,1

I live in a well connected city and gave BT the benefit of doubt thanks to their new marketing. Having joined in May  by August they had still not provided the broadband I had been paying for. After many lengthy phone calls and empty promises assuring me it would be fixed  I finally cancelled (or believed I had!). Two months later they are still stealing money from my account for Services that I have never received. Hearing myself up for another lengthy phone all to a foreign call centre.... What ever you do...don't do it!! Talk talk provided the service (as paid for!!) fully fitted and running within a week for less money :)~~~,Southsea~~~,2015-10-08~~~,1,1,1,1
I can't comment on customer service as in 4 years  I have never  ever had to call them.  The broadband has never been slow despite servicing a smart TV  2 smart phone  3 computers and a kindle.  It's never gone off-line ever.  Wish it was a bit cheaper though!~~~,Southampton~~~,2015-10-07~~~,5,~~~,5,5
Very first two weeks of my contract I was without internet or phone because they couldn't be bothered to send an engineer out to the outside pole. They were adament my connections were fine. After several calls to them they sent an engineer out telling me it was my error and I would have a hundred odd charge. Turned out my lines were still connected to previous occupants provider lines not BTs. Also have called several times and claimed 3 times for the marks and spencer vouchers I was owed with the deal. Six months later ... still no vouchers. I have had  3 emails to say im not entitles to sainsburys vouchers because I needed to apply online amd be a new customer????? I was a new customer and I DID apply online and im not applying for Sainsburys vouchers.  My deal was marks and spencers. Ive rang about this lots now. I Give up! I don't recommend them sorry.~~~,Gloucester~~~,2015-10-07~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Outstandingly bad overall. Poor broadband speeds  poor customer service. Fluctuating problems and cynical responses to complaints. Numerous 'fixes' for slow speeds but after a few weeks they just go down again.Email hopelessly unreliable - tried 67 times today to get to log in page  then was disconnected 9 times by error message claiming  I had asked to 'send another form' when I had done nothing but try to use the service. No attempt ever to tell customers if there is a known fault. No compensation. BT is due for a big scandal  surely. Eventually arrogance does not pay.~~~,Near Chippenham~~~,2015-10-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Changed to BT in May 2015 and was assured by BT Infinity Hub 5 was the best  total rubbish When on the internet my connection will just cut off for no reason  might only be for a short while but annoying when you trying to find someone. I have a brand new laptop so it cannot be the age of the equipment. I did contact customer services and they said no problem we can sort it out we can alter the speed for you and they then reeled off load of IT speak and said  yes now that is better  and it worked fine for about a week and now it is just as bad as ever. I did ask why  wasn't I given the higher speed at the start as I was playing for it  they could not answer that.Have no intentions of ringing again because you have to speak to someone in India who is totally useless and they are allowed to give you the company speak.  Sorry I ever decided to go with BT. Why are they allowed to get away with bad service.~~~,Yorkshire~~~,2015-10-06~~~,1,1,1,1
"Had a poor experience today.. In July my 82 year old mother wished to upgrade her internet to ""unlimited""  sadly she mistakenly updated (by phone) to ""unlimited Infinity 1 broadband""  which she definitely did not require since standard broadband speeds are fine where she lives in the south east of England. A friendly call to BT today to explain the honest mistake essentially fell on deaf ears since the contract ""14 day cool off"" period had expired. There is some dispute if my mother had received the confirmatory email from BT at the time  where we might have been able to rectify the mistake in time. As a result my mother is locked in to an 18th month contract and paying around £130 extra than she needed to over that period. BT tried to convince me to accept that the dispute was ""resolved""... which it certainly is not..I may or may not take this further with the ombudsman. The take home message is ...Technical aspects of computers can be rather confusing to some  I personally will be paying more attention to my mother's internet contracts in future.. I am with BT as well and have generally been happy with their service until now.. However because of their intransigence today I intend to take advantage of current offers from other providers ASAP...so they will lose me as a customer for a while.. what a shame you could not be more reasonable and flexible BT.. hence a poor rating from me.~~~",Wales~~~,2015-10-05~~~,2,1,3,3
I joined BT for the BT Sport.My phone line crackled  I had to buy a 15m ethernet cable as the Line Extenders did not work.I spent an hour on the phone to Calcutta only to be told the broadband was slow.Even with a Cat 6 cable the broadband was only 6 meg and the BT Sport was unreliable.  Simply do not bother with Line Extenders buy a cable! I wanted Sky Sports  but was told I had to upgrade to Infinity to get it for even more money. I posted everything back within the 14 days ans good job I had proof of posting as they kept saying they had not received it even though I had a tracking number saying it was delivered. Even though I only had the service 14 days I got a final bill for £136. I contested it and it was reduced to £106 then £58. Frankly I should be paying nothing for a dodgy phoneline I never used Interner a third of the speed promised and TV that barely worked even though I bought my own cable. I have gone back to Virgin as they are far better.~~~,Kent~~~,2015-10-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Dont trust BT ever. I contacted BT in 2013 when the exchange showed it was AO (accepting orders) here i am oct 2015 and still no Superfast. I have a case open with their own complaints and Ombudsman. I lost out on free internet deals on the promises and order i put with BT from other suppliers. They continually LIE and blame sub contractors for their own engineering g incompetence. A neighbour who placed. an order in August had his installed within 3  weeks..BT was given £90 000 000of tax payer money to ensure rural broad band roll out.. . I don't recommend them to anyone ever.~~~,Cornwall~~~,2015-10-03~~~,1,1,1,1
For the past 3 weeks I have had problems with my bt broadband dropping out. It had completely gone for a week. On calling BT on 15/10/15 I was told there was no problem with my line. I called back 10 minutes later when the broadband went done again  and spoke to an alternative advisor  who told me there was a deep problem with my line  and that an engineer would come out the following Monday. Having taken the morning off work and waited in from 8am to 1pm for my engineer visit  I then called BT to ask where the engineer was. It took me 40 minutes to connect to an advisor who told me there was no problem with my line and the engineer didn't need to visit. Wonderful that they didn't let me know that before I stayed in all morning. Only the problem has not been fixed. Having waited an hour to be put through to another advisor  who told me that a technical expert would be in contact in 48 hours. I have now received after 44 hours an email to tell me to check my connections and offering a paid for technical advise service - so far have spent about 2 and a half hours on hold  been passed from department to department  and still have broadband that cuts out. Having asked their complaint procedure I was told I would receive an email detailing how to complain - surprisingly it did not arrive. I cannot wait until my contract finishes  as I will under no circumstances renew with BT. Customer service is absolutely dismal and dealing with their advisors is frustrating and useless. Perhaps if I stop paying my bill  someone will contact me.~~~,lancashire~~~,2015-10-03~~~,1,1,4,2
Advertised as 17Mb  receive between 3 and 0.3. Comes and goes rapidly and unexpectedly. Phone up customer service? as soon as they realise that there is actually a problem with your line and you need help they hang up.~~~,"Newmarket, Suffolk~~~",2015-10-02~~~,1,1,1,1
My bt broadband has been so entirely unreliable that I cancelled it in favour of Virgin connection in mid October.  About fifteen days into my September bt monthly allowance I had received a message to say that I had used 80% of that allowance.  Broadband was unavailable for hours and sometimes days at a time.  The following day I received another message to say that I had used 100% of my September allowance.  Today I received an email to say that I had used 60% of my September allowance.  I should say I only use broadband for emails  occasional banking and looking up facts on the internet.  About fifteen minutes a day - nothing at all for the long  long periods when the middle light on the router is flashing.~~~,SW London~~~,2015-10-02~~~,1,1,4,1
