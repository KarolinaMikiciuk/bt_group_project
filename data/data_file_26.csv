Started a complaint over a year ago as our speeds are rubbish and connections often drop. Was told we needed fibre  so I went with that. Nothing changed. Fast forward to today  I have furnished Bt with proof that we never get anywhere near 35mbs (we get 12-16.7)  but they're only interested in going round in circles. Tried to take our service elsewhere  but the line is not able to be taken over! Bt have confirmed that we are out of contract  there is no legitimate reason why anywhere else says that we can't change.... useless. They sent me a smart hub but it makes no difference~~~,Cambridgeshire ~~~,2017-11-21~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Very slow broadband. Only had bt for 2 months cost so far over £150 it is useless at night and bt blocked me twice a waste of money~~~,CASTLEWELLAN~~~,2017-11-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Please be careful to not be mislead by BT's awful advertisement. Unlimited wifi minutes is NOT unlimited internet. 5 days in and weve racked up a massive bill and apparently we are not new customers so we have the privelidge of upgrading to a 49.99 package - twice as much as what we paid with TalkTalk. 5 days in and already feel ripped off undervalued and trapped.. Just counting the days till we can leave .. 359 i look forward to it~~~,birmingham~~~,2017-11-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Stay away they scam you with charges and then cut you off when you disagree and billing are so rude.broadband is intermittent and thats with fttp in the house~~~,Brackley~~~,2017-11-19~~~,1,1,4,1
At first I was happy with BT I felt I was getting a great deal  landline and unlimited Internet fibre optic for £46 a month.  After a year when my contract ran out they offered me a contract phone for £17 a month with 6gb a month  I took the offer and was also offered for £5 extra I would get unlimited data  I refused it at first thinking I didn't need it due to having my WiFi  but 6gb didn't last long and I noticed when I tried to connect to my BT router it would only connect for 10 seconds and stop and then I would have reconnect again and ive done that ever since I got the contract which was months ago. I remembered the woman offering me unlimited data for £5 a month and I rang up to enquire about the deal  the first guy had nothing on it and connected me to someone else who said to me they don't do unlimited data at all  so either he was unsure of this offer and unlimited data or I was about to get scammed even though the woman knew all about my contract with BT. So in the end I'm stuck with this phone that runs out of data in about 3-4 days which connects to the router for 10 seconds each time and it's a 2 year contract. In the end BT offered me 15gb of data for £27 a month. That's a rip off I've seen better deals on better phones for just  £3 more. So either BT fixes my issues or once my contract is over I will be paying someone else for their services which I'll also be recommending to my friends and family too.~~~,Daventry~~~,2017-11-19~~~,2,3,4,2
Broadband ordered and confirmed on 8 Nov  told the connection would start on 18 Nov. On 9 Nov told got a text to say connection will be on 22 Nov.  Then a couple of hours later got a text and email to say connection will be on 13 Dec!  Spent ages on the phone to their customer service  finally told connection definitely on 22 Nov.  Get an email a few days later saying 13 Dec.  More wasted time chasing them  and their rubbish webchat this time.  Still can't confirm the order.  Incompetent company!~~~,London~~~,2017-11-18~~~,1,1,1,1

Beware BT Cancellation charges SCAM Don't even bother signing up  even if the telecomms network restricts your choices.  Hopefully your mobile data covers you. My £26.50 a month 12m broadband quickly turned into circa £60/m for 6m with spurious additional charges (£55 free router  £30 disconn fee) once somebody else decided to take over my line after 5 months and I was charged full year.Shouldn't be legal but according to the ombudsman & BT it is  billing 2 or more people for the same line.  Once again the big boys win.  I was later sent a pdf of 155pages of Ts&Cs and guess what  early termination charges are right at the back  albeit unclear to calculate.40 years of no more BT custom from me & family members~~~,London~~~,2017-11-13~~~,1,1,1,1
Total disgusting. Phoned on several occasions to say broadband was dropping out to be told all tests were fine. Asked about home bub 6 as knew loads of people with it to be told its only for fibre optic and was asked to upgrade. I told them there was no way i was upgrading as they werent providing me with the service i was already paying for. Reluctently i agreed to an engineer visit after being told by an advisor that if he didnt toucb anything within the property I wouldnt be charged. I took the day off work and an engineer came  went  then came back and said the problem was sorted. It wasnt! A second engineer was booked but i couldnt afford to take another day off work so asked my father to go over. My father has onset dementia so after engineer called to say he was on the way  i called him back to say my dad would no remember to say but he WAS NOT to touch anything in my house till id ok'd it and to phone me first. I got a call half hour later saying he had removed my master socket and leads from back of hub and it should bd fine?? I told him not to touch anyything!. On my return home  my broadband wasnt workibg and there was a hole left in my hall wall! My complaint escalated to a higher department and the upshot was i was offered a hub 6 (strange as id been told i could only get that if i upgraded to fibre optic) and its solved the prob and i got a call saying i had credit for lack of service for months. Today though  ive had £142 taken from my bank for 2nd engineer visit (the 1 thaf desroyed my hall and fixed nowt) and when questioning it got called from some snooty woman saying this is correct!. Im still waiting for my complaint lodged with openreach re engineer who vandalised my home and now im being charged £140 for the pleasure. Customer service is shocking  they dont deserve the money i work hard for~~~,Lockerbie~~~,2017-11-12~~~,1,1,2,2
Easily the worst company I have ever dealt with. They lie and never understand your problem . My broadband dropped out daily for 5 years..countless engineers sent to no avail. Told problem was in my house and wanted to charge me for this. Left them 1 month ago and been with plusnet...no drop out since. BT slow your broadband down..fact.. I urge you all to leave and join Plusnet..let put these clowns out of business~~~,Burton on Trent~~~,2017-11-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Well 5 weeks sknce upgrade to fibre. 1 week no service 4 weeks 4 engineers and a service that is not working properly. Held direct debit until working now have cut me off and wont carry on with repair till paid.If carlsberg supplied the worst broadband they would call it bt broadband. I work in the IT industry and BT Is the worst~~~,Wirral~~~,2017-11-10~~~,1,1,1,1
Broadband didn’t work at all. Called customer service who told me it was due to my TV being to powerful?? Eventually they conceded there was an issue with line  engineer checked and said it was fine  continued to have issues so they said an engineer would visit  took a day off work but they didn’t show up  14 hours of calls later  they ‘fixed’ issue  still can’t get broadband upstairs  BT device desk said it isn’t there concern as apparently I have a strong signal. Unbelievably bad service and broadband speed. Like stepping back to the 90’s.~~~,Henley on Thames ~~~,2017-11-10~~~,1,1,2,1

Absolutely appalled. After having many issues with slow broadband as well as it completely dropping out daily  I called BT to rectify this problem on many occasions. Each time my broadband was tested and the results came back 'fine'. Once it was clear that it most certainly wasn't fine  more testing occurred over 48 hours; of which I was promised a call back. Of course this never happened  and this continued each time I called. I then had to start explaining each time I called that the customer service had been poor and stressed my lack of faith to any call back promised. Of which I was assured they were 'sympathetic' with my situation and past dealings and I most certainly would be getting a call back. Of course this still did not happen. I then turned my attention to the complaints department. After being on the phone for 1 hour and 45 minutes  being passed from pillar to post  I was again assured i would receive a call back the following day  any time time before 9pm. After anxiously awaiting my call back ALL day  they finally called gone 7pm as i was on my way out of the door to a birthday meal. After previously stressing I wanted to leave  I gave in to allow them the opportunity to rectify the broadband issues as well as the atrocious customer service. I was once again assured they would call back the next day  before 9pm  to run more tests and see if they could fix my Wi-Fi. Well what do you know  I have received nothing. I have genuinely been in tears through stress and frustration at the treatment I have received and am shocked beyond belief this has happened AGAIN. I have never edured such stress with any company of any kind  as I have with BT. So if you'd like a reliable broadband and a good customer service base to take any problems to  do not use BT.~~~,Surrey~~~,2017-11-08~~~,~~~,~~~,2,2
well where do i start?! firstly i did not even get my BT TV and internet. had to cancel after 1 week of ordering  i had placed my order over the phone with a lovely man  and unfortunately thats where all my problems started. he had told me my order went through fine  i then called on the saturday to see when it gets delivered  to my shock i found out that the TV never went through (i would never of known if i didnt go on the live chat)  this woman then rang me very rude  telling me if i want tv i have to wait for an extra week  she then said she will call back sunday at 6pm after i finish work  she then rushed me off the phone not letting me talk and HUNG UP ON ME.. well it got to sunday 730 still no call so i contacted them again. he said she had not bothered even noting the account for them to call me  he then assured me someone will call me 6pm monday. well here we are now tuesday at 630pm still not had a call so i contact again for the 3rd time. this time i got passed from person to person  none of which actually helped me they just kept saying 'i'll pass you on to so and so and they can help'. well it then took them 50 mins to actually type a message to me. and what he came back with is 'can someone just call you tomorrow about this'. the result ended in me and him arguing over the chat as he would not allow me to cancel my order he said 'ill just call you in the morning and you can speak to someone then'. i was extremely angry then after getting passed to so many different people they were getting ruder as they passed me to each person. it took me nearly 3 hours to cancel my bt. cant imagine the problems i would of had if i didnt contact them that initial day. worst customer service i have ever known  all members of staff was rude to me. would not recommend to my worst enemy. shams of a company. i would recommend people to leave the company rather than join it.!~~~,BRECON~~~,2017-11-07~~~,1,1,1,1
While my connection is fairly reliable the speed is very poor - usually between 1 an 2 mbps. this makes it impossible for me to upgrade things like my TV or anything else that relies on good broadband speed. Even 5 mbps would help!~~~,Rhodes Minnis~~~,2017-11-07~~~,3,3,1,4
"4 weeks ago I decided to leave Talktalk after 3 years of appalling service  poor internet speeds  consistent incorrect billing and downright negligence with my account management. So  thinking that BRITISH TELECOMS  being the pioneer in BRITAIN for all things TELECOM's  would be the solution I took a plan with them.  I was due to have my broadband connected by midnight 6/10th. On a weekly basis I would contact BT to ensure that everything was in place in order to have my broadband activated  but guess what - I wake up on the 7th AND NO INTERNET.  After contacting BT I was spoken to by a rather terse and interruptive operative called Kira (Reading the other reviews it seems that if you have attitude you have a guaranteed job at BT). Kira  couldn't give me a time for when the engineers ""should have"" done this work on 6/10  Kira also couldn't ""guarantee"" that I would have internet on the 7th. After asking why I was not contacted with regards to the delay I received a ""we were not aware of the issue"" - how is that the case if the engineer has already attended. So  in conclusion. I have no internet  am losing money thanks to not being able to get online  had an earful of attitude for asking for a guarantee that I would have internet by 7/10 AND am PAYING FOR THIS?!~~~",london~~~,2017-11-07~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
I'm going to start with the positive of we had a great member of the BT team who helped us in every way he possibly could and I cannot take that away from him but however his fellow employees are absolutely disgraceful extremely rude and refused to give their name for complaint. The wifi is absolutely appalling !!! I thought this was the 21st century ! Fees like the 90’s with the dial up internet ! I've never experienced a wifi as terrible as this one. Apparently he router/hub has won awards for its speed well I can tell you it's a shambles ! It struggles to load the smallest of apps! When I try to use BT sports the wifi cuts out completely and the channel won't work due to the poor excuse of wifi. Struggle to stream on the BT sports app   incredibly disappointing ! Left sky because of how shocking they were ! Seems they are al the same  !!!~~~,Greater manchester~~~,2017-11-05~~~,~~~,5,~~~,~~~

BT is a complete nightmare  ordered fibre broadband from them  they failed to connect it  they kept on changing dates for over 6 weeks   had to take my business else where and then I get a bill for £129.99  what exactly is this bill for BT as I had no broadband from you! Complete scam! I will never recommend this company  I've been on the phone with BT longer than any other company I have dealt with before  completely incompetent!~~~,London~~~,2017-11-03~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
Bt broadband is a deceitful company that misold a renewal contract that we took to the ombudsman service to completely get shut of. With a pixellated Tv service that was a shambles with countless online chat help which they didn't and engineer visits to no fix whatsoever.DO NOT entertain this company.~~~,North wesr~~~,2017-10-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT disconnected my broadband two weeks before I was supposed to move and even though they assured me they would reconnect it they didn't. Then on the day I moved I received a call from them assuring me that my broadband would be working. It didn't. Then I was told there was a fault and it would be fixed by the following Tuesday. It wasn't. Then they told me it would be working by the Friday and it wasn't. Then much to BT's confusion my landline and broadband started working two days later. An engineer came to check the line because although it was working they were being told there was a fault on the line. He fixed the fault by replacing the connection box in my house. I watched him test everything including the broadband speed. Everything was working. Then a week later my broadband stopped working again. I called BT and they told me an engineer had come out to connect my broadband. This is ridiculous!! I have complained and I have escalated this issues over and over again but nothing is resolved. To anyone who is even considering BT don't. They are not worth the time and effort or money.~~~,London~~~,2017-10-31~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Terrible!! Had a 12 month contract  great deal  price at £31.50 including sport  tv  line and broadband. Been with them x3 years. Then this year the problems started  messed up my bill  phoned customer services  said it was a computer glitch. This kept happening month after month  then last month I phoned them and was this time informed that the bill had increased and I hadnt replied to an email stating that I wanted to leave mid contract under these conditions.I searched my email  spam  history  junk mail. And no record of any email.This is a scam by bt  I've searched the internet and found many people with the same problems.. how can they be allowed to change a contract mid way through.. fortunately I'm not long away from the end. Good riddance  beware  the greed has kicked in just like Sky.~~~,Salford~~~,2017-10-30~~~,1,1,3,1
I am beyond disappointed! There is a technical fault with my internet. Spent the whole day going back and forth and got incorrect advice. Told that an engineer would come to fix the internet between 8-1. No one came. I called to see what is happening and I was told first that the appt was cancelled. Then I speak to the manager and he tells me that they didn't actually book it properly. So I spent most of my day waiting for nothing. Now they cannot fix the fault until Monday. What a joke. Will be going with a different provider for sure.~~~,High Wycombe ~~~,2017-10-27~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

It's a shame I have only just renewed my contract I have to put up with this for another year.

Ordered broadband on the 15.09.17 clearly stated £120 BT Reward Card but now they are saying there was no offer on the 15th and the offer started on 19.09.17 so for the sake of 4 days they are happy to loose a customer. Absoulte disgrace as it clearly stated the reward card which is why I went for the higher broadband package. Well done BT you've lost a customer  not before dragging out the complaint so I'm out of my cancellation period and want to charge me £600 for leaving. Yeah ok then. The broadband isn't constant and trying to watch anything on demand through their box is impossible as just stops connecting. STAY AWAY!!!~~~,milton keynes~~~,2017-10-26~~~,1,1,1,1
"Customer service is beyond awful (it wouldn't let me give zero stars). The line developed a fault which mysteriously resolved itself a day  and despite me getting text confirmation that it had been cancelled  they still sent the engineer out anyway. On cancelling my contract for TV  I had to write a letter to complain after they flatly refused to take my complaint about contract termination charges by telephone. Refused to allow me to give advance notice (more than a month) notice to terminate my contract. I was lied to and deliberately (I feel) misled as to my rights under the ""Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts"" Regulations. An eerily similar  awful experience when trying to cancel broadband a few months later. It really is hard to put in words how awful they are to deal with on any level  but woe betide you if you want to leave them someday...~~~",Skipton~~~,2017-10-25~~~,1,1,2,2
Bt infinity does that stand for infinately dropping out  poor speed and broken hubs? Had nothing but problems with infinity and for £50 a month a wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy. Over the year ive had the awful service I have had four supposedly new hubs. Been on  the phone to India for dozens of very hard to understand hours. Had service men galore and still its poop. They come  look at the new hub   test the speed and go away happy with the 36mb ish speed. That lasts for a few days then we are back into dropouts and speeds of less than 10mb sometimes even as low as 0.4mb. Nothing is ever done and the compensation ive recieved in all this time us £11. And that is even taking into account haf total no service for eighteen days. Bt is a joke. One star is too much tbh but no option for minus stars.~~~,Bucks~~~,2017-10-24~~~,1,1,1,1
BLOODY TERRIBLE (BT)  TEST YOUR LINE FOR STABILITY AND MADE UP YOUR MIND WITHIN THE CANCELLATION PERIOD (IF THEY HAVE ANY). If you have a problematic line then you will know many case handlers by name and guys from cancellation department as you will spend quite some time with them. Your first priority would be pick their calls even if you are in a meeting. You will end giving up any hopes of cancellations or line getting rectified.~~~,ig89~~~,2017-10-23~~~,1,1,1,1

ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE is a complement for the most imcopetent and unorgansied company I have ever had the unfortunate chance to deal with. Whatever will go wrong  will go wrong  and more.

Utterly amazed at how badly we've been treated by BT. We signed up for their broadband service in mid September and were told that the engineers would be round to connect our flat on the 11th of October. We thought that was a bit of a wait  but accepted it and waited. On the day  no one came. Annoyed that two of our flatmates took the day off to make sure someone was at home we phoned and found a system error meant we had been missed. We were given an emergency appointment for the 13th. Guess what? No one turned up. Furious  as again one of us took a day off to wait for the engineers  we called and BT claims the same error occurred for them again. Right...Appointment made for today (17th). One of our flatmates again takes the day off  her birthday  and BT still don't come. Three times in a row is actually not just unacceptable  but extremely rude. I can't quite believe BT and their customer response is next to useless and awfully organised. We have been offered no compensation and not even an apology. This has been a really upsetting experience and as a result I will avoid BT from now on. Horrible company.~~~,London~~~,2017-10-17~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with Bt for a long time and their service sucks big time  i am supposed to be getting 7mbps download but i only get just over 2mbps  hundreds of calls to India has solved nothing over the last 6 years  i will be changing provider very soon  do not go with Bt if you don't  want hassles like i have  Bt are the worst provider going in my opinion  stay well clear.~~~,suddon~~~,2017-10-15~~~,1,1,1,1
"Diabolical treatment of customers. Heed my warning DO NOT GET INVOLVED WITH BT.  EVER.  YOU WILL REGRET IT. we moved out of our house 2 months ago I phoned BT spoke to (Sol) to ask them to cut off the phone the day we moved out  but when I realised it could be any time before midnight on that date hand to change it to the day before 2nd phone call.  We have a period between moving out and we are not yet in our new house  BT (Kieron) advised me to put thing on hold as I would get a better deal as a current customer (FIRST LIE).  Staying with relatives got an email as usual to ""see my latest bill"" I phoned to ask what was going on   spoke to 3 different people (Evette  Juliet  and David) who agreed I should not have a bill.  And in fact THEY OWED ME £81.91 as I had been overcharged  for several months  I already knew that as my bill had gone up over several months from £42.59 to £65.98 but I couldn't face the trials of contacting BT.  45 minute phone call with David who said he would send me several emails with all the amounts I was owed which added up to £81.91 but he couldn't send immediately while I was on the phone because his ""computer was frozen""!   Ok 2 hours later surprise surprise no emails and no money back!  I'm moving and dealing with solicitors  estate agents and surveyors so didn't have time or energy to phone BT again for another week  till I spoke to Rose who agreed BT owes me £81.91 but I CANT HAVE IT BACK AS A REFUND BECAUSE THEY DONT GIVE REFUNDS!  The maximum she said she could send was£16.95 but the rest had to remain in my account ""in credit for when they start to bill me at my new house when I move in"". Couldn't argue any more so left it at that.   2 weeks later another email to see latest bill online. For £42.56FOR WHAT!? Phoned them again spoke to Aditya  John  and Rob (in Newcastle) they all told me I hadn't cancelled my account  it was still running and they were providing a service.  WHERE FOR? I DONT OWN A HOUSE!!  my number does don't exist any more! Rob was very rude and said my case is being escalated to a different department and ""someone""will phone me in a few days and nothing to do with him any more.  It's been ""passed on"".  2 days later I got a text message saying they had tried to call me but ""had not get a response"".  I had my phone in my hand at the time and it did not ring.  2 days later they did the same thing but as I answered they hung up on me.  I have written a 3 page letter to their complaints department in Durham. Please read about how BT treated me   scroll down and read how they treat 1 000's of their customers.  But before you choose anyone else read their reviews as well   THEYRE ALL THE SAME!!! I was going to switch to  Plusnet and their reviews are just as bad.  There are not many choices in rural parts of the country so you are stuck. I am still fighting them and the ombudsman will take up my case next week as it will have been 8 weeks by then with no resolution.  If you are trying to fight BT or ANY of them please contact the ombudsman they will fight your corner for you.  I can't leave no stars for customer service so have just left the lowest possible.  Broadband speed and reliability ... I haven't got a phone line or broadband OR A HOUSE TO CONNECT IT TO SO that should be no stars as well!

BT IS THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!! THEY MADE US WAIT FOR ALMOST 3 MONTHS FOR INTERNET!!!!!!THEY ARE MAKING JOKES ON THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!!! THEY JUST TAKE THE MONEY AND NOTHING ELSE!!! Me and my partner called in August at BT to install broadband in our home. The order we made was through telephone and the guy from BT said the order is done  we have to wait 3 weeks to get our hub and everything. When the day came  we didn't received anything. We called BT again only to be told there is no order in their system and we have to wait one month more. I am a student and I need internet everyday and my boyfriend is doing his work through internet so you see how frustrating that is. The people they hire for customer service are not capable to think  they are robots  they just repeat the same phrase again and again. They don't even speak english!!!!!!!! So here we are  after 2 months of waiting for BT broadband  after spending hundreds and hundreds pounds for internet cafes  phone data etc the hub finally arrived. When we finally thought we are going to have internet at home..it is not working again. We call them to see what is the problem and they tell us to wait a few more days because we don't have a phoneline in the house?????? They couldn't even check in their system this major thing???? After the engineer came and solve the problem  we called them again and again only to be told...in final stage that the hub is not working properly and we have to wait 1 more week to receive another one... THIS COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO WORK IN THIS COUNTRY!!! IS THIS LONDON????? HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO WAIT FOR 2 MONTHS AND 2 WEEKS FOR INTERNET???? TRUST ME  DON'T YOU EVER BUY ANY SERVICE FROM THIS DISGUSTING COMPANY!!!!!!!!~~~,London~~~,2017-10-11~~~,1,1,1,1
