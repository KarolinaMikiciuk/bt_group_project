Absolutely disgusted with the service I have received from BT for past year I have had a fault where the Broadband drops intermittently  called them out Engineers are not interested in getting the fault fixed just keep telling me its an internal fault  eventually they tracked the fault to being external and still having big issues they say its fixed week later same issues never interested take days to come out and by this time your business will be finished. You think I am joking please try BT~~~,Burton on Trent~~~,2020-05-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Utterly abysmal! Constant disconections  never deliver incentive gifts. Took them a whole year to even get my name right on my account! Prices rise mid-contract  engineers don't turn up  a thousand and one excuses and the poorest service I have ever come across. Moved elsewhere as soon as I could! Disgraceful customer service.~~~,~~~,2020-05-13~~~,1,1,1,1

BT Best speed on a good day will be in the region of 3meg which is pretty poor. Giggerclaer promise the earth at 30mb but are way behind schedule and reviews from their existing customers dont bode well. BT is only option using old copper cable and we are some distance away from their box. On one outage BT said we had internal fault which we had to disprove at a cost to us! Only then did they send out an Open Reach engineer.~~~,Noss Mayo~~~,2020-05-12~~~,2,3,1,3

"I'm have been using BT Broadband from September 2017 (on 18 months contract bases). Generally  speed is exceptionally good (I can't say great or outstanding) but occasionally (once in 2 or 3 weeks) connection will drop  and the router will reboot itself and connects you back again. I'm okay with that as long as it connects without any issues.  However  the main problem with BT is its customer service. One needs to wait a long period in the call to get connected to customer service. Once connected  the customer service executive will listen to your query and raise a complaint saying  somebody will call us to resolve the issue. A couple of days/weeks later someone will call us and give some penny's compensation and do nothing about the issue. A month or 2 later the same issue again and the same process again. Awful service.  Apart from the these issues  I have been cheated on the contract term even though I have evidence in writing. It all started with my home move in 2019. I asked to move the services to the new address well in advance (requested placed on 8th July 2019 to move the services to the new home on 29th July 2019). During the call  the customer service executive said that I have to do the re-contract for 18 months again (originally my contract was 18 months) at the same price as before else I have to pay £120. I was happy to re-contract at same price rather than paying £120. I received a mail with the new contract terms wich saying like this ""Package - Broadband and CallsBecause you're moving home  your line rental contract will be renewed for 12 months  starting when your phone service starts at your new address. Unless we've agreed otherwise  any other contracts you have will continue until their original end dates."" I called customer service again and reconfirmed about the contract length (18 months). However  on the day of the move (29th July 2019) received a text message stating that there are some technical issues  the services move will be delayed. On 5th Aug 2019  I was back on broadband. Fast forward to April 2020  BT started charging me more than my contract price from March 2020 bill. I called customer service and got to know my contract is expired. I was on call for 1.5 hours trying to explain my contract was not expired stating to the mail I received during the home move. If I was re-contracted for 12 months or 18 months  I will still be in the contract considering my services at the new home started on 5th Aug 2019 (it's been 9 months from the move). No matter however I try to explain to him  he is in no mood to listen to my explanation. He said BT will consider the time I spent at the old address into 18 months contract. I was referring to the mail I received during the move but he replied they can't listen to the calls recorded during the move (considering very old). He insisted to do re-contract to avoid extra charges. I declined and ended the contract. I felt like I have been cheated.~~~",Farnborough~~~,2020-05-06~~~,1,1,2,2
Useless customer service  useless technicians who blame you and your devices for the slow connection. When they have fault they tell 2 different stories to 2 people in the same household. How nice ?~~~,London~~~,2020-05-06~~~,1,1,2,1
We called BT help line like 10 times now and they all seem to be useless! The worst service ever rude and very unhelpful!! The internet is keep loosing signal all the time and all they say is that on they side it shows that is working just fine! ********!!! We paying so much money each month and they won't even try to solve the problem and if we want to finish the contract earlier we have to pay extra money!!! How does it work??? Really?!?! If you cant provide my house with a internet which doesn't keep disconecting how can you keep taking money from us!!! They won't even send anyone to check it or try to fix it... still same excuse  they say that it's working fine! That's just disgusting customer service and ripping people off!!! I wont recommend it to anyone!! There is so many different internat options on the market!! BT is a massive scam with the worse customer service ever!!!! I hope people relise soon how **** you are and this company goes down and whoever the rude woman was on the phone I hope you loose your job and end up on the streets as that is what you deserve for taking people money without providing the service you promised!!!

Utterly appalling service. Took at 18mths contract with BT  the rep on the phone convinced me to take BT TV though not that bothered about. Didnt mentioned that taking this extends broadband contract to 24mths and because I didnt read the small print as assumed it was 18mths as discussed am not signed in for 6mths longer than I thought and broadband offer only ran for 18mths so now paying more. This is an elaborate con and was miss-sold. Never to with BT again~~~,lancing~~~,2020-04-25~~~,1,1,4,4
I have used BT for the last few years and the internet would cut out once or twice a day despite having their fastest package and living in central london. I tolerated this.I have now not had working internet for 4 weeks; 2 weeks completely dead and the last 2 weeks works 50% of the time at 2.3mbs This has been incredibly frustrating and BT have no way to improve this. I have subsequently released myself from the contract. Good bye  for ever!~~~,London ~~~,2020-04-12~~~,1,3,1,1
wat a load of poo but super broadband is .. i wouldn't recommend it to no one at all.. its sooo slow .. i spoke to 3 people from Customer services .. 2 were okay and one was jus very rude .. the broadband is NOT RELIABLE AT ALL and speed test is a load of bull too .. Trust me and stay well away from bt .. absolutely waste of time~~~,bradford~~~,2020-04-11~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT for a number of years  since I moved out  and have always had broadband with BT. We are now moving house so we had to cancel for the short term as we are moving back to my parents. Because of the covid-19 outbreak everything has been put on hold. Having only beenndisconnecred for 1 week I called BT to ask if we could temporarily re connect  taking into account the current situation. They said there was no way they could do that and all I could do was sign up for a 24 month contract. I would have thought they could help out loyal customers but obviously not. I wont ever be using BT again.~~~,Derbyshire~~~,2020-04-11~~~,1,1,4,4

Robbing  scum bag thieves  would be a polite way of describing BT  my parents have been BT customers for over 40 years  I recently discovered they have been paying £52 per month for broadband and weekend calls. Here is the laugh  THEY DONT USE THE INTERNET  they were miss-sold this package without knowing the valve of what this type of package should cost  when I complained as their son  not only did i have to deal with the most condescending  patronising and rude customer services  but their response was that these accounts are self administered  how can you self administer when you do not use the internet?? if i had not have found out how much they were paying  then BT would still have been quietly taking their money  against their agreement with Ofcom!! I have asked them to refund these payments  they refused and offered £40 as good will gesture with an ultimatum  absolute scum in my opinion  avoid BT at all costs  the same package that BT had been supplying is available elsewhere for lest than £20~~~,Inverness~~~,2020-04-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Owing to the extreme circumstances we are experiencing at the moment  my daughter needed to work from home. I did spend a long time on the phone  but met some lovely people whilst doing so; all extremely pleasant and helpful. I had a poor signal in the room my daughter needed to work in and BT were able to help me sort this out.  If you need to ring BT  please be aware that the people on the other end of the line are doing their best in extremely difficult times. Be patient and be kind!~~~,Benfleet~~~,2020-04-04~~~,5,5,5,5
Absolutely terrible experience  probably the worst company in the history of telecommunications. Very pricey for low quality broadband unless you have a contract with them in which case you can not escaoe from them. I tried cancelling the service after my contract ended and had a horrible experience. The broadband was less than 10 Mbps. I was not able to cancel the service successfully and they continued adding extra fees to my bill for late payment even though I made it clear I will be cancelling my account. On top of that I had to wait for over 30 minutes in line before I gave up but at the same time I was being charged for a phone call. If I could give 0 stars I would have. I have honestly never experienced any customer service as deceiving  money-grabbing and horrible in my life. Please do your research before choosing a broadband supplier. I would hated to see valnurable people getting exploited by BT.~~~,Manchester~~~,2020-03-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely disgusting customer service. My father died last Wednesday after being in hospital for 7 weeks prior to his death.Tried to contact BT on Friday to cancel the contract but unable to get through. Today  I managed to fet through  however cancellation will only take affect from today...not when he died.Just a money grabbing  inferior broadband company.~~~,STAFFORD~~~,2020-03-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Terrible broadband slow issues with internet at times sometimes wifi is slower than other days wifi router restarts on its own and take long to reset itself you pay for a service and don't receive the speed you of for still slow nd not a difference when buying a different pack~~~,Streathm~~~,2020-03-21~~~,1,1,1,1
TERRIBLE service. Penalised for being loyal- still paying £45/month when they are offering the same service far cheaper (£20/month). Do they not have a duty of care to inform you of better packages? PLUS I was getting 2-3mB not the 30mb minimum... compensation of £20 IF I signed up to a new contract! Absolutely appalling.~~~,winchester~~~,2020-03-18~~~,1,1,1,1
Had BT for 2 months now  had several issues  slow speed was the first. Guaranteed minimum speed of 32Mbps  any time i run a test with nothing else connected but my laptop  i'm lucky to get anything above 22Mbps. Phoned BT  customer support was good and attentive  they identified a fault  the BT engineer came out  and was receiving above 30Mbps. Four weeks later  it keeps dropping out  reported again  there is another fault with the line  speed is slow again. Waiting on it to be 'fixed'. Not holding my breath that it will stay fixed.Also you should note  that with my previous broadband provider  the router where it was placed offered a solid wi-fi signal throughout the house. With the BT router  in the same location  the wi-fi signal is very patchy. This can only be on purpose to encourage you to spend additional on their wi-fi extender at £100 each.I will be considering my options over the course of the next couple of months.~~~,Kilwinning~~~,2020-03-18~~~,3,5,3,1
"If I could rate 0 stars I would.This is the first time I've EVER wrote a review about internet providers..BT is horrible from the service itself  to the support ""they offer.""*AT LEAST* twice a night  my router will turn off/disconnect broadband randomly during movies  games  etc.There are no reports of outage or weather problems. Just an awesome added benefit you purchase along with your package.Aside from when the actual service deciding to work on it's own will  you will not get what you pay for. Speeds are fairly reduced from the actual amount (and package you believed to have had) to pay. To sum up this review  save your time. Save your money. Save your countless frustrations. Find a different more reliable service before you're stuck like me!~~~",Thetford~~~,2020-03-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Bt is a joke  not funny.Very bad internet company.. they take more than two weeks to send an engineer to install the broadband  then he doesn’t show up and they give you another two weeks to wait.. Awful customers service  they don’t know how to deal with problems and people. I wouldn’t suggest it to anyone. I’m using it only because if I don’t I have to pay a year contract anyway  but it’s taking almost half a year to get my broadband working so... choose something else  anything.~~~,London~~~,2020-03-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Paying for fast speed get just 12.5mb its appalling and you cannot speak to a person to get resolved.~~~,Brighton~~~,2020-03-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Shocking service  kept on hold for half an hour each time to then be told there’s a fault and your internet will be turned on no later than midnight tonight. Check the internet the next morning  still no internet and repeat this process every day for a week! And guess what  still no internet and still left on hold for half an hour when you call!~~~,Surrey~~~,2020-03-12~~~,1,1,1,1

"The worst customer service i have ever experienced. They can change your plan without telling you. They renew your plan without telling you. Then they tell you your ""discount"" runs out then extends your contract past this point and then double your prices. The manager that we spoke to was argumentative  withholding information and rude.Ill never use BT Again.~~~",Cheshire~~~,2020-02-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Just had my final bill come in. I have been a customer of bt for the last five years and never missed an expensive monthly payment. My final bill is a criminal £307 that is literally just my cancellation fee! Won't ever be using BT again~~~,Grange over sands~~~,2020-02-24~~~,1,1,1,1
The most horrific broadband service I have ever known. If you’re reading this then please don’t frustrate yourself further by joining BT broadband. It never works especially on weekends when it’s required the most. I have made the biggest mistake by joining them. They have also been overcharging me every month and when I complained nothing happened. I’m being charged £4-5 every month on my bill even though I’m on a fixed contract. When I rang up to enquire they told me we have increased it while I was in a contract fixed at the outset ??? Here’s the thing it NEVER works~~~,Harrow~~~,2020-02-23~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with this supplier B.T. over 10 years but now disappointed with the cost. They did warn me of contract ending but now on expensive standing one.  The speed and reliable service is good but now considering a change due to cost and will do so if not reduced to a common cost of other providers in this area. The only concern I have is the loss of service by doing so.~~~,Frome~~~,2020-02-22~~~,4,4,4,5
Absolutely horrible. Always disconnecting~~~,London~~~,2020-02-14~~~,1,2,4,1
I am pretty sure that some of the less favourable reviews are concocted by other broadband companies to put you off using BT.  Maybe I am one of tjhe ucky ones  but in all honesty I have had excellent servic e from BT. The only time I had to have an engineer in  was because of my own stupidity when making connection between the PC and router.  I have found over the last seven years that the broaDBAnd has NEVER failed  that the speed is most satisfactory and the price is admittedly high  but it's the old story- you get what you pay for.~~~,Solihull~~~,2020-02-13~~~,5,5,4,5
Very flaky broadband  difficult to report due to lack of customer service. Phone line does work sometimes! Would not recommend~~~,Lancashire~~~,2020-02-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Is there a worse company than BT? I placed an order and had confirmation of it two weeks ago. It was supposed to be activated today. Having heard nothing I rang them this morning to see what's going on. Apparently the order HASN'T been processed because Openreach think there are two lines into this property. There aren't. They don't know the number of the phantom line and didn't bother to contact me  they just did nothing. Absolutely lousy service. I'm thinking I've dodged a bullet.~~~,Norfolk~~~,2020-02-12~~~,1,1,1,1
Really stay well clear of BT completely the worst company to deal with . I have been informed that Sky are more customer friendly   BT staff do not care completely unfair have had issues since 13th December 2019~~~,Newmarket ~~~,2020-02-11~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst company ever. They were charging me £45 a month for a 10 Mbps connection. I was asked to make a 24 month contract to reduce the price to £25.99. They had no problem with me not being the account holder (my partner is). As soon as I asked to cancel the account to altogether and get a refund for the last months unreliable and expensive WiFi they said they can’t talk to me because I’m not the account holder. What a joke. There are definitely better companies out there. Do your own research~~~,Manchester~~~,2020-02-11~~~,1,1,3,1
I spoke to a guy called Lewis  From Newcastle  he helped me when I was moving my broadband. I've had some good customer service before but he's definitely up there at the top! Incredibly helpful. I know sometimes I'm a little useless and he was so patient  reassuring and explained things very well. Also amazing personality  it was like talking to an old friend. I really hope this finds him because everyone needs to be recognised! Straight out brilliant man (if you do read this Lewis  I got some savage girlfriend points! Flowers and everything! Sad right! Haha) thanks again!!~~~,Portsmouth~~~,2020-02-07~~~,5,5,5,5
Absolutely trash  crap upload speeds  crap download speeds  constantly disconnects and not to mention customer service is as about as useful as a chocolate teapot. Avoid BT like the plague not worth the money.~~~,Huddersfield~~~,2020-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
I've had issues with their broadband almost from day 1: speed  reliability  dropping out  buffering....  Speaking with customer services is soul-destroying.  They are rude  unhelpful and will not accept responsibility. Avoid avoid avoid.~~~,Vale of Glamorgan~~~,2020-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
