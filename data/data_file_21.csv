Shocking service. Customer service is only helpful for textbook problems. Still awaiting my gift card  which is what enticed me as oppose to going to another provider!  Will be cancelling the whole families packages as they end their contacts. Clearly don’t value there customers at all. Moved my partner to virgin and was sent the equipment and I set it up within 3 days of ordering! And best bit is it is half the price for twice the speed!!!~~~,Nottingham~~~,2018-04-10~~~,1,1,1,1
I do not understand  how people can give such negative opinions about BT. After a several years horror with TalkTalk  switched to BT  and what? Everything works fine and smooth. Expected arround 26-30 Mbs down  got 51 constant speed as promised for BT Infinity 52! It is now 20 days from switch date. So  I adviced my son in law to switch as well! He did it and what??? ...happy  speed as promised 51 on every test.  Before switch I've got 10 to 16 from promised 76 Mbs. Disconnections twice a day  nightmare!!!TalkTalk always said and had an excuse  that this must have been a line problem  or router fault. Liars!!! This was a total waste of money and time with previous broadband provider  just excuses and apologies  never got a concrete advise! Call centre - rubbish  you are talking with Delhi. Chat rubbish  always problem to connect! At BT  you can do most things via www. They inform you via email  about every single issue. I do not gloryfy BT  but it is much better option  than TalkTalk and to be honest  other broadband providers  as I had to do with some of them earlier.~~~,Prestonpans~~~,2018-04-10~~~,5,5,5,5
Without a doubt the worst service I've ever had. Constant drop outs  and speed below 1mb/s. I've been complaining for over a year about the connection quality and still nothing has been done. Call center staff give you a different excuse depending on the day  engineers have not turned up to 5 appointments. I wouldn't use BT services if they were free.~~~,Swansea~~~,2018-04-10~~~,1,1,1,1
WHAT AN APPALLING COMPANY!!  Their service is atrocious.  When they started BT Sport they promised it would be free for customers so we signed up only for them to start charging us. when you call up to chat to them you get a rude someone who talks down to you and refuses to even listen to you just reading from a script. The broadband cut out ALL the time Third party engineers they sent out to fix problems would tell us how Mickey Mouse the wiring is and how we get any broadband service is a miracle  AND yet they feel they have the right to shout at us - the customer  surely the ones that keep them in business???  Please can we do something about these awful companies that take all our money for the worst service ever!!! I will not use BT which means I cannot have BT sport. Thank god Channel 5 have stepped to cover the MotoGP~~~,Cotswolds~~~,2018-04-08~~~,1,1,2,1
5 Routers Later Connection Still Drops  After contacting BT 6 times and 5 Hub5's later enough is enough. The router resets itself many times a day and all BT do is send another router. Clearly it's not the router and after some investigation it appears the BT network is overloaded. According to a professional BT wire everybody onto the same ring and that can not handle the bandwidth of everybody at peak times.  I contacted them a few weeks ago and they said they would monitor the connection. 8 router resets later over 4 days they claimed it had not dropped in the 4 days they was monitoring. Clearly they can't admit to the real issue.  They also told us that in their T&C's it states that the connection can drop up to 5 times a day so tough luck. I signed up for 2 year contract a year ago and I'm regretting it massively. Any gamers or people that need a solid connection for personal use I cant warn you enough. DON'T GET BT.~~~,Dartford~~~,2018-04-08~~~,1,1,3,1
Rang bt to request name change was informed or cas kr be changed due to having a credit check in that name. I can change my name with passport office mortgage and bank among many other credit accounts I hold. BT need to be more sympathetic and understanding and respect and individuals wish.

Bt broadband from BT does not do what it says it will i was offered up to 32mg speed and yet i have never got over 25mgalmost every weekend i get up to 8mg yet i still pay the price for up to 32mg i then get emails asking me to take the higher broadband higher price and supposedly higher speeds yet BT's own engineers state i could never get over 32mg with the line i have now but still they push me into getting the higher broadband just so i have to pay more for the same as i get now something should be done about Bt and there practises~~~,bude cornwall~~~,2018-04-04~~~,3,1,3,1
It was reported that BT loses broadband customers over other providers (the Financial Times) and here is why!  I am a psychologist and normally I use large quantity of data to conduct analyses and draw conclusions very cautiously. In this case however  I have a definite answer to the question “why BT loses customer” because I am one (or rather I was one until a moment ago).  Reason #1 Speed does NOT matter  We signed up to a plan that was “up to 76 mbps” but we suffer from slow connection and constant internet drop-offs. It turned out that we received on average a 30 mbps broadband according to the engineer BT sent to our house  in the course of checking the problem. We thought it was not what we signed up to but BT insisted that they had provided “satisfactory” service.  We were told that a contract of “up to 76 mbps” means a service of 1-76 mbps and the guaranteed speed was determined by a rather mysterious equation that the BT server decided upon running a couple of weeks after the customer registered. Many factors could influence the guaranteed speed such as the service to a nearby household. Therefore  each line could be different and in our case the number was “17”. Therefore  we received a service of 30 which was faster than what we should receive. So BT could not admit they did not deliver a service they had promised despite we had been paying for a plan of 76mbps; excuse me  UP TO 76.  Reason #2 WiFi is NOT their problem (but mine  the customer’s) We were unable to watch a movie by streaming neither from Apple TV nor Fire TV because it would be constantly loading. When I mentioned this as an evidence of poor broadband service I was told that BT only guaranteed a wired connection and WiFi signals depended on too many factors that they could give no answer to a WiFi problem. As we already received “faster” speed than we should (not what we paid for though) the WiFi connectivity issue had nothing to do with their business. One of the technical support advisers was kind enough to suggest me to use a portable radio detector to look for the potential object that could significantly interfere with our WiFi signal in our house  but again  that was not what BT should be concerned about.  As a matter of fact  BT provided a signal extender to plug in beside the TV and for the TV box. Actually we constantly lost signal of TV channels too (the channels through the box not the antenna)  which indicated they were not so innocent an non-involvement of the WiFi problem. After all they knew a signal extender was necessary although it did not work.  Reason #3 Tick the box and kick the ball  As described above  the conflict between BT and us (the customer) was quite difficult to solve (even for a psychologist who studies problem solving). On the one hand BT thought they provided a satisfactory service (above 17); on the other hand we felt let down and not given what we paid for. There was a huge discrepancy between 30 and 76 after all.  When we started expressing our dissatisfaction and suggested we would leave BT as a result of this dissatisfaction  we were forced to speak to different persons from different teams  including customer service  technical support  and different levels of managers  at least 10 of them. All of them suggested something but could not improve our satisfaction which was a matter of fact. Why? See reason 1 and reason 2! Because speed does not matter to them and WiFi is not their problem.  In this dilemma  BT did employ the best strategy which was to tick the box and kick the ball. Each of the personnel said what they could (not doing anything please keep in mind they merely talked over the phone except for sending a person who confirmed that we did receive a speed of 30mbps) and then passed us to another person. I felt like I was talking to many tape recorders as they repeated the same things  such as “you have received a faster speed than you should”  so many times.  The end (or NEVER END) We paid a penalty to leave BT. We are celebrating because if there has to be a cost of breaking free  we were happy to pay for it. What matters here was to stop losing and suffering any longer.  Hooray BT should celebrate too: a customer PAID to leave  which in itself says a lot. My list of reasons were only based on one case but I can guarantee its veracity; the only shortcoming of this analysis is that the list of reasons to leave must be incomplete.~~~,leicester~~~,2018-04-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Signing up to the contract in the first place was easy  at the time only ADSL was abailable  at 20 MBps. I knew I couldn't get better than this at the time  but BT still tried to push a speedier and more expensive package on me. This package worked fine  but once the contract expired  and  I suspect as fibre became available  I recorded speeds of as low as 2 MBps. As we were out of contract  I'm now paying £47 per month for this. Tried to upgrade to fibre through BT  only to find that fibre is available for £29 per month to new customers but £53 per month to me!!!!At the time of the contract  they of course sent me a home hub  I hate these  they portion off a chunk of your signal to broadcast as a BT Openzone  and aren't very good. I have my own wifi box and broadcast easily across the house. If I test my broadband speed on BT  they don't tell you what the speed is  just that its 'OK'. Funny that  when I know it is a very low speed.Then if you follow the prompts  they reccomend moving your box to the middle of the house. Guess what BT  it IS in the middle of the house.So I have switched to Vodaphone fibre  for considerably less money. Not switched on yet  but feels as though BT have been robbing me blind to be honest!!!!~~~,Cheshire~~~,2018-04-02~~~,2,4,1,2

I'm looking at all these reviews and can't believe it...you would think no one is happy with BT!...well I am! I know they are not the cheapest  and you can always see a cheaper deal somewhere  but sometimes the devil you know is the best options. Other than a lower speed [30mg]than expected  I am more than happy with my broadband/phone service. If the day ever comes when I am not  I will look around but not use the reviews on this site for reference as they are not a reflection of the true situation with any provider.~~~,Keighley~~~,2018-04-02~~~,5,5,4,5
5 weeks of stress  cancelled contract by BT  reason? Still don’t know  engineer failed to turn up  numerous calls to BT  promised the world  of course it never happens.End result  £108.04 taken from my account for a service I have never had. Was told yesterday that will take up to two weeks to be reimbursed. I can’t even give a star rating. SHOCKING~~~,Bucks~~~,2018-04-01~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I would never recommend you to anybody. If I'm late with a payment you go crazy but it's ok for me to wait 5 days for an engineer.never would recommend you  infact I would go out of my way to tell anybody not to make my mistake.

Tried to order broadband & phone on 2nd March with delivery/engineers vist booked for 19th. Broadband cancelled by BT with no explanation. Re-ordered with phone & BB to be installed 23rd March. BB cancelled again. Reordered for 3rd April. Exixting phone & BB disconnected on 23rd March. BB still scheduled for 3rd April  no phone until 5th April.Totally cheesed off - no info about what  or why it's all gone wrong.

Absolutely terrible customer service. Was overcharged on a bill and was promised a refund - this wasn't processed so rang again and was told this would be reflected in following bill - it wasn't and in the end I had to chase up 3 times. Now waiting to see if refund comes through. Won't be staying when contract ends.~~~,York~~~,2018-03-25~~~,1,1,3,3
I switched my internet provider  from Sky to BT two months ago and I have nothing but problems with the reliability of the connection and the service I receive. The internet connection drops out and I get very low speeds to the point where I cannot open a web page!  In the 6 years with Sky I never had any problems with connection or any cause to call customer services.Every time I contact BT they test the line and find no fault  they say the line is not dropping and fob me off with the same old things to try  on the last call I was told BT they will only guarantee a wired connection and told me to hard wire all of my devices or to look to change my provider. When I asked to leave my contract due to the issues I was told I would be charged. I am now trapped in a contract that does not deliver the service I need consistently.  BT customer service is very poor and they do not care about their customers and are only interested in fleecing them for the money. I do not write review normally but I felt compelled to write at my disgust at the way this company treats its customers. Do not use BT for internet  if you have problems you will be on your own~~~,Leicester~~~,2018-03-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Most expensive internet provider in the country with 42.99 for brodband and line rental and stupidly expensive call charges.~~~,~~~,2018-03-24~~~,1,1,1,1
I am BT customer for a number of years. My problem with the service is:1-The service not reliable and can stop working for no reason. You spend time (hours) with BT support and the service come back and the question when will stop next time. It will not disappoint you until you see the Hub flashing.2-Calling BT is old from the book customer (NO) care. Your call is important to us kind of. We are very busy and your call is important to us. The same story every time.3-As a closed my bank account where the Direct Debit goes from the service get restricted and when I realised that (and it is my fault)  I immediately paid by card and set up direct debit. I have been told the service will be back within four hours. But guess what. seven hours and the service not back. Then typical BT the time frame changed to 24 hours.At the end I started looking around and I am moving away from BT. No need for the hassle of unreliable service where you can have a much reliable service from another provider and for less money.~~~,Romford~~~,2018-03-24~~~,1,1,3,1
Absolutely atrocious. They do not give a damn about the rubbish service they provide or the inconvenience and stress caused to the customer. Avoid at all costs and use a competitor. Three weeks after having equipment delivered we are still without tv channels or adequate WiFi. We have taken days off work at cost to us  for various engineers to come out. They haven’t fixed the problem but BT have still charged us £54.00. We have called customer services at least 15 times  again at cost to us. They refuse to compensate us for wages and time lost or refund us the £54.00 they have charged us for services they haven’t provided. This is actually fraud but again they don’t give a damn. Direct debit now cancelled and equipment going in the bin!~~~,Burstow ~~~,2018-03-24~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
They are just about making money and increasing charges. They continually increase the cost and tell you they can’t reduce it  yet they offer new customers cheap deals. They make it difficult to exit their contract and if you change anything your 18 month contract automatically renews. This industry needs regulating it is disgraceful how they operate. These are meant to be industry leaders.~~~,Rossendale ~~~,2018-03-24~~~,2,2,2,2
I have just had to cancel a new package with another provider because BT made it too uncomfortable for me to cancel my existing one which has been giving me ongoing problems. Basically the people i spoke to found it neccesary to CROSS EXAMINE me about why i am cancelling and asked questions about my new package with no regard to how this made me feel resulting in me having an ANXIETY ATTACK. For now i am stuck with BT as my broadband provider until i at least have taken advice on how to deal with this upset in a stress free way~~~,Wootton Bassett~~~,2018-03-23~~~,1,1,1,1

BT provides the worst service I ever received in this world. They left me with nearly no broadband for 3 month sending me engineers that decided that there was an internal fault in my wiring. Everybody knows that they are responsible to deliver a signal to the first junction box in the house and everybody knows that with all other wiring disconnected it should work. Not with BT after numerous calls  chats  letters  they only found that they want to charge me for their engineers visits. I closed direct debit for them after three months with no internet but horrifying bills. I went to another provider and from the next day onwards I had a superb signal and no worries except BT chasing me now to pay their unjustified bills.I don’t trust them nor their works they just try to justified their engineers visits with lies for stupid people that don’t understand electrical problems. Their disadvantage is that I used to be an electrician and do understand all their lies.~~~,London ~~~,2018-03-21~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
If I could give this company 0 stars I would. The treatment of my family has been absolutely diabolical. They have admitted time and time again that they missold policies to my elderly parents and yet months on  despite my efforts nothing has been resolved. My family live in a remote area and without landline communications  they are completely without any form of phone or internet. This is very distressing for elderly people as well as constant harassment from different departments of BT demanding bill payment  despite the complete admittance of fault from BT. As a medical professional  if this was a small company  this would be considered a safeguarding issue  exploiting elderly people. I am absolutely appalled. If only my family lived in an area where they could get Virgin service. If you can be with an alternative company to provide your communications then I urge you to do so. This is a large corporation taking advantage of the public. I would like to know how many other people have been missold tariffs and are in a similar situation.~~~,Peeblesshire ~~~,2018-03-21~~~,1,1,1,1
Was with Virgin left for BT  BIG mistake  wrong TV box sent  got that sorted  then the major problems started  tv and broadband constantly dropping when phone rings  all efforts to fix blamed on my side so I will need to pay for an engineer.

"DO NOT USE BT!!! - If you even consider using their service  DON'T!!!! Please - if you are looking at broadband and are reading this  take it from my first hand personal experience that these criminals want your money and nothing more!! I had signed a contract with BT and it took them 3 months.... 3 MONTHS to actually get the internet to work  this involved calls nearly everyday of which the representative on each occasion had no idea that I had called the day before and made me go through the same steps every time to check my broadband was working then said ""call tomorrow and see if it repairs the issue"". They made me do this for weeks! Then said they had sent out hardware which they hadn't as each time I called  the representative then told me that nothing had been sent and they themselves would send out the hardware... that took 3 attempts. Had I have wasted as much of their time as they had of mine I am sure they would charge me for that too!! THEN - when I complained they offered me a £10 compensation... £10.... 10 measly pounds after which by this point the contract had cost me nearly £150... for no internet!! That is like robbing a guy and not going to court for it!! Then when I ask to leave they want me to pay the full contract. which is 2 years long! Needless to say  they can't get their act together  they are absolute CRIMINALS!!!!  I sincerely hope that NOBODY even thinks of using this service  it is slow  expensive and the hardware they provide you with would be better off being used as a frisbee.

Never in my life have I experienced such poor service from any business I have dealt with. But I now understand why BT is worth billions because they charge you extraordinary rates and offer you a sub-par service (and I haven't been connected to anything yet). First of all I ordered my package on the 17th February  now its 18th March and I still haven't been connected to the internet.At the 27th February a engineer named John came round   he gave me the wrong advice  did nothing and left (his advice wasted a week of my time chasing loose ends regarding the internal wiring within my home  which is work I realised now he should of done). On the 5th March an engineer named Len also came to my home and did absolutely nothing and left. On the 9th March an engineer supposedly was at my property but she/he didn't even bother calling or knocking   she/he just took a picture of my house and left. On the 16th March   finally an engineer did his job properly and wired my home internally. Now all that is left is the external work  an engineer on the 16th March was supposedly meant to come but the person didn't.  Now please keep in mind between all these dates I am calling BT every single day and wasting my time trying to get an update on how to resolve my issue. There advisers are just as bad if not worse than there engineers  I've been given mixed message and flat out lied to. For example on 16th March 10-11 am I was promised internet by the end of the day by an adviser named Ohm and this is a straight lie to get me to hang up. PLEASE AVOID BT AT ALL COSTS   the only reason I haven't cancelled because me and my family are desperate due to us moving into this property recently. DO NOT CHOOSE BT   STAY AWAY FROM THEM. BT is the first company to make me lose faith in people.~~~,North-West London~~~,2018-03-18~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Shocking service  previously with sky who I left because of cost  BT infinity is supposed to be great but the internet suffers in drops constantly  the fault was reported and an engineer booked who failed to arrive  I called BT to ask where the engineer was and was told that it had been cancelled due to having been looked at by another team from BT who found no fault funny that as when I was on the phone to BT the internet failed again!  no email  text or call to tell me that it had been cancelled  so please save yourself stress and time and go elsewhere  BT has now been cancelled after only 2 months without any penalties due to them admitting that they are useless.~~~,Trowbridge ~~~,2018-03-17~~~,1,1,1,1
"Disgraceful service. Order placed in early dec and no connection in mid March . I have formally complained and been put into ""intensive Care"". This involves an off shore person calling me with incoherent updates every week using technical jargon that they are reading off of a screen  and nothing now happens automatically and requires human intervention which doesn't happen. So  step 2 gets completed and step 3 doesn't get initiated until I get on the phone and chase. I have wasted 8 days off of work  and am drained.
