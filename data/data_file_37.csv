WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I am their present customer and they are the worst. Just moved house and was told that internet connection will be there from 10th Feb 2017 at new address. Around 9th Feb internet connection was disconnected around midnight from old address so that a new connection can be put up on 10th Feb at new address. Whole day of 10th Feb 2017 there was no connection. Nothing on 11th either and when on 12th Feb I contcated BT then I was told that there was a technical glitch. When I asked that if there was any glitch then why wasn't I informed....BT representative had no answer to it. I asked them to get me the internet connection by Monday ie 13th Feb 2017 anyhow and I was told that it's not possible because there is another company called Open Reach who are going to do it and we dont know when. Today is 16th Feb 2017 at 2:00 pm and still there is no sign of my internet connection although I am talking everyday to their customer representatives. Best part is that they assure you that you will get it but they don't know when. Me and my husband work from home and it has been a big blow to us monetarily and has been very very stressful. AVOID BT PLEASE.~~~,Birmingham~~~,2017-02-16~~~,~~~,~~~,3,~~~
By far one of the worst companies I have ever dealt with! DO NOT USE!!I took out a contract with them for my broadband and TV. All was good  and then I needed to leave my property  and move back to my parents house. I was  of course  not able to take my service with me. All of the equipment was paid upfront by me as well. I called BT to let them know and to cancel my contract  to which I was told that I needed to pay the rest for the contract?! This was a further 9 months! My argument was that I was receiving no service from them as I was no longer going to be at the property  and i was not able to take with me. They said that when I took the contract out I should have known  to which my comment was I cannot see the future. Apparently BT expect all of their customers to be clairvoyant! I shall not ever use again!~~~,Brierley Hill~~~,2017-02-15~~~,1,1,2,2
The service is fantastic when it works  I can easily run multiple devices for long periods of time.Unfortunately the broadband does like to drop out for the occasional 5-10 minute slot  this tends to happen once or twice a day. From speaking with others this is apparently a common feature.In the even you have an issue you will find the customer service to be awful (by far the worst I have ever dealt with in any industry).I have dealt with them on numerous occasions and you can always expect a minimum hold time of 40 minutes. Every time I have had an issue it has taken the best part of 3 calls to resolve over a period of days  completely unacceptable in this day and age. (my last loss of service lasted 15 days  with BT only refunding me for 5 days loss of service - line rental  a pathetic attempt at compensation).Usually phone calls are dealt with by cutting you off  creating a fictional resolution that can only be implemented after you close the phone call (had this numerous times only to find nothing gets fixed). My advice would be not to let them put the phone down on you  as they will not return calls and you will have to wait in a queue system to get back in. I hope this helps. Generally the quality of the product is great  but you will have to put up with the occasional short drop in service. You would also have to be willing to put up with the worst and most arrogant customer service assistants possible.~~~,Coventry~~~,2017-02-15~~~,1,1,5,1
This is the first time I've done one of these to complain. But BT's ability to deliver what they've confirmed is almost zero. Their lack of customer care when things have gone very wrong [ which I had to convince them I didnt actually have a aerial on my roof ] is even lower and their sense of urgency is going in reverse as they've run from my problem not to it. I am amazed they are so bad and ashamed they call themselves British  Libby Barr your team are a disgrace.~~~,SW20 London~~~,2017-02-15~~~,1,1,1,1
BY FAR the WORST company I have ever had to deal with.  Lying underhand arrogant company with staff who dont give a hoot about the customer.  A CEO who clearly needs to wake up to the reality of his company as if they could be make hundreds of thousands more in customer retentions by actually training his staff in a more positive manner.  I will be off with another company ANY company when I get out of this unfair contract.  BEWARE they start your cooling off period when you order  NOT when you get the equipment or start the contract. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.~~~,DURHAM~~~,2017-02-14~~~,1,1,1,1
Dreadful  unreliable and expensive.Long distance call centres offer poor customer service.When out of contract they started charging me for all sorts of stuff.~~~,Macclesfield ~~~,2017-02-13~~~,1,1,3,1
Quoted 30 to 40 down load speed  best actual only 18 sometimes as low as 14 basic answere when contacted tough luck. My thoughts is I am being ripped off last time I signed up they sold me Infinity 2 and Tv and do NOT provided in the area the Tv froze as the speed could not provide a constant picture~~~,Leicestershire~~~,2017-02-12~~~,2,1,1,1
Overall BT has not been too bad however it's the line rental prices that really get my goat!!! at 8.68mbps Download speed quoted UP to 17mb.~~~,Netley Abbey~~~,2017-02-11~~~,4,4,3,4
BT are liers about their prices and their speeds.  I am on their 'normal' unlimited broadband deal  and last months BT bill was 59 pounds  that's without using the phone  so just line rental and broadband cost  much higher than anything they advertise.  Add to that the fact that the phone wont make international calls even though I am being charged for one of their reduced price internatinonal calls deals  the calls just don't get through.  Its so bad we do not use the phone and wish we could just get our broadband without it.  As so many have pointed out their customer service is worse than rubbish  they just don't get anything done or even try to.  Avoid them.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2017-02-10~~~,1,1,3,1
Replied to and e/mail an upgrade  as it seemed to be offering a speed upgrade.So I payed for a different router.When checking my new router there was no difference .I complained  to find out it wasn't the upgrade I expected? The upgrade the e/mail was offering  no mention of extras  bt was offering was mentioned in original e/mail ??~~~,Maldon ~~~,2017-02-09~~~,2,1,3,4
The worst company that I've dealt with. I've tried to create a contract with them  and because three of there call centre lied over the about my order  the order was not process  even if they said that it did. I spent 5 hours over the phone with them and rising complains  and as a solution they offer me to install just phone line and after that to order broadband with speed between 1-3 Mb/s  in 2017  in Isle of Dogs. They are an embarrassment for UK.~~~,Isle of Dogs~~~,2017-02-09~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
DO NOT SIGN UP FOR BT BROADBAND. Even rating the wifi and bt services is more than generous. We get the premium wifi package  we specifically pay more to get a better wifi. Complete rubbish! It's unbelievably slow  everything buffers all the time. The wifi also cuts out at least 4 or 5 times a day. It was off today and yesterday for 30mins even after turning it on and off. Staff are so rude and unhelpful. Would highly discourage anyone from purchasing bt broadband~~~,Derry ~~~,2017-02-08~~~,1,1,1,1
Speed and reliability poor. Get asked if we wanna renew. Agree after being told we'd get upgraded hub. Details discussed. Weeks later they send same old hub anyway. I ring and spend over 1 hour to customer services  3 different advisers/departments later. All of this repeating the same stuff - sometimes being contradicted and having to argue/go in circles. Final lady sorts it out quickly  agreeing to send the hub we were promised. We shall see if it is right this time!  I asked about compensation for it taking an hour of my time after their mistake - not possible. Pretty rubbish service considering their mistake has cost me time and stress.~~~,Bath~~~,2017-02-08~~~,2,1,2,2
"We were forced to use BT since Virgin did not have any fibre close enough. At last they have recently dug up the roads and installed fibre so we can rid ourselves of the worst broadband supplier I've ever experienced  hands down.  Promised 27mbps and every night I get 1 to 5 only. Also very bad customer service who are untrained and know little more than to suggest ""you reboot the router"" they were rude enough to challenge my speed tests. I am a network engineer more qualified than any of their lost staff in the call centre who have no idea beyond the 'cheat sheet' they are using. My 5 yo could do a better job.  BT. I'm so happy to be rid of you at last!! Thanks Virgin.~~~",Basingstoke ~~~,2017-02-07~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst customer service I have experienced. Our internet has now suddenly just stopped working twice in the last two months and it takes them over a week to get an engineer to you. Such a massive waste of time for a poor service~~~,London~~~,2017-02-07~~~,3,1,3,2
Shocking customer service! having major problems with my phone line and internet and youview box paying for a device that is not working reported fault numerous times had an engineer sent out  who told me the previous engineer had not fixed the fault properly when he left the fault seemed to be resolved but now 3 days later back to square one again tonne told by a very cheeky customer service advisor from the call centre in India I may have to pay Â£130! I refused to accept this as clearly it's a fault with BT and there engineers have not fixed the fault in the first place so am now currently waiting on a manager to call me back just getting sick and tired paying for a service I'm not being provided with!~~~,Dundee~~~,2017-02-07~~~,1,1,1,1
DO NOT SIGN with BT. Worst provider ever. They even charge you extra  whitout explaining why.~~~,London ~~~,2017-02-07~~~,1,1,1,1
HiJoined bt back in September 2016 and although the broadband is good  the customer service is shocking. I have spent at least 5 hours on the phone to them trying to sort out issues with billing  I was lead to believe that my broadband was fixed for twelve months Â£10.00 + line rental  but no I got an email tonight telling me it's going up by Â£2.50 per month from the 2nd of April 2017 so explain that one bt how does that work!! Tried to ring them tonight got though after the normal twenty to thirty minutes waiting on hold  only for them to hang up on me...seriously think very carefully before joining bt they are a nightmare to deal with.~~~,Leyland Lancashire ~~~,2017-02-06~~~,1,1,3,3
AVOID AVOID AVOID  if you value your sanity.Massively unhappy with the service promissed one thing that i can online game without issue....im on the top infinity package and still can not even get a full game.....its a joke!~~~,Stockport~~~,2017-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Absolutely awful service terrible broadband and when you ring customer service spoken to like a piece of of dirt not 1 bit happy and definitely would not recommend had no internet. For 3 weeks and they send me a bill for Â£400 after refusing to pay for a service that I can't use~~~,Bootle ~~~,2017-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
Poor customer services.Poor internet servicesExtreamly expensive for a very pooor service.Keep away~~~,Cuffley~~~,2017-02-05~~~,1,1,1,1
Have had problems for three months nearly since we moved in. Have had people out but still problems. The internet keeps cutting out and we can't watch channels on BT Box. BT recognise problems on line but haven't fixed these problems as of yet and want to charge us over Â£300 to cancel service we don't get!! Look elsewhere!!~~~,Norwich~~~,2017-02-04~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst customer service team ever. You go round in circles repeating yourself to different staff members only to be transferred to someone else who does not know how to fix your issue. I have been promised call backs I have not received I have been on the phone for hours and I have had poor internet for over 3 days. I would not recommend this service to anyone. I would rate this company 0 if I could~~~,BIRMINGHAM~~~,2017-02-03~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Recently moved to BT from Sky to gain the use of BT Sport.Promised the world and as yet received nothing but poor service  unreliable broadband  incorrect broadband speeds  appalling customer service (had the phone put time on me numerous times)  had the Â£150 voucher dropped to Â£100 (now sorted)  had a threat of a Â£120 engineers bill before I even got connected  the list goes on  I for one will be going back to SKY asap.~~~,Grimsby~~~,2017-02-03~~~,1,1,1,1
BT have not resolved the issue since August 2016 until now - February 2017. I have all the evidence from August 2016 from phone call recordings & 9 reference numbers regarding this issue since then. As a BT business customer I myself have raised this issue 4 times now & nothing has been done. It has cost my business loss of earnings as i am still unable to put in a new order with BT until they have resolved this matter. I have 0 faith in this being resolved now and have contacted Watchdog & ombudsman. Be warned by this  as BT's collassal mistake leaves you in a diabolical mess. Not worth it. Watch out for this on watchdog viewers!~~~,London Canary wharf~~~,2017-02-03~~~,1,1,1,1
Rubbish broadband  router constantly drops out and very expensive compared to other providers. If you have any sense  avoid like the plague! Go elsewhere.~~~,Hertfordshire~~~,2017-02-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst customer service ever.Great if you have no issues. But you soon lose the will to livensure iffy you have. They repeatedly don't listen to wha you havery to say then when they eventuaLlysfaen do yheyou pan you on to someone else. You can go around in circlesome for days. The customer services or complaints department don't seem to exist if they do theybcanot help you.

I would like to say this....DO NOT SIGN UP WITH BT  they are nothing but liars always giving conflicting information.  Having signed up for a phone a broadband I still do not have access to this after a month of calls and messages.  They do not know what they are doing and clearly need to brush up on customer service skills.   I would suggest you stay as far away from this company as possible!~~~,London~~~,2017-01-30~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Subscribed to broadband 2 months ago and still have no service just a lot of frustrating phone calls. Do NOT get BT Broadband - simply awful service.~~~,London~~~,2017-01-29~~~,1,1,1,1
Internet speed is less than half a mb. 12 - 15 minutes to download a 45mb app. Told month ago that it was due to be improved but after speaking with neighbours. No work has been completed. Extremely unhappy.~~~,"Liverpool, Bootle~~~",2017-01-29~~~,1,2,1,1
BT have been a nightmare from day one. It took a month for them to arrange an appointment to connect our phone line  and when the day eventually came round the engineer left before finishing the job  leaving us without a working phone line or internet connection. BT have also been fraudulently billing us for calls apparently made before our line was connected! Trying to talk to anyone takes over an hour of waiting on hold  only to be told that they won't deal with your problem  or they have no idea what's been discussed before. The fibre internet connection regularly drops out at evenings and weekends  and drastically reduces in speed at busy times  making it virtually unusable. Absolutely one of the worst companies I have ever had the misfortune to deal with.~~~,Newport~~~,2017-01-28~~~,1,1,2,2
BT-what an absolute joke this company are.We have now been without broadband for 6 weeks and no reason from BT as to why this is. We have had promises made that it will be up and running again by various dates and surprise surprise the dates come and go and still no Internet. We will definitely be leaving them as their service is the poorest that we have ever received from anyone  and trying to speak to someone who actually knows what they're talking about is impossible. I would advise anyone to avoid using BT at all costs they're the most expensive and the service they provide to their customers is worthy of a ZERO star rating.~~~,Norfolk~~~,2017-01-27~~~,1,1,1,1
This is just the second time I've joined BT in my life and I now remember why I stayed away for so long! Customer service is absolutely atrocious  I've been hung up on numerous times and spoken to terribly  even when it has supposedly been a manager  and reliability is poor as it often cuts out for periods at night. The speed is alright when its working  but other than that I will be cancelling as soon as I can and never going back. Whilst I was with Sky was probably my best broadband experience.~~~,London~~~,2017-01-27~~~,1,1,3,2
If I could zero scores for satisfaction  customer service and reliability I would. BT are by far and away the worst company I've had the misfortune to deal with. The fibre optic broadband is fast when it works. I've been with them for a year now and had 2 month long (or more) sagas caused by them  and customer service is terrible. Currently going to ombudsman since I haven't had service for a month.  The have almost double the industry average for complaints  and I'm surprised it's not higher. I almost feel sorry for the customer service employees  it isn't their fault the system they inhabit is so terrible. But they are regularly rude and unhelpful  so I don't really feel sorry for them.  I will never again give them any of my time or money.~~~,West Drayton~~~,2017-01-26~~~,1,1,3,1
Superfast BT Broadband is not worthy of its own name. You will be lucky if you receive half the advertised speed you payed for and even luckier if your BT hubs connection to the internet doesn't just drop out randomly  and can stay out for several minutes. Never use BT broadband and I never will again  just Terrible.~~~,Ipswich~~~,2017-01-26~~~,1,1,3,1
So many problems  have been told will be contacted within 24 hours so many times and they never have. Their customer support is non existent. I would avoid at all costs  they couldnt get our phone connected for weeks. Then took longer to sort broadband despite calls and on-line chats. My wife and I have wasted so much time. Have reported them to OFCOM over product miss-selling. Consider other providers before BT  they are a broken company.~~~,Sheffield~~~,2017-01-26~~~,1,1,4,4
BT has been the most expensive  broadband provider  charging me a huge amount of money more than Â£50 per month for the service they agreed to provide on Â£37.00The customer service has never been helpful.I am leaving BT  as moving address and they are charging me an extra Â£32.00??? Unbelievable! I have never had a polite patient helpful customer adviser and really looking forward to leaving BT.~~~,Cardiff ~~~,2017-01-26~~~,1,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT is an absolute joke and I have to wait two weeks later from original activation date for my broadband to work as BT  cannot be bothered activating it for me. Each time I ring BT they keep telling me the same thing that there is a delay in my order also on the original activtion that the engieert never bother coming out.  Now this has put a delay in my activation. I am very appalled and thoroughly disgusted at the service I have received from BT over the past few weeks~~~,Moy~~~,2017-01-26~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Worst broadband ever  plus that expensive... if you want to test your nerves go with BT  but believe me .. even you are the strongest mind and spirit person ... after few days you will give up ... even one star is too much to review BT~~~,~~~,2017-01-25~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
BT ARE A JOKE The worst company to deal with  appalling customer service. Staff that havent got a clue.2 months to get a line and the 3 months to fail to port a number and then say you need to wait again!!! and they dont care!! speak to them and its different every time.If you are a business DO NOT go with BT  they will loose you customers  orders and Buisness. If you are with BT good luck!!~~~,Tamworth~~~,2017-01-25~~~,1,1,1,1
