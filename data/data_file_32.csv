I couldn't agree more with all the negative reviews of the BT broadband service. recently installed new customer after leaving Sky with near perfect service (other reasons for leaving). I followed the instructions for maximising wifi signal but was only getting <1mbps. Thought I should leave the router plugged in for 10 days to allow for the line to settle as advised and re-test - it was even worse  literally less than half a mbps. Called BT and was told the service is known to be unreliable and have i considered infinity - AT THE FIRST CALL. I said I used BT's 'chose the right package for me' and unlimited broadband was what was recommended. The agent could see i was getting next to nothing so put me through to the outsourced tech team who were completely useless and after 60mins simply hung up. I called back and was told the problem was solved and the case was closed - couldn't be further from the truth. This went on for a week and spent endless hours on the phone being told to do the same thing over and over again. I had no issues with Sky but was told it must be my wifi devices causing the problem and if an engineer was sent and found this to be the case i would be billed for £129. Nothing has changed since Sky so that cannot be the cause but I declined an engineer due to a complete lack of faith in BT to be honest and not screw me. To put a very long story short apparently BT don't do WiFi and there are no guarantees however with some key phrases  mention of DSR  FOI  Ombudsman and some choice posts to social media i was called back this week and released from the contract. I CANNOT STATE STRONGLY ENOUGH - PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE AVOID AT ALL COSTS. BT staff are obviously exasperated at the number of calls due to the poor broadband service and that shows in their lack of empathy or drive to put anything right.~~~,Essex~~~,2017-06-11~~~,1,1,1,1
I would give a zero star if I could. Our  internet connection has been playing up for 4 months. We've tried 3 BT routers and a third party router. We've had 10 engineer visits. Despite this we have anything between 4 to 14 hours of no internet every day! Now BT case management team have stopped replying to my calls and messages. I rang customer service and suggested that we mutually agree to terminate the contract early as the problem remains and the trust levels have gone down the drain. I was told that I need to pay a cancellation fee as the engineers are still working on it and I refuse to allow them time! They have had four and half months to sort it out. I cannot wait for the contract to end.~~~,Derbyshire ~~~,2017-06-10~~~,1,1,4,1
I had the worst experience possible with BT.After ordering the broadband online  BT scheduled the visit of an engineer at my home to connect me to the broadband (which is in Central London  so it shouldn't be a big deal) I was told the visit would take 40 minutes. It ended up taking 5 hours and a half  and the engineer didn't manage to finish in the end  leaving me without internet on that day. BT scheduled a second visit (2 weeks later) but the guy never showed up. They explained the appointment didn't go through their system and I should book another appointment (2 weeks later) 2 weeks later  EXACTLY the same story that the booking didn't go through they system  hence I should wait another 2 weeks. The third time  an engineer came for a 3 hours visit and he also didn't manage to connect me to the broadband. BT advised I schedule another visit with another engineer.  After 2 months and a half of this situation  I eventually cancelled everything to take SKY instead of BT. BT told me that because the broadband wasn't delivered  I could cancel everything free of charge.  About one month later  I got charged 91 gbp by BT ... Stay AWAY from BT !~~~,LONDON~~~,2017-06-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I switched to BT because they own the copper wire from my home to the Fibre Dist Box thinking one source if any problems arise. I have had numerous broadband failures  spoken with many BT staff in the UK and India  all of whom has said they would deal with the problem. One outage lasted 6 1/2 days. I was promised on many occasions that someone would phone me back with progress and diagnostic report. They never did.  As a retired engineer I am appalled at BTs abysmal customer support. I would not recommend them.~~~,"Ryde, Isle of Wight~~~",2017-06-09~~~,1,1,4,2
In my view BT = Prepare-To-Lose-Your-Will-To-LiveOver the years I have had two experiences with BT as a new customer - both of them were ok (apart from the waiting time for the BT engineer). Once the service was up and running I had no reason to contact them. The annoying part starts when you are moving houses – I am still in process of claiming back call charges for the previous property as BT did not disconnect the line on the date agreed. New tenant made international call which appeared on my bill and now it looks like I have to pay the bill and only after the bill is paid  make another contact with BT to claim it back.Another issue was when they promised me new BT hub  at first attempt they sent me some sort of plastic connector instead; on second attempt they sent BT hub to an old address; third time after I realised their mistake with the address  they cancelled the previous order and made a new one…..it turned out it was going to go to my old address as well. A fourth time I have lost it  and by the time I called them the hub was already despatched and it was too late to cancel it. During that call an advisor tried to talk me out of reordering hub 6 (the new one) as apparently there is not much difference to hub 5  oh! and that if I was going to go ahead with hub 6 I would have to pay for it. I have informed the person that the hub 6 was offered to me and I never asked for it  but since it was offered to me I got used to an idea of having better hub. After that hub 6 was delivered to my correct address free of charge. And 2 days after  we realised that BT Sport channels in HD do not work. Our subscription is in place but for some reason it is not being recognised  this happened after house move. So I started a chat with a person  they called me on my phone instead  transferred the call to another adviser who then transferred the call to another team (I think technical). It took 10min to talk to the first two people and I was on hold for the third transfer for almost 1.5h ….no one picked up and I have finally given up.~~~,West London~~~,2017-06-09~~~,1,1,3,2
I'm absolutely appalled with BT.. I would never recommend them for anything!! Absolutely shocking service  disgusting customer services.. I phoned to dispute a bill and they hung up on me after arguing with me! Now they have cancelled my account when I didn't want it cancelled.  Now charging me almost £700! Absolutely disgusting!!!~~~,Dumfries ~~~,2017-06-09~~~,1,1,1,1
If you are thinking of joining BT for their TV and phone services let me warn you that you will be wasting your time and money as their service is the pits of any provider in the country and even Talk Talk is a better option.Lousiest Broadband bandwith - can't even print wirelessly- Can't receive any advertised channels - HD quality is a joke - exorbitant telephony charges - rubbish customer service with useless remote call centre service - to name a few of the reasons you should steer clear of BT~~~,Orpington ~~~,2017-06-08~~~,1,1,1,1
I'm disgusted with BT at the moment my overall satisfaction is making me want to move to a different broadband  as soon as i possibly can. my bill is only supposed to be 43.00 and has gone up to 67.00  however i did go over the time limit on the phone. though this does not amount to the amount of money i have to pay. this has gave me much trouble and instead of my bills being 50.00 they have now gone up to 60.00  im not prepared to pay this amount of money anymore.~~~,southport~~~,2017-06-07~~~,1,5,2,1

BT has become a worse provider now a days. My internet has been doped more than a week now. Reported fault and gave an engineer visit appointment after a week. I couldn't go for my work that day. Unfortunately he didn't turn up. Called BT again. They said they have no idea what happened. Booked another appointment after 3 days following Monday. Again I didn't go for work waiting for the engineer. He didn't turn up that day too. Called again BT talked to their manager. He assured next day morning the engineer will visit. Didn't go for work waiting for the engineer. In the morning I called BT to ensure that he is coming or not. He said yes yes before 1 pm. No one came till 1:30. Called again they said it is next tuesday. Imagine  this is 11th days  I have no internet. They have suggested BT Fon  open network which is rubbish. So next appointment gave is for coming Thursday afternoon. Let us see. Dear all  do not choose BT again as they have degraded to lower than talk talk now a days.~~~,Yeovil~~~,2017-06-06~~~,1,1,3,1

We have recently had issues with broadband & so contacted the call centre to report a fault. WORST after sales I have ever encountered. The fault was reported over a week ago to which after a 1hr telephone call they appointed an engineer. He visited 3 days ago unsure why he was there as the 1hr call I had was not enough time to make any notes whatsoever. Still no broadband & no promised returned calls on the further two contacts made. The second contact consisted of a 40 minute call to establish my name & address  & only this! A complete joke!! Will be taking business elsewhere for sure. I hope nobody has to endure this pathetic excuse of a call centre but good luck if you do. Punjabi might be a good language to learn if wanting help with a technical issue.~~~,Stockport~~~,2017-06-05~~~,4,~~~,4,3
"I have had an absolute shambles with BT to try and get my internet switched from Plusnet to BT. I was given an activation date of 4th May and eventually got connected on 1st June. When I rang on 4th May  apparently my order did not go through to the supplier correctly  they then tried to redo the order and said I would have broadband on 11th May. However  no broadband connection on this date either. After much complaining I was assigned a ""case officer"" who told me system had messed up and only way to get internet was to cancel order and start again. Should be sorted by Monday 15th. Another call on Monday to apologise again but not sorted and they can't give me a date when it will. More complaining and started asking advisor about their ADR and had to be escalated to his manager as was out of depth. i have had to keep phoning for an update because no one bothers to call me. Just been told I have a ""marker"" on my line which will take another 5 days to remove so that my order can be placed again. Order was placed again and i eventually got internet 4 weeks late on 1st June. BT are a joke  never switch to them. I have seen numerous other similar complaint.~~~",Cheshire~~~,2017-06-02~~~,1,1,1,1
Worst service ever  after almost two weeks with a fault still waiting for some assistance.Will never recommend it to anyone~~~,London~~~,2017-06-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Really surprised with the quality of service provided by BT Broadband - as a first time customer when i was joining BT - i was promised a lot of things but when it came to delivery - they dropped the penny. Broadband Speed which I receive from BT is less than 1MB per second. When i called up customer care to complain they said the lowest ever speed will be 512Kb per sec. i was better of using a phone line modem to connect to Internet instead of using BT then. Will not recommend BT. I was charged from the time when BT had not even setup the connection and then going through customer care to explain it back to them was another step. So all in all not at all a great experience. Will not want to recommend BT based on my experience.~~~,Dagenham~~~,2017-06-02~~~,1,1,1,1
We've been with BT for more than four years now  in the last year our broadband has started to simply stop working at random times. This is not convenient for me as I often have to conduct online meetings with overseas offices from home. It came to the point where I have now moved to EE. However  in the last month of their service  once I had informed them that I would not renew the contract  the broadband simply stopped working for good  with the hub constantly flashing orange. It seems as if BT cut my broadband off before the end of the contract because I had upset them. This means I have had to pay more than £50 for broadband that I didn't receive this month. Beware of BT they will not play by the rules.~~~,"London, England ~~~",2017-05-31~~~,2,1,3,1

I signed because of 100 pounds prepaid MasterCard  which I have never received  when I tried to contact the customer service by email they said that they couldn't help and I need to call to the customer service. So I called  I waited 20 minutes to get to somebody just to be put on hold for another 10 minutes and then picked up by another member of staff that also put me on hold for 10 minutes. I waited 40 minutes to find out that my prepaid mastercard was not claimed and that they send me an email with instructions on how to claim it that I have never received. I am really dissatisfied with their attitude towards customers. Never again.~~~,Southampton~~~,2017-05-29~~~,1,1,1,2
Terrible  switched over to bt from sky hoping for fast and RELIABLE Internet but reliable is not what I have got.

Dont get it. The speeds terrible  I cant watch vides on my facebook because its so slow  I cant have more than two tabs open because it makes it too slow to use at all. They've ramped my bill right up to 40 pounds per month and that is not fibre optic! no phone landline used to make calls either so to have to pay that amount for the diabolical speed and service I am getting is completely unacceptable.~~~,North west uk~~~,2017-05-29~~~,2,2,1,2
infinity 2 capped by BT at less than their guaranteed speed. Foreign people on chat have no idea and send engineers to check internal wiring when they say it is external fault. Price is 50% dearer than some other providers and as a loyalty offer they want to charge £5 more than I am already paying.~~~,Huntingdon UK~~~,2017-05-29~~~,1,1,1,2
Previously with talk talk  after having my bank details leaked by them and the shocking customer service I decided to switch to bt fibre.  Called up and ordered  they cancelled my contract with talktalk on my behalf and even paid off the rest of my contract. Engineer visit took almost 2 weeks to come out but apparently I lived in a high workload area which is fair enough.  The speeds I get are brilliant  I get 71mbs with a cable and right now I'm sitting in the garden (3 rooms away) and getting 51mbs wireless speed.  I did have an issue with my phone line and when I called up  they found the issue straight away after a couple tests and sent an engineer to fix it.  I couldn't recommend BT highly enough!  They've been great~~~,Newcastle upon tyne~~~,2017-05-27~~~,5,5,5,4
Can't wait for my contract to end!!!! Customer service is so bad. I'm paying for the fibre but not getting the guaranteed speed. If I was to cancel early then I would have to pay!!! No one knows what they are talking about and either pass me on to a different department who then hangs up or tries to call me back on the home number during working times  even though I asked them to make a note to ring on my mobile after 6pm.  Do not recommend BT at all!!!!~~~,Chelmsford ~~~,2017-05-27~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
It's hard to know where to begin summarising the standard of service I've received from BT recently. It seems like I've been battling their total lack of competence since the dawn of time but I'll try and cast my mind back to what was a much simpler time in order to recount the full sordid story. To begin with I received a bill which charged me an extra £66 for 'excess broadband usage'. I called to query this and was informed by a delightfully self righteous woman that this couldn't be a mistake (I wish I could track her down now to point out the irony of this statement) and that there was no way of removing it from my bill. Not to be off put  I cancelled my standing order and raised a complaint in which I challenged the charge and asked for it to be removed. A week passed  no response. I called and was told somebody would be in touch. Another week passed by  the silence remained but alas my services did not. They were disconnected and ran headlong into the abyss from which they are yet to emerge. Eventually I received a missed call from BT while I was at work but no voicemail with a number to ring back on. The same thing happened the next day and then despite numerous phone calls to the main customer service line on my part I couldn't get through to speak to the complaint handler  who remained as elusive as Ronnie Briggs in the 80s. 2 months into this fiasco I was informed that the complaint had been closed  BT in their infinite wisdom clearly believing that when I stated their customer service was 'worse than being homeless' what I actually meant was 'I am happy for this to be withdrawn without compensation or resumption of services'. I'm sure we can all spot the similarities between the two comments. Finally  a week later  and with my desire for a move to a pre technological village in the Amazon rainforest growing stronger by the minute  BT accepted liability for the mistake and agreed to waive the outstanding balance on my account. Remarkably  the BT customer care machine now went into reverse and having excelled at providing a level of service even the mass murdering General Pinochet would have found disrespectful  they started falling over themselves to make it even worse. First I was told my services had not been disconnected but cancelled outright which meant I would have to be treated as a new customer and would be charged a £40 installation fee on top of waiting a week to be connected. Likening this charge to an assault victim being head butted at his own compensation review meeting I succeeded in having it removed (I stopped short of throwing a celebratory street party). I was then sent a hub. The hub was in fact the wrong kind. I was then sent another hub. The new and improved model did not work. Eager to play my part in resolving this omnishambles I took a day off work in order to wait around for an engineer to come and identify the problem but in a rare moment of oversight on BT's part the appointment couldn't go ahead due to 'insufficient resources and a heavy workload'. in a display of gratitude which touched my weary soul they decided to inform me of this 30 minutes after the 5 hour window for the engineer's arrival had elapsed. And so here we are. I'm now told another appointment can't be scheduled until next week and just so I was in no doubt about my own role in this farce  I've just been reminded by text that if the Internet fault turns out to be the result of the wiring or phone socket in my house then I will owe BT £129 to cover the cost of the  as yet untraceable  engineer. Fair enough I'd say given the way they've nurtured me through this difficult period with the care and attention of a first time mother. I may one day be connected to the internet again. Or maybe by that time the Internet age will have passed us by. Either way  BT are a joke. Avoid them at all costs.~~~,Edinburgh~~~,2017-05-26~~~,1,1,1,1

Quite frankly - a very poor overall service with support staff unable to answer the most basic of questions. Fault response - expect 24hour delays even when dealing with business accounts.

I hate the fact that you enter into a 12 month contract with them at a fixed price and they unilaterally decide to increase your bills by 10%. Because you are in a contract with them there is nothing you can do to get out of it other than paying the excessive early cancellation penalties. I can't even cancel after 12 months as they say you need to give them 30 days notice but that if you give it to them before the end of your contract they count this as your cancellation date and charge you for the equipment under early cancellation effectively holding you hostage. Bunch of thieves!~~~,London~~~,2017-05-24~~~,1,1,2,4
AVOID  terrible router. Terrible customer service. I have a faulty BT Home Hub 4.0. I was persuaded to switch to BT from Sky by a sales person. Sounded great. The reality is different. I was sent a faulty BT Hub 4.0 - the hub they send as standard  We can’t connect to it wirelessly for longer than a couple of hours. It disconnects regularly and struggles to reconnect once disconnected. This is when we are sat in the same room as the router. The internet connection coming into the house is fine  we know this as it was a perfect service when we were with sky and they use the same broadband lines. We know the internet connects with the router it’s the wireless part of the chain that is the issue. The BT router is in exactly the same place as our sky router used to be and we are using the same devices to connect to it. The only variable that could be causing the issue is the router. There are thousands of complaints about fault home hub 4.0 routers online. Wish I’d researched before switching from sky. After speaking with customer care I was told “We don’t guarantee a wireless service  we are an internet service” which was such a kick in the teeth. Of course I thought I would have wireless when I agreed to switch my internet provider.  “Our systems are showing the HUB is not faulty”. Of course from BT’s end everything looks fine as they know that internet is coming into the house and reaching the router. It’s wireless part o the chain which obviously BT can’t test from their office. We are not getting sent a stable wireless signal from our faulty router and we can’t use the service properly as a result.  I asked for a replacement Hub  they said no. “We can’t send out a free router”. Terrible response. I said due to the hub 4.0 complaints. We are completely unsatisfied. AVOID. Go with Sky always.~~~,London~~~,2017-05-23~~~,1,1,1,1
THE UPGRADE THAT DOWNGRADED MY BROADBAND.Upgraded my Broadband from 13MBS to the fastest available in my area 22MBs. When the switch over day came broadband down to 0.2MBs!!!. Engineer came out to check what is wrong. I have been put on an old telephone line that is 11Km long  instead of the 2KM one that went to a local fibre cabinet that I was using before. I rang BT and they say I was always on the 11Km line the engineer has tested your line and there is nothing wrong with it!!!! I could never have achieved the 12MB speeds I said. I told them I had a VDSL line before and now I am switched to a ADSL line. They do not even know what I am talking about. They said what is VDSL?. 5 hours on the phone and am no closer to getting their big mistake fixed. Wish I had not bothered trying to get an upgrade.~~~,UK~~~,2017-05-22~~~,1,1,1,1
I've just changed my broadband fibre package from talktalk to BT Infinity & TV. The change over was on the 17/05/2017  BT kept me informed as to when the Hub ect. would arrive  & that my landline phone would be disconnected for a while until they reconnected it. I set the infinity Hub & youview up myself & when I turned them on we were up & running  so I connected my smart TVs & computers & everything is working perfectly.  So far I'm well impressed.~~~,Fareham~~~,2017-05-20~~~,5,5,5,5
"In an age where most compete on service in some ways it is interesting to find an organisation that has true contempt for their customers. BT pines for the time when it was a monopoly and is genuinely bewildered by the concept of customer service. It has been 58 days since I was definitely promised an engineer visit to install my BT fibre-to-the-premises  I have been treated to 39 days of ""executive level complaint handling"" and I am absolutely no closer to receiving any service whatsoever from this organisation. They just cancelled a promised engineer visit yesterday because a pole is rotten. They failed to spot this when conducting a very much delayed survey. A couple of times a week I will get a ""I am investigating what further on-going work is required"" message but the only advance that occurred was when I sent them a photo of trees that had been trimmed as they are utterly unable to find this out for themselves.  With executive level complaint handling I receive incompetence and unprofessionalism  it makes me wonder what you get with basic level complaint handling. Do they add arson?~~~",Wales~~~,2017-05-20~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Renewed 12-month contract with BT to maintain the discount. They said everything would be the same except I could expect slightly faster broadband. When the new contract started the Broadband stopped working and I am left with a flashing DSL LED. Called their help desk and was told I needed to wait 48 hours before the service would start working and they were going to do nothing in those 48 hours to help. Children were off school for study leave had to take them to the local library so they could study. I work from home and had to sit in my car at a local car park and use my phone as a hotspot so I could work as the 3G is useless where I live.  After 48 hours still no broadband. Called the help desk (it sounded like a call centre in India) they said I needed to stay on the phone while they tested the line. During the test the line went dead and I was left with only the dial tone  they did not call be back. After hours of waiting I called again and explained what happened. They looked at the notes and said I had put the phone down on the support parson during the test so that’s why they did not call back! They then started querying how I had my name spelling on the account name saying that is not how my name should be spelled. They also had my house number wrong in the system they were now using they had everything correct except they had the wrong house number. This support person was extremely rude to me (it sounded like a call centre in India) They tested the line and said it was fine I must have done something to stop it from working. They were unable to help and were even describing the hub and open reach modem incorrectly telling me there were not the ports on it I was seeing. They said they would send out an engineer to have a look. The following day I looked online when I was using my phone as a hotspot and on the BT site  the fault said it was fixed. I called them again and was told to stop calling them! they were dealing with it!!. I called them the following day to confirm an engineer was coming as their website said there was a fault and when I clicked on the link it said the fault was fixed  they had a look and said they could not see any appointment for an engineer. I asked them were they sure. I told them when the engineer was supposed to be coming and they then said they could now see the appointment.  So far no broadband or engineer. I have spent countless hours waiting it queues as their automated system says we are extremely bust at the moment. The children have to keep going to the library to use broadband as their homework’s are posted on Show My Homework website. I cannot do my work properly I need to keep going out in my car to find a good 3G/4G hotspot. I told BT I worked from home but they are doing nothing at all to help me! I would advise everyone to avoid BT at all costs they are a nightmare to deal with.~~~,Antrim~~~,2017-05-20~~~,1,1,1,1

BT unable to complete my order  been waiting over a month.BT claim they initially made the wrong order and failed to inform me the order was cancelled. Only found out of the issue after calling BT to ask when will the engineer arrive  they claimed they never put it through even though they sent me email confirmation of the order and when engineer will arrive to set up the box. Later they claim they need to re order the package and will receive a call from one of the advisor confirming if it's completed. got a call to say it's now complete and will be ready next day. This went on for 4 days after which BT claim the advisors did not take correct steps as there are issues with Open Reach. So now been told I have to sit tight and wait until someone gets back to me. Absolutely speechless and so frustrating  this is the second time it's happened to me. First time I waited 6 weeks so eventually decided to go with a different provider  this time I don't have any choice as it seems BT are the only providers for Fibre.~~~,London~~~,2017-05-17~~~,1,1,1,1

I moved from talk talk to bt at the end of my contract as there was a good offer.  I have only been with bt 13 days and spent more phone time with them than i did with talk talk in 18 months.  First they are denying the offers of £150  then my broad band speed is below 1 and when i try to cancel the contract they are saying that the 14 days grace are from the order date not when the equipment is installed.  This does not make sense as surely one must have the 14 days trial from the installation date~~~,aberdare~~~,2017-05-16~~~,1,1,1,1
It took us 6 plus months to get broadband then in Feb 6 months later would you believe a price rise stocking  service when we called asking why every month or bill was different they said it's because of your phone use well I almost wet myself as we never use the phone now the operator is stuck for word's and says she will get someone to call us asap guess what ..... that's right no MY ADVICE IS AVOID AT ALL COSTS~~~,Pontefracr~~~,2017-05-16~~~,1,1,1,5
