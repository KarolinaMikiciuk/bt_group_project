Worst service provider I have ever had to deal with!!! Slow unreliable broadband. Called to complain several times  eventually after the 4th time calling they reluctantly sent an engineer  inform me the appointment is between 8am and 1pm. Took a day off work  waited and waited and waited. The engineer turns up at 2pm!!!! Unapologetic  he claims he was the appointment was for 2pm!!! WORST COMPANY EVER!!!! AVOID IF YOU CAN. You are kept waiting on the phone for 30 mins plus. WE ARE NOW MOVING OUR BROADBAND ELSEWHERE!~~~,London ~~~,2016-02-29~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Don't touch BT. They have admitted to me on the phone their BT Hub has problems with Apple products. They simply hide behind the ombudsman and are not interested in getting to the bottom of the problem. I have lost a lot of money due to BT.~~~,Essex~~~,2016-02-29~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is the rubbish company running in Endlang  not organised  liars  they are ripping me off. Cancelling my line without my permission and information and cut my £604.00 from my account. They cancel my line because some stupid and idiot company called them and they happily agree without informing me I will complain this matter to ofcom and I'll make sure I'll take them to court and will get my compensation for that.My advice to everyone dont ever go with BT~~~,harrow~~~,2016-02-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Tried to place an order over 6 times over a period of 4 months. Kept waiting for things to activate. Each time  after waiting 1-2 weeks after the activation date  I would ring them asking them why it was not activated. I was told it was a 'technical issue' and they kept blaming my current provider of having 'tags on the line'. Why did they not bother to follow up with me after problems had arisen? Eventually  got sick of it and I moved over to Sky who managed to change my telephone and broadband over in one smooth transaction. BT are an absolute joke.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2016-02-28~~~,1,1,1,1
Paradoxically  I was glad to see so many reviews rubbishing BT  I thought it was just me!I won't go in to the probs I'm having with them  suffice it to say  I'm the same as everyone else!Why on Earth don't BT read these review pages!It all seems so simple.1. Man the help lines with people who are fluent in good English.2. Provide the service its customers are paying for.3. Admit it is in the wrong where appropriate and refund customers they have failed.4. Acknowledge receipt of feedback where due. All customers who are dissatisfied with them should avoid all the balleywho of using help and feedback etc. and should start bringing the matters to Gavin Patterson (CEO) personally by snail mail letter if nec..Maybe if we started leaving in decent numbers and refused to pay severance fees (I don't understand why these can be due if they haven't provided the promised service) making them proceed thro' court cases by the hundred/thousand  they would start paying attention!By the way  looking thro' the alternatives on various review sites  I am at a loss to see who is the best provider  everyone of them appears to be rubbish - any ideas?~~~,Ayrshire~~~,2016-02-27~~~,2,1,1,1

Nothing like what they sell you. This service is not fit for purpose. Customer service may be very good  if you can understand the people at the call centre. The staff often put the phone down on you because you have to keep asking them to repeat themselves to try and work out how to sort out the numerous defects with the equipment. If you are thinking of changing  don't bother Virgin is far  far better. BT is an acronym for Bl**dy Terrible~~~,London~~~,2016-02-25~~~,1,1,1,1
Extremely disappointing broadband speed: very unreliable and definitely under par of what I am supposed to get (up to 76Mb  according to BT).~~~,Bexleyheath~~~,2016-02-25~~~,2,2,2,2
I subscribed to BT Infinity 1 on Sunday and already I have received absolute diabolical service - I am absolutely astounded they get any business at all - I am going to cancel my order... and why cant I write on their facebook probably because they want to hide that fact they don't know the first thing about customer service!!! Anyone thinking of swapping over I would strongly suggest they think twice and then again because you haven't received diabolical customer service until you have to deal with this lot!!!~~~,Bolton ~~~,2016-02-24~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
"BT Possibly the worst company I have dealt with for receiving broadband and tv.Placed order in January now end of February still no broadband or tv.They are cheaper for a reason. ""Very poor customer service/care ""Overall Experience Please remember that their tv runs of the broadband so if your broadband is slow you will get buffering also no broadband no paid for tv channels will work. Engage with them at your peril i'd rather pay more for to get consistency of servicequality of productand good quality customer care.

Despite being informed by BT that we should be getting speeds up to at least 20mb/s  we are lucky to get 6 for downloads and 2 for uploads. No one seems that bothered when questioned about it but they still insist on charging for a service that isn't fit for purpose~~~,WATTON~~~,2016-02-21~~~,2,2,1,2
Ordered broadband about 5 times and 5 times they have messed up the order saying ‘it's a technical issue’. Sales department misled so much about product  you can’t help be disappointed with results.Was promised 35MB download speed  router only connected at 20MB with a through put of 14MB.  Home Hub 5 was noisy when in use; sounded like something was fizzing inside  was concerned about it catching fire.  BT sent me a new one but this one was exactly the same.  Router was always rebooting.Overly all experience: expensive company that is overly aggressive  and fails to deliver.This service was costing me £32pcm + line rental.  It included all telephone calls but BT always found a way to charge me for additional calls.Change to EE; a hassle free experience; speed is now 31MB (EE only promised 22MB – nice to see a Company offer realistic speeds and then beating them  rather than lie on what can be achieved). Cost is £15pcm + line rental.  Includes all telephone calls; including calls to mobile and international calls.  Zero noise from router.~~~,South West~~~,2016-02-21~~~,1,2,2,1
I went to bt on a promise of better broad band and better service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I was cohersed by very convincing sales pater to believing I was going to receive a better service!!!!!!!!!!!  what a load of rubbish  all I can say is don't go with bt.

2016 - just signed up with BT broadband BIG MISTAKE They want to charge me £170 to cancel the contract !My speed is only 1mb ! And I only get 10 gig per month for £5  when you try to upgrade to unlimited they tell you it's £18 per month and you won't get a  speed increase ! So it's not unlimited then is it  I know people who can download in a couple of hours what takes me 1 week ! Also the customer service is terrible  they email you but you can't email them back  you have to call and they are of no help. £170 to cancel I've only been with them 20 days.MY ADVICE IS STAY WELL AWAY FROM BT~~~,Wisbech~~~,2016-02-19~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
They advertise they have the best hub  well actually the worst I think. My wifi keeps playing up. I should be getting 38Gb/s. Sometimes the speed drops down to 1-5 Gb/s. They did try to fix it over the phone. Still the same. Unexpected speed drops. Total disaster. Expensive mistake. Going back to sky shortly.~~~,Littlehampton~~~,2016-02-18~~~,1,2,1,1

"I've been with BT for 23 years for phone and took out BT broadband in 2013 when it came with ""free"" BT Sport.  Last year they started charging me £5 a month for this ""free' service.  I tried to cancel it on their website only to go round in many loops and circles before finding out that its not possible and you have to call them - shoddy tactics. I called to cancel it.  Was told I'd have to pay next month's charge anyway as it's 30 days notice.  Waited 15 minutes on hold to speak with a supervisor only to be told that they'd call me back.  They did - would not budge (I later found out t that Ofcom had told BT to refund customers who asked for this which they had been doing).   He got a sales person to call me to give me a better deal to make up for it.  I was offered £10.85 instead of £18 for broadband.  I said no on the basis that they are offering the same to new customers for £5 pm.  Pretty insulting offer really and they clearly don't care about customer retention.~~~",Woking~~~,2016-02-17~~~,1,1,4,3
I have just switched to BT from Plusnet. Its probably the worst thing I have ever done.1. They messed up the order and I have had 1Mb instead of 7Mb for over a week (and counting)since I switched. They basically ordered a Bussiness 1000 line which is capped to 1Mb.2. I took the whole package but they didnt make it clear when ordering that unless you have 10Mb you dont get the free BT sports.4. The service desk is a joke. They appear to continually want to test your line and then relate what you already know. My belief is they just read from a script. If you are considering BT my advice would be dont.~~~,Norwich~~~,2016-02-16~~~,2,2,1,3
Worst ever mistake joiningBroadband still not workingHad taken nearly four weeks to installStill a fault with the apparently third party Wait 10 minutes to speak to help on the chatThen 1 hour on the phone being passed around to Order team  tech team then back to order managementStill no resolution! Apparently the broadband team also have us on the end of their start list. Why?? They say it wont start until another week and half!!!How do BT keep their customers with such bad serviceI regret joining BT and paying a upfront feeStill waiting for a call back one hour and a half later~~~,West London~~~,2016-02-15~~~,1,1,1,1
I joined BT on the 7th December 2015 and was very happy until 6th January 2016 when my phone line and wifi went off  After lots of calls from me to bt and promises the service would be working the next day after 5 days the phone line was fixed but we still have no wifi 2 months on. We keep getting told it will be next week and when that week and date comes we then get told yet again next week. I give up with them. What a waste of time.~~~,South Yorkshire~~~,2016-02-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Horrific company to deal with. Avoid BT. I was with Onetel for years and they were actually better. Sadly for me I am locked into this contract for now but will end it as soon as I can. My broadband which is unlimited (supposedly) is functional less than half the time and very slow- I live in central London. All my attempts to resolve it are met with a non response. I even have a reference number for the complaint but they don't ever call me back. I have had three scheduled ring backs that never happened. They even lied and said they couldn't get through when I gave two numbers and kept both lines open. They take plenty of money from me and say customer service is a priority- well no wonder my broadband stinks since its even less important to them than the appalling customer service they don't provide. I am unable to use my smart TV for Netflix etc ok not the end of the world but not great when I am paying for it  and my student son is unable to use Moodle or upload essays by deadline- thanks BT!~~~,London~~~,2016-02-14~~~,1,1,2,1

Perhaps if BT were paid consistent with the manner with which they provide broadband service  - intermittently  slowly  and without recourse - they would take service more seriously.

I seriously don't even know where to start. Choosing BT was the biggest mistake of my life  paying £50-£90 odd pounds every month for the sevice that I got promised till date not received is absolutely ridiculous! Everytime I call about the speed of the wifi and the connection which drops 24/7  they make me spend an hour trying to explain myself and then half an hour trying to refresh the background through my laptop which still makes no difference at all. Spent hours and hours speaking on calls to seniors  complaints  managers etc but nothing gets resolved. Don't waste your time by choosing BT when's there's much better options out there. It's not even worth half a star!~~~,Scotland ~~~,2016-02-10~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

I made the foolish mistake of switching to BT from my broadband and phone line supplier over 12 mths ago  from the beginning it was a catalogue of errors and hassle.  It started with my phone not enabling us to phone out! after hours on an offshore call centre getting nowhere with someone who knew absolutely nothing about BT services & how they worked  and was quick frankly rude!! I gave up after 2 days.  My partner eventually found the solution on a forum of disgruntled BT customers!! eventually after 3 mths BT resolved the issue! my broadband speed was pretty useless most of the time and stuck with the contract I pushed on until it was due to expire.  I was then shocked to see a debit for over double go out of my bank account with no warning ! Yes right on expiry good old BT with no warning stuck me on a tariff that basically ripped me off for double the amount! no email  no paperwork warning me my contract was due for renewal! I have since switched and surprise surprise BT can now email and write asking me to stay and offering a different contract! i should really contest the last 2 debits taken but I do not have the heart or the courage to try and ring their god awful call centre in India! It is by far the worst I have ever encountered! my advice is stay clear of BT  poor service  no customer care and quick to charge and debit you when without any warning! glad to be rid of their rubbish broadband and phone package!! oh and don't try and complain on their BT homepage or forum! they never respond and ignore you!!~~~,Truro~~~,2016-02-09~~~,1,1,~~~,2
I ordered bt broadband and tv on the 25/11/2015  I had to call them to point out an error on the order  I then got sucked into the bt call centre run around  2 days later I decided to cancel my order  well within my cooling off period  it is now the 9/2/2015  well over 2 months after my initial contact and bearing in mind that I never actually became a bt customer and I have just managed to shake them off  they have made final demands for money they was never owed  taken money from my account that they were never entitled to take  and don't even get me onto the off shore call centres  if you do mange to pull one of the robots off his or her script they can become quite aggressive. well I can now breath a sigh of relief and it`ll be an experience that I will  never repeat~~~,milton keynes~~~,2016-02-09~~~,1,1,~~~,~~~
From a customer service point of view  BT is by far the worse provider I have ever experienced. Took them 2 months to get my broadband + sports working after multiple engineer appointments and infinite time spent on the phone and online chat. Had I not been pro-active  I'm afraid I would still be awaiting for my service activation. It has been a very frustrating experience. As soon as my contract ends I'll be moving out.~~~,London~~~,2016-02-08~~~,1,1,4,4
I've got to say the BT broadband/TV itself is really fast and reliable ever since it was connected. I'm using it for web surfing  cable TV and streaming. Down side is that their phone and online chat service is a mess. Overall 4 star I think it's fair.~~~,Tonbridge~~~,2016-02-08~~~,4,2,5,5
O Stars   I have been around the world on the phone since Friday 22nd January 2016 With a greeting of business hours Monday 9am to Friday 5pm    I have Business BB with no support from any part of BT On Monday I was on to call centres for 3 Hour being passed about   with employees just hanging up  because they can not check out any problems you have   they are not allowed to look up your order  your account  they can not give you an email to write to  can not accept any scanned documents from you showing your order  is this for real.  BT is the worse service in the world  (with out prejudice) in my opinion.   Its a joke    the saying   goes I am trying my best to help you  a statement all the operators use and then finally just I will pass you on to another department   they will help you  and guess what  back in a queue for another 30 minutes  and the same all over again.   The call centres can treat the customers any way they like.  I t is actually  because they can not help you as the service BT provides is disgustingly atrocious  the call centre personnel  really can not do anything to help anyway.   so they just give up and drop the call   How many people have experienced this.  What can be done about it   as BT just ignores the state of play the company is in.    So So So badly organised and managed.   I would not work for a company like that.    If the centres where all in Britain  this would not be happening as the Managers would have it running better.    The mistakes just keep going on and on    just a monster of  the worst communication provider in the world.  They can not sort problems out  they would not know where to begin.  Our problems are on going and after the initial order was signed we are still waiting for the full order with phone still not here  part of the order was for a cloud phone  they cancelled their visit 5 times since 6 January  changed the phone no 3 times and its still not happened.   I don't need to tell you every annoying phone call   as I am sure if you are reading this    you have been there also.    I will say I have came across 3 uk personnel at the call centres with excellent customer service  but they are unable to fix problems also .  And try and retrieve a password for an old email address   which they sent the order to  and we can not access that either  its just a monster of a company that out of control   But we are stuck with them   Is there any better options  that are as reliable as the Great BT Company   it really is a JOKE.~~~,~~~,2016-02-06~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
I am so happy to see so many negative reviews on BT. Based on my experience  they all seem to be true. I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND BT TO ANYONE. I will not take their service even if it is free. They charged more for what I've used  when called the response was cold and took a long time to sort out. When I decided to leave BT  a customer service representative called me who was absolutely rude and I felt like being interrogated.  Take my advice  never take any service from BT even if free.~~~,Pontypool~~~,2016-02-06~~~,1,1,1,1
My broadband has been ok. However there was a problem when I wanted to add a new device to my broadband.  Partly my own fault as I lost my password... however trying to get a reset is absolutely impossible!  The Internet page is completely useless and you have to wait over 40 mins for an answer from 1 of the 4 people who work there and the automated services is a complete joke.~~~,Rhymney~~~,2016-02-06~~~,3,1,4,3
Just a poor level or service delivery  I mean all the adverts boasting about the fastest internet etc..  My average download line speed is 1 mb i mean that's awful compared to the country average of around 17 mb. Just not happy!!~~~,Soberton~~~,2016-02-05~~~,1,1,1,1
"Bt what can I say? I went with them two years ago to get the TV as infinity had been instead and Virgin couldn't give us TV. The pallaver to get the broadband  phone and TV installed an running was unbelievable with endless calls to BT and the so called technical centre in India [ who to be fair at the time did at least call back ] even though they couldn't fix the problem of a ""stuck"" order. The whole thing had to be cancelled at started over again and still there were delays and letters asking me to return equipment which didn't need to be returned. Eventually it was  all sorted  [ but it took around  4 weeks to get everything working properly anf=d hours frustration on the phone to polite but useless people who didn't or couldn't keep their   promises or  who couldn't understand  the issues ] .Since then the broadband and TV service has been fine  with speeds as promised of 38mb. Prices have however risen considerably over time . Recently  they wrote to me putting up the charges saying if I didn't take out another contract with them they were going to charge me around £7 more and would  no longer get Sport lite [ which I don't watch anyway ] .I called BT  after getting quotes from  other suppliers and they kindly  agreed to offer me the current service plus BT sport for considerably less than Talk Talk  or Sky -  I was happy again or so i thought . Then the problems began .  The BT sport duly arrived the next day   and I called their sales team to ask if i could have the HD channel bolt on . You would have though this simple request but no . This was agreed and an order submitted told it would take probably a couple of hrs but at worst it would be 24 max. No HD channelled 24 hrs later - nada. Called 150 [ long wait and user automated system  with a Scottish lady telling me how important my call was and would  i like to use their web site which proudly announced ""sorry for the delay"" and gave information none of which was relevant or did not solve the issue ]  .On getting through to the Oders team or tech dept or who ever they were  the saga with their Indian call centre began. 150 answered and after a further  interminable wait to muzak was put through the  ] I  have called them 5 times and on each occasion i have been assured the service will start and on two occasions  would be called back as they were personally  monitoring my order . I have to say no such calls were  ever received and  I am still without the HD version of the channels [ at one pointI even   lost the exisitng  internet / non hd channels but miraculously they were restored 6 hours later  ].I have had to spend hours on the phone waiting and explaining to some very polite but disingenuous and ineffective staff who have basically fobbed e off with a load of old tripe and unfulfilled promises [ lies I suppose ]. Even one of the women at the call centre told me SHE had been cut off by the Orders Dept. Every time   you must speak to a different person and they all parott  the same script but despite promises  they don't solve your problem - which in my case  where is my order ? In frustration I googled the  BT's CEO e mail adress   [ Gaivn Patterson ]  and wrote to him . This at least resulted in  a prompt reply although I suspect it was probably computer generated since it arrived about 9pm in the evening  but was singed from ""Gavin"". All very mately  I suppose he can afford to be but since Iv e never met him and he's not my friend  Ifound this a rather superficial and dare I say it American overly familiar way  to sign off to  a customer and shareholder { why? I am seriously asking the question ]  ....I have now been passed to the Executive Support Team [ whoever they are ]  to claim to be taking ownership of the problem  and not to contact any else in BT as they might get confused [  from my experience that would be a racing certainly] .The  claim they will get back soon ... we will see.  I pointed out MR patterson that  surveys by Which ? and others  show BT a the t bottom of the league for customer service and that  now I had experienced the reality  of BT I was in full agreement.  I have  also loolked  at heir website on quality issues and they have all the  mamagmetn speak  and about stuff programmes to improve service   Quaky assurance   ISO9001 .[In my epxpereicne the assurance rating is  useless since basically BT set the standard they want to meet  -    one it seems that is not very challenging  - and then  they get accredited because they can meet it!] .tere was aloud off giiif about customer care building ""shareholder value""  to persuade gullible  persons to invest with what is basically the  a privatised  PO telephones service monopoly  writ large and with a similar level of service to boot.  Whilst I have been happy wth the broadband which has lived up to expectations I cannot sy the same for their  customer service  problem solving  and their call centres  which are  the worst Ive ever experienced { although Vodafone on occasions have  come  a close second . ]  I would be loath to recommend BT to anyone they are simply too large . [NB 17 years ago my PC got infected with an autodialler virus and BT allowed my quarterly phone bill to get to neatly £500 - it was normally about £40  - before someone contacted  me . They had already paid the fraudsters in Vanuatu for frusdent calls I hadn't made and refused refund  me anything.  Ofcom were useless  too   although I later discovered I could have sued BT to get the money back . I left them immediately and swore I'd never go back. I should have stuck with Virgin or gone to Sky . The only reason I went back to BT was  because  wanted improved   TV and broadband and didn't want   a sky dish on my house - however that would  have been be a small price to pay given the problems I've had with thier call centres. Why do these companies think outsourcing to India or wherever will improve their service ? I suspect it is all  about saving money of course and not as they claim building ""shareholder value""  I am sure there are plenty of location in England who would welcome BT establishing a call centre there.  It is British telecom after all  and not Asian Telecom.   Don't bother with BT if you have an alternative  - if you have problem they are simply dreadful and their cal centre  staff even lie to you [very politely ]but lie is still a lie   - anything to get you to hang up  . Awful  and I have shares in this company must be mad  ! [ They are soon to be sold ].~~~",Surrey ~~~,2016-02-05~~~,1,1,4,4
