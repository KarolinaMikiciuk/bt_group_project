With the introduction of BT Infinity 2  I was given an estimate of 57Mbs download and 20Mbs upload. I am consistently getting 70+Mbs down and 14 - 17.5Mbs up.  Very pleased with the sevice.  Line profile did vary by 20% in first 3-4 days but has now stabilised at 77Mbs+~~~,Lancaster~~~,2012-05-01~~~,5,3,5,5
This speed has slipped from 6mbps to less than 2mbps~~~,spalding~~~,2012-04-19~~~,3,3,2,2
0.078 Mbps speed test says it all and only five miles from Oxford city centre in a decent sized village! BT are the only provider available and have done nothing to improve the service  yet charge double that of other quality suppliers. 1 Mbps would be adequate  to get less than 10% of that means a simple page like this takes 20 seconds to load.~~~,Noke~~~,2012-01-07~~~,1,1,1,1
i pay £28 a month for this crap of mine..!! what a shame  b.t. have let me down big time. iam so annoyed..!! it wont even reach a mere 1 mbps. what a disgrace. pls help.~~~,high street north~~~,2011-11-02~~~,1,2,1,1
I have had a couple of problems with my Broadbandover the past couple of years with BT. However on contacting them my problems have been dealt with efficiently and quickly. On the last occasion they even sent an engineer around the next morning and as a result my broadband was back online faster than ever. They may be a bit more expensive than some other providers but service they offer is worth every penny. I certainly can recommend BT.~~~,Newhey - Rochdale~~~,2011-10-18~~~,4,5,3,4
Far too slow when I am only a mile and a half from Cupar Exchange. BT give little comfort and seem to be able to change the speeds from 0.1 to 1.33 !!~~~,"cupar, fife~~~",2011-08-21~~~,1,2,1,3
bt broadband infinity ???it takes an infinity to get online and then takes an infinity to open a webpage  my average speed 0.2meg and im lucky if it stays connected for more than 15 min at a time  bts excuse the wire from the cabinet to my house is too old and in poor condition  they will replace it if i pay.~~~,Leeds~~~,2011-07-29~~~,1,1,1,1
BT is terrible! Been on it for years with a up to 8meg package  10 GB max bandwidth and my local area with bt is 3mps  while my actual speed with bt is 1-300kbps! I've contacted BT on many occasions but they ignore me and tell me it's my fault  my problem... even when I moved house  changed equipment etc - BT sucks! Stuck with a terrible connection  their customer services are the worst and atm the connection drops out A LOT! Worst time was keeping disconnecting and reconnecting constantly for hours - so no connection! My opinion  DON'T USE BT! Unreliable  slow speeds  bad customer service and overall ... bad!~~~,East London~~~,2011-07-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Periodic problems with Broadband speed dropping from over 6Mb/s to 1.5Mb/s. Repeated calls to customer service  and interminable waits in automated telephone sytem  bring promises of corrective action from 'an engineer will call' on 'date and time' to 'fault is at the Exchange and will be corrected in next few days. No improvement has resulted. Fed up with being treated like somebody who does not matter. Equally fed up with BT's general attitude to me as a customer  including the Highway Robbery of demanding extra money for not setting up a Direct Debit with them. And they think  after the fiascos of trying to get some action on Broadband speeds  I would trust them with a free hand to raid my Bank Account!!!!~~~,Southampton~~~,2011-06-20~~~,3,1,1,2
Crap! Speeds at one tenth the so called best in our area. The advertising just goes on telling lies and there's always the getout of 'up to ...'~~~,Barnsley~~~,2011-06-15~~~,1,1,1,1
I have been with BT for a number of years  they promised infinity last year  just been told it will be another six months! I can hardly finish a game on FIFA 11 without it dropping. I'm moving to sky  I like the look of anytime +~~~,London~~~,2011-06-08~~~,3,1,1,5
BT are providing me with a  terrible broadband service.Now down to 0.13 speed. Whenever I complain  to them about the poor quality of service  they promise everything  and do nothing. I am still waiting for a refund from them for no telephone or broadband for two weeks in Jan.2011. They have promised to refund my money 3 times  but they just tell lies. I wish I had cable laid in my road so that I could get Virgin.~~~,~~~,2011-05-21~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
A good quality service and value for money. Have tried others and BT are the best.~~~,Cannock~~~,2011-05-21~~~,5,5,5,5

In Feb 2011 I was getting a speed of 6909 since then it has dropped to 720I have contacted BT and cannot seem to get a improvement~~~,Cornwall~~~,2011-05-05~~~,1,2,1,3
Best performance is 1.8Mbps; the last 3 days 135Kbps; rang to complain got to Indian callcentre (english spoken very poor) may take 10 days to fix!!Poor service.~~~,Wroxham~~~,2011-04-26~~~,1,1,1,1
Awful  constantly lied to when phoning up.  Speed was 4.3M for a few weeks then they decided that a paying customer should only have 2.8M Yet I am  not a heavy user.  These jokers give the min speed they have to.~~~,spalding~~~,2011-04-07~~~,1,2,1,2
"Using the same equipment (Line Computers & wiring ) as previous provider ( Plusnet ) but BTs' wireless Hub 3 - used wired Cat5 - my overall speed and 'reliability' and lack of tech support went from Bad to Appalling.New Delhi Call Centre is the best thing about BTs' ""service""  !Another ""Non Customer Facing"" outfit where THEY contact YOU  but YOU cannot contact THEM without devoting hours and hours to phone calls - email contact not allowed !!I have a 25% DOWNTIME record so far - and counting.....THEY (BT) are VERY GOOD at sending out BILLS - pity their service lacks value IMHO.~~~",Sidlesham~~~,2011-04-06~~~,2,~~~,1,1
Good service from BT but cabling needs upgrading and therefore very slow broadband in the area~~~,Bedford~~~,2011-04-05~~~,3,4,1,4
BT  very disappointing.  When the Broadband works I'm getting nearly 3 Mb (woohoo) - guess what?  It's flaky as hell and drops to 1.4 Mb regularly which takes a really long phone call to India and escalation before (yet again) it's accpeted as an issue at the SP end and they sort it within 24 hours - during this time it drops to 1.4 Mb which doesn't support the BT Vision package (what I'm bloody well paying for!!!).  BT - you really need to sort your 'stuff' out - my Mrs is totally against getting Sky but she's coming round to it very quickly....SKY HD  sports...footy...hmmm.... I'm telling you  you're gonna have to sort it out damn quick to keep me as a customer...~~~,West Hallam~~~,2011-03-16~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~

absolutely useless 20/02/2011 speed 0.13mbps they tell you engineer is working on it. no results on improvement since oct 2010. i will change asap~~~,Leicester~~~,2011-02-20~~~,1,1,1,1
Switched from Pipex to BT I was told it would be faster but no real difference. The switching process was awful BT in breech of contract twice legals pending. Customer service absolute chaos Mind you so was pipex  talk talk. No money has been invested in Axminster exchange for years total rip off for what you get.~~~,Axminster~~~,2011-01-27~~~,3,2,2,3
A complete and utter waste of money. Poor speed of 58.Mbps. Terrible customer care/service and you get put through to India to people who can't understand a word you say. I am paying for a service that has crashed twice in a year the first being a local exchange problem that took 10 days to fix  with lots of fobbing off by customer service in between.~~~,Glasgow~~~,2010-10-30~~~,1,1,1,1
I am on option 3 and took out Bt as I was promised 4mg.I have always got 2 or 2.5 until it hit the decks a few weeks ago at 0.06!!!!!After a new hubb and filters Bt engineer came out today and saw that my Bt extention was installed with thin internal wire and had perished on the outside of the house.He said i would never have got good broadband with that wiring.They have now put the correct wiring in and a new linebox which doesn t require filters.Straight away speed is up to 2.2 and am told it should settle to about 3.2 mgs over the next 10 days.customer services told me there was nothing wrong with my connection a month ago.Two weeks ago someone else at customer services confirmed that my line had a problem.seems i have had the wrong wiring for 6 years which was ok until I tried to run broadband off it.~~~,nottingham~~~,2010-10-20~~~,3,3,2,3
We have BT Broadband Option 3  with a Home Hub v2.0 (wireless n).  Performance is pretty good (7MB download) but the connection has a nasty habit of going down 2 or 3 times a week. The hub is great - we have 3 PCs wired into it  and run my daughter's laptop  2 XBoxes and 1 PS3 all wirelessly onto it.  Performance wise it is very good.Customer service wise though BT are a laugh - rather like a bloke trying to get into a woman's pants they will say anything to you  and afterwards they will dump you and ignore you.~~~,Oxfordshire~~~,2010-10-16~~~,4,2,4,3
Very happy with service in general except with speed. But told system being updated to fibre optic in jan 2011. apart from that excellent service and customer service couldn't be more helpful~~~,Crumlin~~~,2010-10-01~~~,4,5,3,5
absolutely shocking!we dont get half the channels and the ones we do are always juddery and cut out  the on demand tv works about 20% of the time  got solf movie channels but all of them are pay-per-view. the phone line is crackley and the internet needs to be restarted every half hour or so. Also even though we have 'unlimited' internet we got charged £100 for excessive usage (thanks to the flatmates bf!) we have never been on hold for less than 30 mins when trying to get help and their explanation was that we lived in a poor reception area... why did you recommend this package  charge and install it for us then!?!this is our first flat and internet ect was the one luxury item we had on our budget. thoroughly disappointed in BT and would never EVER recommend.~~~,chelmsford~~~,2010-09-21~~~,1,1,2,1
"After another problem  this week at 330k on my line and being reported by the ""technical specialists"" at BT as working fine at 7MB (which I've never had!! 2MB at best when it works) I've had enough.  CONTRACT TERMINATED!~~~","Dronfield, Sheffield~~~",2010-09-19~~~,1,1,1,1
Pathetic in all aspects  donload speed 0.4mb to virtually zero at peak times. Died altogether for a week. Customer service is exotic but not very useful.The one area they score big time is billing - they sure know how to do that! Try anywhere but hereI wouldn't even give them one star for some areas but zero not an option.~~~,Barnsley -  the S. Yorks one - sadly~~~,2010-09-08~~~,1,1,1,1
The only reason I am posting a comment is that I have just phoned BT  which took numerous numbers to phone  to upgrade from Option 1 to option 2. Having agreed the upgrade I asked the question about whether this was a new contract  to which the answer was yes. I cancelled it there & then as I only have 4 months left on my current contract & feel it's a complete con.  to start another 12 month contract  especially when I found out only by asking the question.I am an existing BT customer & would stay  but my current view is that I will now move.~~~,Weston-Super-Mare~~~,2010-08-27~~~,2,1,3,4
"Been with BT for years  very reliable service. Paying for up to 8 MG - never had better than 3.5 - they are now advertising ""up to 20"" - I feel that I am paying for this but not close to getting any improved service/speed - paying for unlimited download  had 3 teenagers home from uni at christmas - got ""fair useage"" warnings threatening to slow my download speed - how much slower can it get ? - bills are useless - no idea what I'm paying for - just know that it is costing over £50/month for broadband/ phone line and calls - all on the cheapest rate ! - Overall view - they are ripping me off and hiding it in confusing bills etc~~~",dumfries~~~,2010-08-26~~~,1,1,1,4
Ihave had this package for six weeks it has been unavalable on three occations for up to three days the current speed is 594% less than is avalable in my area the only thing that has been reliable is the apologies from there helplines i have a contract for 1 year i hope the next 11 months sees a vast improvement.~~~,Airdrie~~~,2010-07-14~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
The broadband speeds were originally terrible (30kbps for downloading files (upload speed) and 1mbps for browsing (download speed)) but have now increased to 250kbps upload and 1.5mbps download. These speeds are currently a lot less than BT state  also the spees drops during large file transfers. Their customer service is terrible when we called the helpline all the said was 'We cannot help'. They wanted to sell us BT vision by phone  it was an incovinient time  so we told them to call back later  they never did.~~~,North east England~~~,2010-07-11~~~,2,1,2,3
speed has dropped from a download of 1.8/2mps to 0.3mps and Bt helpdesk insist thisis because of distance from the exchange  3.1km as an BT pensioner I am seriously considering changing isp~~~,Buxton~~~,2010-06-23~~~,1,1,1,1
Utter rubbish  8 weeks we have been telling BT that even though we have a line speed of 5.5meg we can only dl at 1meg max. We are giving up and looking for another ISP. BT can’t/won’t fix this problem for us the India call centre have no clue full stop. Engineers keep saying it’s a software problem with BT Wholesale but India call centre keep sending engineers to property/exchange to perform the same checks over and over again. We could dl at 4.5meg then dropped overnight to 0.5meg. We can't move forward past the same processes. India technical support is the worst  only web based compliants proceedures available and no one calls you about your complaint. You get an automated email and you are left to be worn down and give up by the India call centre.~~~,monmouth~~~,2010-06-15~~~,1,1,1,1
Been with them for three weeks and to say I'm disappointed is a understatement. Its like dial up very poor.~~~,Garthorpe~~~,2010-06-09~~~,1,3,1,2
Although living less than a mile from the ADSL2 enabled exchange BT say 6.9 mb's is about my limit and supplying me with a 20mb line is pointless. All the shouting from BT about rolling out new high speed services seems somewhat over enthuisiastic.~~~,Seaford~~~,2010-06-08~~~,3,2,3,5
most frustraing customer experience of my life. I pay for 8 meg and last year suddenly started getting below 1 meg. 6 months  3 new hubs  countless hours wasted complaining and looking for imaginary faults with my computer and equipment  and many engineers visits later  I am still told that they can find no problem and it must be my fault. Words can't describe my utter contempt and loathing for their company. sickening.~~~,brighton~~~,2010-06-02~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~,~~~
Extremely frustrating experience  speed drops frequently  customer service is run out of India. BT should be a flgship Britih provider  but they are sadly lacking in all areas of cstomer satisfaction.~~~,"Bromsgrove, Worcs~~~",2010-05-20~~~,1,1,1,5
