Bt are awful - terrible communication. I wanted to leave then offered another contract low price with nothing said about being charged over £200. Honestly avoid use another,TOTNES,2021-11-22
Very poor service inspite of being with BT for many years.They will start troubling your broadband if you move to a new provider at least for week or 10 days before the move.Absolutely rubbish customer service,wakefield,2021-11-19
Shambles of a company. I couldn`t use the Broadband due to unforseen circumstances. Bt said no problem they would send a return bag for the router and there would be no charges. 3 months and 3 phone calls later i have been charged £50 with no return bag sent. I have asked for a return address to send the kit back but they won`t give me one. Total rip off company,Stockport,2021-11-14
The service they provide is not close to that which is advertised. The internet speed is shockingly bad and periodically goes down for whole weekends. We have complained many times  however  their customer assistants are useless and unable to help in the slightest. One of the poorest service providers i have ever been with. Would not recommend to anyone who cares about broadband speed  consistency or customer care.,Kirkcaldy,2021-11-14
Existing BT customer here  just looking to change the point the internet cable comes into the house  as part of a refurb. Organised a date with BT 2 weeks ago for an engineer to come and do this. We were given a window of 8am-1pm. No one here by 12.30  so we rang BT customer services and were promised an engineer was on their way and were just held-up. My wife stayed in for the rest of the afternoon  with our 3 young boys  holding up the refurb work  only for no engineer to appear.  We ring BT this evening to understand how no one can appear and how the guidance at midday was that someone was on their way  only to be told that this was booked as a remote service and no one was ever going to come.  Absolutely shocking service. Building works held-up and can’t even find an apology  let alone a suitable revised date for the work.  Will now be leaving the service and would strongly recommend anyone assessing different suppliers to avoid BT. Their service is shockingly bad for such a high profile company.,"Surrey, UK",2021-11-12
Went for a deal with free Fitbit and ‘Great Wi-Fi’ in every room. 3 months on no Fitbit with no help from customer service after several calls and emails. Multiple rooms without any Wi-Fi even though they are 10 meters away from the main Hub.,Reading,2021-11-09
I have taken BT superfibre connection to my work from home. It is the worst decision I made. There was an inordinate delay in getting the connection. (Then 3 blokes came in 3 vans to put ONE wire from the road to the house. One did the work the other 2 merrily chatting away) I wish  Virgin was available in my area ! The speed is supposed to be 300Mb  I hardly get 50 MB. When I call BT they insist the connection is fine. The connection is unstable at best and often I cannot connect 2 devices let alone what is said in their ad! Can Britain not have better internet than this?,Sutton Coldfield,2021-11-09
having switched from sky to b t i can not return to sky quickly enough  The whole experience with B T has been dire broadbad wont connect poor set up by engineer phone line wont work  hours and hours on the phone and computer when they did manage to provide a service BAD BAD BAD,york,2021-11-09
Even putting 1 star is better than they deserve. The absolute worst internet I have ever had. Internet speeds ( by them ) were 15mb lower than they said  and my tests were absolutely disgraceful. I work from home so need a stable connection  however it has been impossible to do ANYTHING. Internet speeds showing a whopping 1mb/s (if that sometimes) pages taking years to load  youtube videos buffering on 240p. I have had to work from my friends house the last 2 weeks because of this and it's totally unacceptable. Never ever using BT again  the service is an absolute joke.,Peterborough,2021-11-08

The absolute worst. Broadband installation is 38 days overdue after a 3 week delay between account setup and the installation. The only time I get updates is when I call  and some unfortunate (very kind) customer service person has explains that they plan to do it in the next week. They never do. Recommend just about anyone else. Truly awful experience  making working from home and moving house an absolute nightmare.,UK,2021-11-04
This has been by far the worst service I have received from a broadband and tv box provider. 1- The TV Box and hub did not arrive until a week later than the starting date and they did not modify the starting date.2- I was promised the big sport package which includes HD channels and had to call 2 times where they said the problem was fixed but it was not. The guys who talked to me did not what were they talking about.3- The third time I get to talk to someone who knows what was talking about. Also  the problem with my tv changed as well so to see HD channels it was asking to upgrade subscription. When I talk to the BT specialist he agreed that I should have HD but that it was not assigned and that I would have to pay extra money to get it. That is when I decided to cancel. Luckily enough I still was within the 14 days free cancelation Do not want to know about BT ever again.3- The sales guy that promise the package for a certain price was a scam. I honestly do not know how this service can get worst.,ABINGDON,2021-11-04
Absolutely shocking reliability. The worst broadband connection I have ever had. Am moving to Community Fiber,London,2021-11-03
Texted BT am as no house phone or internet. Got automated message saying up to 48hrs to  fix. Just 2hrs later engineers attended and fixed fault in street machinery. Everything working perfectly. Can only speak as I find  brilliant service.,St Albans,2021-11-03
I have been stuck with BT for a good part of 2 years (almost). Although the speeds were decent enough for the package I had  the termination of my contract resulted in the worst possible ruckus - long story short; the chat team does not know a thing about how to terminate a contract and there is a lack of communication between various sections. I had to waste 3 mornings (2 weeks distance apart) to get someone to place a return order of my router and have my account cancel on my requested date - And when that was done I found out (a month after) that I was still resulting a regular customer and paying the bills regularly...terrified of having to set up an account with them ever again.,london,2021-10-26
"normally i leave a bad company at 1 star but this is completely abysmal.  rating this 1 star would be generous considering what you actually get from BT.  we get our first BT router a few years back  signed for a year or 2 since they promised good connection.  nope!  couldn't even connect to stuff as simple as video or online meeting.  so we phoned them up and asked for an engineer and the engineer came.  the engineer promised high speeds and set us up onto the ""fastest connection possible"".  looking back on that  i almost fell out of my chair laughing with how false that was.  nothing improved and they charged us anyways without any reason or explanation as to why nothing improved.  naturally  we called again and got set up with new internet.  this has been a bit better but not much.  not to mention  there's zero point reaching out to the support team since they're as about as useful as a rock and will just keep you on an endless loop while being as passive-aggressive as humanly possible.  horrible company.",scotland,2021-10-25
BT boardband unstable and bad customer service.  They expect their customers work around their BT engineers schedule not customers.  BT seems to think their customers can take time off work for their engineers.  I don't understand that why BT engineers are not at services at weekend or evening.  Their fault team is a joke  no customer services at all.  Telling me there was no fault when I have no  wifi for a few days  then told me not to talk over him when he was the one kept interrupting me talking.  Shocking bad services at their fault team.  BT management needs to do better to provide some basic infrastructure to the UK public.,London,2021-10-23
Worst broadband u can have! I had a contract with them when I was living in Luton  was ok...ish But here  In Liverpool is pure ****! In weekend is not working at all and during the week I have max 2.8 mb/s so is useless! I am thinking to make a claim because they don't give me what they said in the contract I will get. Waste of money,Liverpool,2021-10-22
Absolutely awful! Paid for full fibre 900Yes 900 to the hub  then a fluctuating poor WiFi  literally often less than 20mb.After 2 hubs and endless calls from bt I bring home my hub from work  a different make (draytec) Absolutely fine  stable  reliable 700 give or take WiFi..  so in short if you want full fibre then expect to pay out for a hub/router that performs Really really shocking how bad bt hub is,Somerset,2021-10-21
Broadband is reliably slow!! Virgin is x30 faster than by in my area ???,Kirkcaldy,2021-10-19
Absolutely disgusting concept of customer service. Was mis-sold a product that was supposed to provide us with internet until an engineer could come out  that then apparently couldn't be provided until after the service had been connected. What a complete waste of time. The people I had the misfortune of dealing with were unpleasant  argumentative and generally unhelpful  wasting an hour and a half of my afternoon for basically no resolution because everyone is busy blaming each other. Communication is poor and aggressive  and the overall experience makes me severely regret choosing to go with BT at all,Oxfordshire,2021-10-18
Really don’t know what to say! Had high expectations of bt but they were quickly shattered!The speeds are decent…. normally…. Up to 130mbs when plugged in to ethernet however the ping/ latency is shocking! It bounces between 4-500+This makes online gaming extremely frustrating and basically unplayable at some times with being kicked out of games randomly  major lag and certain apps just simply not working. This is console and mobile games. My phone signal is non existent so I’m connected to wifi. When on a call the call often drops. Ironically this has happened multiple times when on the phone to bt. I’ve had them send me multiple external devices which have done nothing. Had engineers come over with the wrong information to begin with then when explaining the problem their response was that they are not trained in latency so they can’t help and proceeded to call the bt call centre and go through options that i’ve already been through multiple times.Incredibly poor and frustrating service! Can’t wait to leave and never come back! Shame on you bt! After reading all these other reviews I honestly can’t believe how bad your service actually is across the country!,Essex,2021-10-13
The worst company eveeeeeer. Problems for 2 months for instalation  later charging me more than they should and extending my ending contract date without any reason. Then calling to finish it and they didn't tell me nothing I needed to send back my router  after month a half receiving email saying if I don't send it back I will get charged after I moved already to another city. Very bad costumer service and Internet working very slow. Never again,Livingston,2021-10-09
I am very unhappy with bt . They donot understand a single word . I just moved othe place from house to flat and i just call them change bt stuff there . I just leaving in  flat and downstairs is a fish shop and what these stupid people done they shift my broadband to the fish shop . And the fish shop business account they stop. They are worse than 5 year old kid . Really very unhappy ☹️ its worst day in my life when i choose this broadband never ever come to this broadband again and also tell about stupidness to others as well. Never tell anyone to have this broadband . Very stupid stafff of bt . The fish got very big losss,Bishop auckland,2021-10-01
Completely unacceptable! I have waited three weeks for my broadband to be installed on 29th of September. No one turned up and I called BT 10min past the scheduled time saying that no one turned up. Now I have to wait another two weeks for the next available appointment  because the technician said that he came to the address  was told that the resident was not aware of any installation and left! I called 10 min after his appointment! Obviously  he just got lost and went to the wrong address and couldn’t be bothered to find the right one! Now I’m suffering for his incompetence! BT just doesn’t care about their customers.... absolutely disgraceful...,Great Missenden,2021-10-01
WARNING IF YOU ARE SEEKING ANY LEVEL OF SERVICE DO NOT ENGAGE WITH BTToday is 29.9.21 I received a message from BT stating that my installation date has been delayed by 7 days to 13.10.21.This shouldn't be the biggest deal in the world and wouldn't if it weren't for the fact that I placed the order on 17.4.21.I get the feeling that they're actually aiming to drag it out for a full six months to wear it as a badge of honour. I have spent over 15 hours on hold. I have been billed monthly for a service I don't receive and have had complaints closed down without any rhyme nor reason. The communication network is set up so you can't have a single point of contact so when they promise this  that promise is made in the full knowledge that they cannot be acting in good faith,Belfast,2021-09-29
I've been with BT for 21 months now (forced due to them owning the FTTP or something on this new property). For those 21 months  we've had terrible wifi connections and speeds even though it was the 150MB deal and the devices would keep disconnecting continuously. Today I spoke to Elle from customer service who has not able to offer anything remotely competitive to competitors including their own new customer offers. She also was not honest about prices when asked and gave old prices as supposed to current deals and was not honest about what day I could cancel my contract whilst providing 30 days notice and not incurring any fees. Overall terrible experience and would not recommend to anyone. Even 1 star is unfair to the star itself!,london,2021-09-28
This is the most abysmal customer service I have ever experienced. After signing up for broadband our WiFi abruptly cut out after 2 weeks. We contacted BT customer service and tried to get an explanation. They told us that the account had been declared void by a computer error. Instead of helping us they shunted us between different customer service departments and offered no solutions. We were told 3 times that a manager would contact us within 3 hours  but 3 times we were ignored. BT then told us that we had to re-create our account and re-install wifi. They refused to move up appointments   meaning that we had to wait 2 weeks for an engineer to come out. I am a key worker  who works primarily with children with barriers to learning who have been adversely affected by covid 19  and my partner is studying for her PHD. Both of our day to day lives have been significantly disrupted. BT’s solution for this was to tell us to contact ANOTHER WiFi provider to get a Dongle  which they assured us they would re-reimburse us for. So far we have heard nothing. In summation  we are £120 out of pocket with no WiFi to date.,Edinburgh,2021-09-27
I’ve had a scheduled and confirmed appointment for the engineer to arrive and install my wifi on the 27th September between 8am-1pm. Like a moron i got up early and eagerly awaited for their visit. After 1pm came i called BT up and was informed that my appointment is now on the 30th and that the next one available if i can’t make that one will be on the 11th october. I was not contacted in any manner to be updated about my appointment. Not by phone not by email or otherwise. When i called the agent on phone she just kept spinning circles in conversation wasting even more of my time basically just repeating in a million different ways there’s nothing i can do and no way i can help you. So now i have no choice but to be home Thursday and lose out on a day’s worth of money at work or otherwise wait like a jackass for another 2-3 weeks for the next appointment. Great. And I already had this date booked off specifically for this and lost money by not going to work.  Not to mention i live in an area where the connection is so bad for both mobile services and internet that i had to step out on my balcony just to have the conversation with the agent that done nothing for me. They should make you aware from the beginning that the installation process will take a month or so instead of wasting your time and disappointing you when they don’t show up and rescheduled without any notice. I work online as well so the it might not seem like 3 days makes a difference but it does. I’m losing money each and every day because of it. And as i understand the wifi will take another 10 days to settle in after installation… i just pray to god the connection will be better than the service i was given so far… The salesman i spoke to was great very helpful when it came to understanding what I’d get and what I could expect and convincing to boot. I wish the customer service would match the sales force effort. Maybe that would actually give some service.,"Brentwood, UK",2021-09-27
Possibly  nope definitely the worst company to be with. When i have managed to get through to customer service  i have been spoken to like a piece of rubbish. The internet is rubbish and when some one calls the house phone the internet goes off. If Virgin were in the street i would be happy to pay the extra and go with them. I would not recommend BT to any one  a total waste of time.,Brownhills,2021-09-26
Never got equipment. Order  was frozen  . Ended  up staying  with  virgin .was not  told  order  was frozen,Liverpool,2021-09-23
Don't be fooled by the speed guarantees from BT. I have 900mbps full fibre to home. The max I get is around 230mbps but this varies to as low as 10mpbs frequently.  This has been raised multiple times with BT who have said they only guarantee the speed to the house. What their hubs pump out is NOT guaranteed. So far:- I've spent hours on the phone to support (even longer on hold)- I'm on my 5th hub  all the same issue- Have been sent 3 discs. Same issue. - Engineer came out and confirmed their was an issue. He couldn't fix it and said I need an SITF?? engineer to check wifi issues. - I've had 2 Openreach engineers  who also confirmed there was a problem but couldn't fix it. They suggested I get a new hub with the latest firmware. - Had to call up and order new hub  delivered but same problem. - Booked MOT check and the original engineer came out who said the same thing as before. Couldn't fix it and I need SITF engineer.  ps I live in a detached new build house. The walls are paper thin and there is nothing around that would cause any significant wifi interference.  I'm not getting speeds anywhere near what was offered upon purchase and I feel the package was miss sold.,Glos,2021-09-22
Completely hopeless at everything. I gave up with them  having spent 4 hours on the phone in 2 days trying to spend money with them!,FAREHAM,2021-09-21
This is the first bad review I've actively given besides the odd verbal comment in 32 years  the customer service and situation I have been left in as a BT customer is disgusting. Two nights ago around 10pm I received 3 emails all at once stating my WiFi would be shut off and account closed  a few minutes later the WiFi was off. I called the next day to find out what had happened as I'd never missed a payment and had a package deal through EE  I was informed I'd not payed a £11.13 charge for installation 4 month prior which was confusing  I'd never had an installation as the landline had been in and working for years. How've after looking back I did find the email with the charge so after paying £92 with extra charges I was told I could have the WiFi back on.... Only to then be told my account has been closed anyway  I was then asked to return my hub and that if I wanted to continue with my service I might be given a more expensive plan  I was then told if I wanted to cancel I would have to pay cancellation charges for the remainder of my contract which was 18 months. After trying to explain I didn't want to cancel my contract you cancelled on me and that I wanted it to keep working as before I was then told to call back tomorrow afternoon sometime around 3pm and speak to the sales team. The conversation the next day turned out to be a positive one with the customer service person saying i can start a new contract exactly the same as the old one and have you up and running straight away  wait 10 minutes for a confirmation email then that's everything... The email informed me that I was being charged another £40 connection charge  £9.95 delivery for a new hub which would arrive in 11 days  as someone who works from home my business cannot function without using the internet and while still being charged for an account that I've never missed a payment on and still having the original hub plugged in flashing purple I'm left feeling utterly defeated and unable to earn a living. Again this is the first negative review I have ever left but it took a mighty difficult situation to do so  apologies if I've waffled on but this company is horrendous. For anyone reading this you'd be better off signing up with THREE,Sheffield,2021-09-18
Not reliable  they had to give me a refund in the past as broadband not working. Yet again it failed today and no way to get access. This could last at least 2 days. Terrible customer service. I will go to another provider the moment that I get out of my contract!,Folkestone,2021-09-14
Waited in for an engineer and nobody turned up then rebooked the appointment and the same happened again! Still haven’t got internet and they said there’s nothing they can do just book again.,Bradford,2021-09-10
Terrible costumer service. Wasted 1.5h setting up a contract. They misspelled the address and now they are asking me to redo all 1.5h of setting up a new contract. They can not change a simple details THEY got wrong. Ridiculous.,London,2021-09-10
Waste of time you don’t get any where near the speeds you pay for. The customer service is awful put simply don’t bother,Birmingham,2021-09-09
Absolutely irresponsible service. The engineers didn’t turn up on the date I have been given. When I called BT customer service they don’t have any clue/ they did not contact the open reach. The date I was given was 3 weeks after order — very delayed set up dates.Even after waiting 3 weeks nothing has been done by them.  Then they have me another 3 weeks time. Which means 6 weeks for installation. No communication from them. I had to call millions of time to understand what’s happening. And when you call each person come up with differing information. Basically I fed up with the long wait and moved to virgin. They gave me 1 week time to set up. Let’s see what virgin can do!,Datchet,2021-09-09
Waited over a month for a refunded bill. Refunded me £5! Had to to ring multiple times this week to chase and get my full refund of £40 to be told today I would be receiving it by check in the next 10 days. Quick enough to take it tho! I cancelled within the first week coz your engineer couldn't be bothered to fit the router in my living room and left wires all over the floor when I have a 1 year old and a puppy. Nothing but hard work. Wouldn't advise anybody to use BT,Preston,2021-09-07

"normally i leave a bad company at 1 star but this is completely abysmal.  rating this 1 star would be generous considering what you actually get from BT.  we get our first BT router a few years back  signed for a year or 2 since they promised good connection.  nope!  couldn't even connect to stuff as simple as video or online meeting.  so we phoned them up and asked for an engineer and the engineer came.  the engineer promised high speeds and set us up onto the ""fastest connection possible"".  looking back on that  i almost fell out of my chair laughing with how false that was.  nothing improved and they charged us anyways without any reason or explanation as to why nothing improved.  naturally  we called again and got set up with new internet.  this has been a bit better but not much.  not to mention  there's zero point reaching out to the support team since they're as about as useful as a rock and will just keep you on an endless loop while being as passive-aggressive as humanly possible.  horrible company.",scotland,2021-10-25
BT boardband unstable and bad customer service.  They expect their customers work around their BT engineers schedule not customers.  BT seems to think their customers can take time off work for their engineers.  I don't understand that why BT engineers are not at services at weekend or evening.  Their fault team is a joke  no customer services at all.  Telling me there was no fault when I have no  wifi for a few days  then told me not to talk over him when he was the one kept interrupting me talking.  Shocking bad services at their fault team.  BT management needs to do better to provide some basic infrastructure to the UK public.,London,2021-10-23
Worst broadband u can have! I had a contract with them when I was living in Luton  was ok...ish But here  In Liverpool is pure ****! In weekend is not working at all and during the week I have max 2.8 mb/s so is useless! I am thinking to make a claim because they don't give me what they said in the contract I will get. Waste of money,Liverpool,2021-10-22
Absolutely awful! Paid for full fibre 900Yes 900 to the hub  then a fluctuating poor WiFi  literally often less than 20mb.After 2 hubs and endless calls from bt I bring home my hub from work  a different make (draytec) Absolutely fine  stable  reliable 700 give or take WiFi..  so in short if you want full fibre then expect to pay out for a hub/router that performs Really really shocking how bad bt hub is,Somerset,2021-10-21
Broadband is reliably slow!! Virgin is x30 faster than by in my area ???,Kirkcaldy,2021-10-19
Absolutely disgusting concept of customer service. Was mis-sold a product that was supposed to provide us with internet until an engineer could come out  that then apparently couldn't be provided until after the service had been connected. What a complete waste of time. The people I had the misfortune of dealing with were unpleasant  argumentative and generally unhelpful  wasting an hour and a half of my afternoon for basically no resolution because everyone is busy blaming each other. Communication is poor and aggressive  and the overall experience makes me severely regret choosing to go with BT at all,Oxfordshire,2021-10-18
Really don’t know what to say! Had high expectations of bt but they were quickly shattered!The speeds are decent…. normally…. Up to 130mbs when plugged in to ethernet however the ping/ latency is shocking! It bounces between 4-500+This makes online gaming extremely frustrating and basically unplayable at some times with being kicked out of games randomly  major lag and certain apps just simply not working. This is console and mobile games. My phone signal is non existent so I’m connected to wifi. When on a call the call often drops. Ironically this has happened multiple times when on the phone to bt. I’ve had them send me multiple external devices which have done nothing. Had engineers come over with the wrong information to begin with then when explaining the problem their response was that they are not trained in latency so they can’t help and proceeded to call the bt call centre and go through options that i’ve already been through multiple times.Incredibly poor and frustrating service! Can’t wait to leave and never come back! Shame on you bt! After reading all these other reviews I honestly can’t believe how bad your service actually is across the country!,Essex,2021-10-13
The worst company eveeeeeer. Problems for 2 months for instalation  later charging me more than they should and extending my ending contract date without any reason. Then calling to finish it and they didn't tell me nothing I needed to send back my router  after month a half receiving email saying if I don't send it back I will get charged after I moved already to another city. Very bad costumer service and Internet working very slow. Never again,Livingston,2021-10-09
I am very unhappy with bt . They donot understand a single word . I just moved othe place from house to flat and i just call them change bt stuff there . I just leaving in  flat and downstairs is a fish shop and what these stupid people done they shift my broadband to the fish shop . And the fish shop business account they stop. They are worse than 5 year old kid . Really very unhappy ☹️ its worst day in my life when i choose this broadband never ever come to this broadband again and also tell about stupidness to others as well. Never tell anyone to have this broadband . Very stupid stafff of bt . The fish got very big losss,Bishop auckland,2021-10-01
Completely unacceptable! I have waited three weeks for my broadband to be installed on 29th of September. No one turned up and I called BT 10min past the scheduled time saying that no one turned up. Now I have to wait another two weeks for the next available appointment  because the technician said that he came to the address  was told that the resident was not aware of any installation and left! I called 10 min after his appointment! Obviously  he just got lost and went to the wrong address and couldn’t be bothered to find the right one! Now I’m suffering for his incompetence! BT just doesn’t care about their customers.... absolutely disgraceful...,Great Missenden,2021-10-01
WARNING IF YOU ARE SEEKING ANY LEVEL OF SERVICE DO NOT ENGAGE WITH BTToday is 29.9.21 I received a message from BT stating that my installation date has been delayed by 7 days to 13.10.21.This shouldn't be the biggest deal in the world and wouldn't if it weren't for the fact that I placed the order on 17.4.21.I get the feeling that they're actually aiming to drag it out for a full six months to wear it as a badge of honour. I have spent over 15 hours on hold. I have been billed monthly for a service I don't receive and have had complaints closed down without any rhyme nor reason. The communication network is set up so you can't have a single point of contact so when they promise this  that promise is made in the full knowledge that they cannot be acting in good faith,Belfast,2021-09-29
I've been with BT for 21 months now (forced due to them owning the FTTP or something on this new property). For those 21 months  we've had terrible wifi connections and speeds even though it was the 150MB deal and the devices would keep disconnecting continuously. Today I spoke to Elle from customer service who has not able to offer anything remotely competitive to competitors including their own new customer offers. She also was not honest about prices when asked and gave old prices as supposed to current deals and was not honest about what day I could cancel my contract whilst providing 30 days notice and not incurring any fees. Overall terrible experience and would not recommend to anyone. Even 1 star is unfair to the star itself!,london,2021-09-28
This is the most abysmal customer service I have ever experienced. After signing up for broadband our WiFi abruptly cut out after 2 weeks. We contacted BT customer service and tried to get an explanation. They told us that the account had been declared void by a computer error. Instead of helping us they shunted us between different customer service departments and offered no solutions. We were told 3 times that a manager would contact us within 3 hours  but 3 times we were ignored. BT then told us that we had to re-create our account and re-install wifi. They refused to move up appointments   meaning that we had to wait 2 weeks for an engineer to come out. I am a key worker  who works primarily with children with barriers to learning who have been adversely affected by covid 19  and my partner is studying for her PHD. Both of our day to day lives have been significantly disrupted. BT’s solution for this was to tell us to contact ANOTHER WiFi provider to get a Dongle  which they assured us they would re-reimburse us for. So far we have heard nothing. In summation  we are £120 out of pocket with no WiFi to date.,Edinburgh,2021-09-27
I’ve had a scheduled and confirmed appointment for the engineer to arrive and install my wifi on the 27th September between 8am-1pm. Like a moron i got up early and eagerly awaited for their visit. After 1pm came i called BT up and was informed that my appointment is now on the 30th and that the next one available if i can’t make that one will be on the 11th october. I was not contacted in any manner to be updated about my appointment. Not by phone not by email or otherwise. When i called the agent on phone she just kept spinning circles in conversation wasting even more of my time basically just repeating in a million different ways there’s nothing i can do and no way i can help you. So now i have no choice but to be home Thursday and lose out on a day’s worth of money at work or otherwise wait like a jackass for another 2-3 weeks for the next appointment. Great. And I already had this date booked off specifically for this and lost money by not going to work.  Not to mention i live in an area where the connection is so bad for both mobile services and internet that i had to step out on my balcony just to have the conversation with the agent that done nothing for me. They should make you aware from the beginning that the installation process will take a month or so instead of wasting your time and disappointing you when they don’t show up and rescheduled without any notice. I work online as well so the it might not seem like 3 days makes a difference but it does. I’m losing money each and every day because of it. And as i understand the wifi will take another 10 days to settle in after installation… i just pray to god the connection will be better than the service i was given so far… The salesman i spoke to was great very helpful when it came to understanding what I’d get and what I could expect and convincing to boot. I wish the customer service would match the sales force effort. Maybe that would actually give some service.,"Brentwood, UK",2021-09-27
Possibly  nope definitely the worst company to be with. When i have managed to get through to customer service  i have been spoken to like a piece of rubbish. The internet is rubbish and when some one calls the house phone the internet goes off. If Virgin were in the street i would be happy to pay the extra and go with them. I would not recommend BT to any one  a total waste of time.,Brownhills,2021-09-26
Never got equipment. Order  was frozen  . Ended  up staying  with  virgin .was not  told  order  was frozen,Liverpool,2021-09-23
Don't be fooled by the speed guarantees from BT. I have 900mbps full fibre to home. The max I get is around 230mbps but this varies to as low as 10mpbs frequently.  This has been raised multiple times with BT who have said they only guarantee the speed to the house. What their hubs pump out is NOT guaranteed. So far:- I've spent hours on the phone to support (even longer on hold)- I'm on my 5th hub  all the same issue- Have been sent 3 discs. Same issue. - Engineer came out and confirmed their was an issue. He couldn't fix it and said I need an SITF?? engineer to check wifi issues. - I've had 2 Openreach engineers  who also confirmed there was a problem but couldn't fix it. They suggested I get a new hub with the latest firmware. - Had to call up and order new hub  delivered but same problem. - Booked MOT check and the original engineer came out who said the same thing as before. Couldn't fix it and I need SITF engineer.  ps I live in a detached new build house. The walls are paper thin and there is nothing around that would cause any significant wifi interference.  I'm not getting speeds anywhere near what was offered upon purchase and I feel the package was miss sold.,Glos,2021-09-22
Completely hopeless at everything. I gave up with them  having spent 4 hours on the phone in 2 days trying to spend money with them!,FAREHAM,2021-09-21
This is the first bad review I've actively given besides the odd verbal comment in 32 years  the customer service and situation I have been left in as a BT customer is disgusting. Two nights ago around 10pm I received 3 emails all at once stating my WiFi would be shut off and account closed  a few minutes later the WiFi was off. I called the next day to find out what had happened as I'd never missed a payment and had a package deal through EE  I was informed I'd not payed a £11.13 charge for installation 4 month prior which was confusing  I'd never had an installation as the landline had been in and working for years. How've after looking back I did find the email with the charge so after paying £92 with extra charges I was told I could have the WiFi back on.... Only to then be told my account has been closed anyway  I was then asked to return my hub and that if I wanted to continue with my service I might be given a more expensive plan  I was then told if I wanted to cancel I would have to pay cancellation charges for the remainder of my contract which was 18 months. After trying to explain I didn't want to cancel my contract you cancelled on me and that I wanted it to keep working as before I was then told to call back tomorrow afternoon sometime around 3pm and speak to the sales team. The conversation the next day turned out to be a positive one with the customer service person saying i can start a new contract exactly the same as the old one and have you up and running straight away  wait 10 minutes for a confirmation email then that's everything... The email informed me that I was being charged another £40 connection charge  £9.95 delivery for a new hub which would arrive in 11 days  as someone who works from home my business cannot function without using the internet and while still being charged for an account that I've never missed a payment on and still having the original hub plugged in flashing purple I'm left feeling utterly defeated and unable to earn a living. Again this is the first negative review I have ever left but it took a mighty difficult situation to do so  apologies if I've waffled on but this company is horrendous. For anyone reading this you'd be better off signing up with THREE,Sheffield,2021-09-18
Not reliable  they had to give me a refund in the past as broadband not working. Yet again it failed today and no way to get access. This could last at least 2 days. Terrible customer service. I will go to another provider the moment that I get out of my contract!,Folkestone,2021-09-14
Waited in for an engineer and nobody turned up then rebooked the appointment and the same happened again! Still haven’t got internet and they said there’s nothing they can do just book again.,Bradford,2021-09-10
Terrible costumer service. Wasted 1.5h setting up a contract. They misspelled the address and now they are asking me to redo all 1.5h of setting up a new contract. They can not change a simple details THEY got wrong. Ridiculous.,London,2021-09-10
Waste of time you don’t get any where near the speeds you pay for. The customer service is awful put simply don’t bother,Birmingham,2021-09-09
Absolutely irresponsible service. The engineers didn’t turn up on the date I have been given. When I called BT customer service they don’t have any clue/ they did not contact the open reach. The date I was given was 3 weeks after order — very delayed set up dates.Even after waiting 3 weeks nothing has been done by them.  Then they have me another 3 weeks time. Which means 6 weeks for installation. No communication from them. I had to call millions of time to understand what’s happening. And when you call each person come up with differing information. Basically I fed up with the long wait and moved to virgin. They gave me 1 week time to set up. Let’s see what virgin can do!,Datchet,2021-09-09
Waited over a month for a refunded bill. Refunded me £5! Had to to ring multiple times this week to chase and get my full refund of £40 to be told today I would be receiving it by check in the next 10 days. Quick enough to take it tho! I cancelled within the first week coz your engineer couldn't be bothered to fit the router in my living room and left wires all over the floor when I have a 1 year old and a puppy. Nothing but hard work. Wouldn't advise anybody to use BT,Preston,2021-09-07
